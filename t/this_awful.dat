500|$|Those in the {{lifeboats}} were {{horrified to}} {{hear the sound of}} what Lawrence Beesley called [...] "every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled– I am certain of those– with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How is it possible that <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> thing is happening to me? That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E

500|$|Bede {{does not}} mention {{the cause of the}} battle, simply saying that it {{occurred}} in the ninth year of Ecgfrith's reign. [...] He is more informative on the outcome. Ælfwine, the young subking of Deira, was killed; Ælfwine was brother to Osthryth and Ecgfrith, and was well liked in both Mercia and Northumbria since Æthelred's marriage to Osthryth. [...] According to Bede, his death threatened to cause further strife between the two kingdoms, but Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury, intervened:Theodore, the beloved of God, enlisting God's help, smothered the flames of <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> peril by his wholesome advice. [...] As a result, peace was restored between the kings and peoples, and in lieu of further bloodshed the customary compensation was paid to King Ecgfrith for his brother's death.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Boxer" [...] was {{directed}} by London-based director duo Ne-o, Jake Knight and Ryoko Tanaka. [...] "Originally we were on holiday in Hong Kong and had an awful situation, as we were in an active pitch for a famous band and we didn't like the music," [...] Knight said. [...] "We were sent a track which had <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> DRM attached and it was frustrating us trying to play it through dial-up connection. Someone else sent us another track which was a simple MP3." [...] Tanaka eventually {{came up with the}} idea of a ball that [...] "connected through things". Knight didn't quite understand the idea at first, but through a process of miscommunication, they wrote the video's treatment about [...] "a crazy basketball" [...] which was the quickest treatment they had ever written at the time.|$|E
500|$|President Clinton {{stated that}} after seeing images of babies being {{pulled from the}} wreckage, he was [...] "beyond angry" [...] and wanted to [...] "put [...] fist through the television". Clinton and his wife Hillary {{requested}} that aides talk to child care specialists about how {{to communicate with the}} children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> thing... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood {{and we are going to}} get through this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat up straight in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

2500|$|Despite such friction, their {{relationship}} {{continued to be}} close. When Stanton died in 1902, Anthony wrote to a friend: [...] "Oh, <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> hush!

2500|$|By July 1918, {{there was}} open {{criticism}} of the National Shipyards proposals in the House of Commons. [...] The Liberal M.P. Gerald France stated that the issue had [...] "become not a war emergency... but a speculative adventure", and Sir Hamar Greenwood described the initiative as a [...] "scandal". [...] Greenwood went on:"What really is a serious {{matter is that the}} time and energy of the War Cabinet, which should think of nothing but <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> War, where men are slaughtered daily, have been wasted by innumerable deputations, by arguments for and against, and by the pursuit of this phantom of a great national shipyard on the mud flats of a river in the West of England. Up to the present not a ship has been produced, and {{there is no sign of}} a ship being produced for years. I urge the Government, however foolish it has been, to be strong enough now to stop this blunder." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Commission Court {{opened on}} 20 May, and Baron Lefroy {{proceeded}} {{to charge the}} grand jury. On Monday the foreman handed down a true bill against Mitchel. The Clerk of the Crown asked for what the bill was. To illustrate the rapidity with which the whole case was despatched; and the absolute indifference [...] "whether there was justice done or not," [...] P.A. Sillard, one of Mitchel's biographers, quoted from the speech of Mitchel's defence Council Robert Holms, [...] "The foreman of the Grand Jury, gentlemen, having been asked if the jury had found bills against the prisoner—replied— 'Oh yes, we find him guilty of sedition.' 'Gentlemen,' said the officer of the court, 'he is not indicted for sedition.' 'Well,' said the fore man, 'we find him guilty of treason.' 'But, gentlemen,' again interrupted the officer, 'the charge against Mr Mitchel is for felony.' 'Oh, no matter!' said the foreman, 'sedition, treason, or felony, {{it is all the}} same to us." [...] Sillard concluded, [...] "Justice! the thing is not to be had in British law courts. The petty jury having been sworn, the remaining portion of <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> scene was very quickly gone through." ...|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|But when, as is true, {{we find it}} wanting in {{all these}} claims to the public confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, {{it is not even}} disrespectful, to treat it as not having yet quite {{established}} a settled doctrine for the country.

60|$|But {{already she}} had {{recovered}} from this sudden attack of faintness and dizziness, of which, with characteristic impatience for all feminine weaknesses, {{she was now}} thoroughly ashamed.

2500|$|... but {{the animal}} {{knew better than}} I what was forthcoming, and instead of going faster, so nearly stopped that I remarked he placed one foot after another {{on the ground with}} as much {{precaution}} as if walking on a smooth piece of ice. I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.|$|E
2500|$|Asher {{explains}} that he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their [...] "experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth". He maintains that his contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly {{as a source of}} second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, Asher clarified, [...] "The general tenor of the lyrics was always his... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter." [...] While speaking about [...] "God Only Knows", Wilson reflected: [...] "I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper... because I had never written that kind of song. And I remember him talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs." [...] A typical writing session would either start with Wilson playing melody or chord patterns that he'd been working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. Asher called his interactions with Wilson and the Beach Boys an [...] "embarrassing" [...] experience, and that Wilson [...] "exhibit <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book [...] he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E

Norma demands that he forever shun Adalgisa; only then will she release him and never see him again. He refuses, and she vents her anger by telling him that she will then kill her children. [...] "Strike me instead", he demands, [...] "so that only I alone will die", but she quickly asserts that not only will all the Romans die, but so will Adalgisa, who has broken her vows as a priestess. This prompts him to plead for her life. (Cabaletta: Norma and Pollione: Già mi pasco ne' tuoi sguardi / [...] "Already I take {{pleasure}} in the look you give me, your grief and in her death; at last I can make you as miserable as I".) When Pollione demands the knife, she calls the priests to assemble. Norma announces {{that it would be}} better to sacrifice a priestess who has broken her vows, and orders the pyre to be lit. Oroveso demands to know who is to be sacrificed while Pollione demands that she keep silent, but Norma then reveals that it is she who is to be the victim because she is the guilty one, a high Priestess who has broken her vows, has become involved with the enemy, and has borne his children. (Aria, Norma to Pollione: Qual cor tradisti / [...] "May <b>this</b> <b>awful</b> moment now show you the heart you betrayed and lost"; Duet: Norma and Pollione; Ensemble, Norma, Oroveso, Pollione, Druids, Priests: each expresses his/her sorrow, anger, pleas to Norma, with Oroveso learning for the first time that Norma is a mother.) ...|$|E
