5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{investigation of}} Martin's {{relationship with the}} school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.|$|E
5|$|Since 1988, {{participation}} in Australia Day has increased, and in 1994 all states and territories began {{to celebrate a}} unified public holiday on the actual day for the first time. Research conducted in 2007 reported that 27.6% of Australians polled attended an organised Australia Day event and a further 25.6% celebrated with family and friends, making Australia Day the largest annual public event in the nation. This reflected <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earlier research project where 66% of respondents anticipated that they would actively celebrate Australia Day 2005.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
