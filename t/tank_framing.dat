Like the 2361s, the 1661s carried long boilers (10 ft barrel) when new, but shorter boilers were fitted on overhaul.

40|$|AbstractThe current {{designs of}} {{supporting}} structures of elevated water tanks are tremendously vulnerable under lateral forces {{due to an}} earthquake and the Bhuj (India) earthquake provided another illustration when {{a great number of}} water <b>tanks</b> with <b>frame</b> staging suffered damage and a few collapsed. Liquid storage tanks and particularly elevated reservoirs including structures with very high significance and elements of the main arteries are considered. In the past earthquakes, it has been identified that the reinforced concrete water tanks under lateral earthquake loads have been extremely susceptible, so that in some cases, these tanks had suffered collapse. According to the studies it was found that current detriment in frame staging, creating plastic hinges in beams and columns and created deep cracks in the columns which are in place to connect container. In this paper, at first by studying the losses occurred in reservoirs during past earthquakes, the reasons for these occurred damages studied and then so provide patterns for these damages in structures. In comparison with reinforced concrete elevated water tanks with shaft staging, the reinforced concrete elevated water <b>tanks</b> with <b>frame</b> staging have shown better seismic behavior to resistant against lateral loads. Considering the fact that damage pattern recognition is necessary to the appropriate analyze in reservoirs in the methods of nonlinear and dynamic, so the main objective {{of this paper is to}} obtain the damage pattern in reservoirs for using in analytical methods.

40|$|The {{asymmetry}} phenomenon {{observed during}} the load-loss test of three-phase transformers is rigorously analyzed. The transformer is {{represented as a}} three-port impedance network despite its six-port network nature, making any formal study more tractable. The analytical restrictions required for such a representation are derived. As a result, {{it is possible to}} mathematically prove (and understand) the asymmetrical behavior of a three-phase transformer subjected to the load-loss test. Only two circuit-field simulations or tests (single-phase load-loss tests) are required to obtain the impedance system of the six-winding transformer.
