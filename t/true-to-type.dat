The clonal sweetpotato collection at CIP was initiated in the 1980 ’s and for 60 % of the collection, original material still exists as potted plants in the greenhouse. This provides a unique opportunity where genetic integrity of a clonal collection, maintained in vitro for the past thirty years, can be confirmed by a side-by-side comparison of the same accession from the greenhouse. Initial molecular comparison is done using a set of twenty SSR primers followed by side-by-side comparison in the field using 30 morphological descriptors. Confirmation of identity requires both genetic and morphological analysis as a low percentage of the accessions appear to be duplicates based on SSR yet are morphologically distinct.

40|$|Embryogenic {{suspensions}} {{that involve}} extensive cell division are risky {{in respect to}} genome and epigenome instability. Elevated frequencies of somaclonal variation in embryogenic suspension-derived plants were reported in many species, including coffee. This problem could be overcome by using culture conditions that allow moderate cell proliferation. In view of <b>true-to-type</b> large-scale propagation of C. arabica hybrids, suspension protocols based on low 2, 4 -D concentrations and short proliferation periods were developed. As mechanisms leading to somaclonal variation are often complex, the phenotypic, genetic and epigenetic changes were jointly assessed so as to accurately evaluate the conformity of suspension-derived plants. The effects of embryogenic suspensions and secondary embryogenesis, used as proliferation systems, on the genetic conformity of somatic embryogenesis-derived plants (emblings) were assessed in two hybrids. When applied over a 6 month period, both systems ensured very low somaclonal variation rates, as observed through massive phenotypic observations in field plots (0. 74 % from 200 000 plant). Molecular AFLP and MSAP analyses performed on 145 three year-old emblings showed that polymorphism between mother plants and emblings was extremely low, i. e. ranges of 0 - 0. 003 % and 0. 07 - 0. 18 % respectively, with {{no significant difference between}} the proliferation systems for the two hybrids. No embling was found to cumulate more than three methylation polymorphisms. No relation was established between the variant phenotype (27 variants studied) and a particular MSAP pattern. Chromosome counting showed that 7 of the 11 variant emblings analyzed were characterized by the loss of 1 - 3 chromosomes. This work showed that both embryogenic suspensions and secondary embryogenesis are reliable for <b>true-to-type</b> propagation of elite material. Molecular analyses revealed that genetic and epigenetic alterations are particularly limited during coffee somatic embryogenesis. The main change in most of the rare phenotypic variants was aneuploidy, indicating that mitotic aberrations play a major role in somaclonal variation in coffee. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Coconut palms are {{classified}} into two major types, viz., ‘talls’ and ‘dwarfs’, which mainly {{differ in their}} pollination behavior of cross- and self-pollination, respectively.

The conventional practice of selection of seedlings based solely on morphological traits often results in selection of out-crossed seedlings and undesirable off-types. In the present investigation, RAPD markers for the tall/dwarf trait were identified in coconut using a bulked DNA approach. Screening of tall and dwarf palm bulk DNA with 200 primers revealed a RAPD primer OPBA 3 which was able to clearly differentiate both the tall and dwarf bulks. For validation, the primer was used to screen individual tall and dwarf coconut palms representing different geographic regions. The primer was also used to screen the parents and validate hybrids of Dwarf x Tall crosses. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Before {{cryopreservation}} {{is routinely}} used, {{its effect on}} the trueness-to-type of the regenerated plant material needs to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we studied the effect of seed cryopreservation on the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of wild Solanum lycopersicum Mill. plants. METHODS: Thirty-five morphological traits of plants regenerated from cryopreserved seeds were compared to those measured on plants regenerated from non-cryopreserved seeds. RESULT: No statistically significant differences were observed between cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved samples, either in the first or in the second generation post-liquid nitrogen exposure. However, at the molecular level, the genetic analyses performed on the second generation plants germinated from control and cryopreserved seeds using 14 nuclear Simple Sequences Repeats (SSR) markers uncovered some changes in microsatellite length between control and cryopreserved samples.

40|$|Cryopreservation is the {{technology}} of choice not only for plant genetic resource preservation but also for virus eradication and for the efficient management of large-scale micropropagation. In this chapter, we describe three cryopreservation protocols (standard vitrification, droplet vitrification, and encapsulation vitrification) for date palm highly proliferating meristems that are initiated from vitro-cultures using plant growth regulator-free MS medium. The positive impact of sucrose preculture and cold hardening treatments on survival rates is significant. Regeneration rates obtained with standard vitrification, encapsulation-vitrification, and droplet-vitrification protocols can reach 30, 40, and 70 %, respectively. All regenerated plants from non-cryopreserved or cryopreserved explants don't show morphological variation by maintaining genetic integrity without adverse effect of cryogenic treatment. Cryopreservation of date palm vitro-cultures enables commercial tissue culture laboratories to move to large-scale propagation from cryopreserved cell lines producing <b>true-to-type</b> plants after clonal field-testing trials. When comparing the cost of cryostorage and in-field conservation of date palm cultivars, tissue cryopreservation is the most cost-effective. Moreover, many of the risks linked to field conservation like erosion due to climatic, edaphic, and phytopathologic constraints are circumvented. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Micropropagation {{has been}} a {{well-established}} methodology for in vitro regeneration of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), usually through shoot apical meristem culture or adventitious bud formation. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that micropropagated plants often show genetic discrepancy from the mother plant, due to high levels of PGRs applied. Here we present an efficient protocol for rapid in vitro regeneration of grapevine cv. Agiorgitiko genotypes through nodal culture. Development of a single main shoot was prominent on agar-solidified basal MS medium without any PGR or supplemented with relatively low levels (e. g., up to 2. 5 µM) of benzyladenine (BA). At higher BA levels axillary bud growth and shoot multiplication were enhanced, but hyperhydricity was also apparent. Relatively low concentrations of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) promoted both the frequency of shoots forming roots and the number of roots per shoot. Although the overall yield is rather lower compared with shoot tip culture approaches, present protocol may serve as an alternative for <b>true-to-type</b> regeneration of selected clones of ‘Agiorgitiko ’ and possibly of other grapevine cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Grapevine {{can be a}} {{periclinal}} chimera plant {{which is}} composed at least of two distinct cell layers (L 1, L 2). When the cell layers of this plant are separated by passage through somatic embryogenesis, regenerated plants could show distinct DNA profiles and a novel phenotype which proved {{different from that of}} the parent plant. Results Genetically Chardonnay clone 96 is a periclinal chimera plant in which is L 1 and L 2 cell layers are distinct. Plants obtained via organogenesis through meristematic bulks are shown to be composed of both cell layers. However, plants regenerated through somatic embryogenesis starting from anthers or nodal explants are composed only of L 1 cells. These somaclones do not show phenotypic differences to the parental clone up to three years after regeneration. Interestingly, the only somaclone showing an atypical phenotype (asymmetric leave) shows a genotypic modification. Conclusion These results suggest that the phenotype of Chardonnay 96 does not result from an interaction between the two distinct cell layers L 1 and L 2. If phenotype conformity is further confirmed, somatic embryogenesis will result in <b>true-to-type</b> somaclones of Chardonnay 96 and would be well suitable for gene transfer. </p...|$|E

A {{study was conducted}} to examine the effect of somaclonal variations in in vitro derived cowpea plants under field conditions. The regenerated plantlets were successfully transferred to field after hardening in vitro and grown for collecting R 0, R 1 and R 2 seeds. The seeds of R 1 and R 2 generations were subsequently, grown under field conditions and their various biometrical traits were compared and evaluated with non-tissue cultured cowpea plants as check. There was no detectable somaclonal variation induced in R 0 –R 2 in any of the biometrical traits. The results indicate that the inclusion of different plant growth promoters at specified concentrations and duration in our earlier tissue culture work did not induce any detectable mutation. The RAPD analysis also shows that there is no genetic variation among R 2 cowpea plants. The somatic embryogenesis protocol we report could thus be safely applied for high frequency <b>true-to-type</b> regeneration and transformations protocols without any somaclonal variation...|$|E

The genetic homogeneity was assessed during shoot bud formation from petiole explants of J. curcas (P 1  × P 3) hybrid with different concentrations of thidiazuron (TDZ) in a range of 0. 5 – 4. 0 mg/L using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Out of 23 ISSR primers, 16 primers produced clear, distinct and reproducible bands. A total of 96 bands, ranging in size from 100 to 1013  bp were generated. Based on the band data, a total of 94 bands were monomorphic (98 %) and two bands were polymorphic (2 %). All banding patterns from the shoot buds induced by 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mg/L TDZ were monomorphic, but 4. 0 mg/L gave 2 % polymorphism. These findings indicated that concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mg/L TDZ did not trigger any somaclonal variation and could, therefore, be considered suitable for application in clonal micropropagation of J. curcas hybrid using petioles as explant material...|$|E
