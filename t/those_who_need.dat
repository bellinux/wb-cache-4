5|$|The Government of Canada {{should stand}} ready to {{increase}} Canadian assistance to Sri Lanka in collaboration with other partners, as on-the-ground assessments and capacity to absorb warrant, not only for relief purposes but also for development and reconstruction. In addition to ensuring that assistance reaches <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> it most, the government should pursue a whole-of-government strategy to ensure that Canadian assistance of all sorts encourages longer-term reconciliation among communities in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, is for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> a concrete symbol {{such as a}} Murti, or a visualization aid. They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{people began}} to think that they were too busy to heed every crime and abuse that {{happened}} in their society. They grieved on the rising of evil amongst their people.
