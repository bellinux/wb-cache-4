500|$|Prior to the 2016 {{model year}} the Volt {{required}} premium gasoline of (R+M)/2 octane rating of 91 or higher because the higher octane permitted the 10.5:1 compression ratio engine to utilize more ignition <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> {{in order to}} maximize its fuel efficiency by 5 to 10% as compared to regular gasoline. For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months, the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation, and as a result, the fuel filler has to be depressurized before opening the tank. Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the [...] all-electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system will automatically run the maintenance mode which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine. A configuration with an E85 flex-fuel capable engine is under development and was expected to be available in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{ignition}} systems use {{a mechanical}} spark distributor to distribute a high voltage current {{to the correct}} spark plug at the correct time. In order to set an initial <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> or timing retard for an engine, the engine is allowed to idle and the distributor is adjusted to achieve the best ignition timing for the engine at idle speed. This process is called 'setting the base advance'. There are two methods of increasing <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> past the base advance. The advances achieved by these methods {{are added to the}} base advance number in order to achieve a total <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> number.|$|E

50|$|An {{increasing}} mechanical {{advancement of}} the timing takes place with increasing engine speed. This is possible by using the law of inertia. Weights and springs inside the distributor rotate and affect the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> according to engine speed by altering the angular position of the timing sensor shaft {{with respect to the}} actual engine position. This type of <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> is also referred to as centrifugal <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> The amount of mechanical advance is dependent solely on the speed at which the distributor is rotating. In a 2-stroke engine, this is the same as engine RPM. In a 4-stroke engine, this is half the engine RPM. The relationship between advance in degrees and distributor RPM can be drawn as a simple 2-dimensional graph.|$|E

This is particularly important for fuels like liquefied petroleum gas, which has good capacity for lean combustion. In this study, a fast response NO detector, based on the chemiluminescence method, was used to measure real time NO emissions in order to evaluate the technique as a criterion for establishing combustion occurrence. Test results show that real time NO emissions can be used to identify the cylinder combustion and misfire occurrence during engine cranking, and real time NO emissions can be used to understand the combustion and misfire occurrence.

50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E
50|$|In the GSM system, the {{synchronization}} of {{the mobile}} phones {{is achieved by}} sending <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> commands from the base station which instructs the mobile phone to transmit earlier and by how much. This compensates for the propagation delay resulting from the light speed velocity of radio waves. The mobile phone {{is not allowed to}} transmit for its entire time slot, but there is a guard interval {{at the end of each}} time slot. As the transmission moves into the guard period, the mobile network adjusts the <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> to synchronize the transmission.|$|E
50|$|By {{implementing}} the Extended Range feature, the BTS {{is able to}} receive the uplink signal in two adjacent timeslots instead of one. When the mobile station reaches its maximum <b>timing</b> <b>advance,</b> i.e. maximum range, the BTS expands its hearing window with an internal <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> that gives the necessary time for the mobile to be heard by the BTS even from the extended distance. This extra advance is the duration of a single timeslot, a 156 bit period. This gives roughly 120 km range for a cell. and is implemented in sparsely populated areas and to reach islands for example.|$|E
40|$|Societal {{concerns}} on combustion-based {{fuel consumption}} are ever-increasing. With respect to internal combustion engines, this translates to {{a need to}} increase brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE). Diesel engines are a relatively efficient internal combustion engine to consider for numerous applications, but associated actions to mitigate certain exhaust emissions have generally deteriorated engine efficiency. Conventionally, diesel engine emission control has centered on in-cylinder techniques. Although these continue to hold promise, the industry trend is presently favoring the use of after-treatment devices which create new opportunities to improve the diesel engine's brake fuel conversion efficiency. This study focuses on injection timing effects on the combustion processes, engine efficiency, and the engine system's responses. The engine in the study is a medium duty diesel engine (capable of meeting US EPA Tier III off road emission standards) equipped with common rail direct fuel injection, variable geometry turbo charging, and interfaced with a custom built engine controller. The study found that injection timing greatly affected BFCE by changing the combustion phasing. BFCE would increase up to a maximum then begin to decrease as phasing became less favorable. Combustion phasing would change from being mostly mixing controlled combustion to premixed combustion as injection <b>timing</b> would <b>advance</b> allowing more time for fuel to mix during the ignition delay. Combustion phasing, in turn, would influence many other engine parameters. As injection <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced,</b> in-cylinder temperatures and pressures amplify, and intake and exhaust manifold pressures deteriorate. Rate of heat release and rate of heat transfer increase when injection <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced.</b> Turbocharger speed falls with the <b>advancing</b> injection <b>timing.</b> Torque, however, rose to a maximum then fell off again even though engine speed and fueling rate were held constant between different injection timings. Interestingly, the coefficient of heat transfer changes from a two peak curve to a smooth one peak curve as the injection <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced</b> further. The major conclusion {{of the study is}} that injection advance both positively and negatively influences the diesel engine's response which contributes to the brake fuel conversion efficiency...|$|R

50|$|This {{limited the}} {{original}} {{range of a}} GSM cell site to 35km as mandated by {{the duration of the}} standard timeslots defined in the GSM specification. The maximum distance is given by the maximum time that the signal from the mobile/BTS needs to reach the receiver of the mobile/BTS on time to be successfully heard. At the air interface the delay between the transmission of the downlink (BTS) and the uplink (mobile) has an offset of 3 timeslots. Until now the mobile station has used a <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> to compensate for the propagation delay as the distance to the BTS changes. The <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> values are coded by 6 bits, which gives the theoretical maximum BTS/mobile separation as 35km.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of new combustion concepts {{is to meet}} emission standards by improving fuel air mixing prior to ignition. Since there is no overlap between injection and ignition, combustion is governed mainly by chemical kinetics and {{it is challenging to}} control the phasing of ignition. Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) combustion aims to control combustion phasing by altering the fuel ratios of the high- and low octane fuel and injection timings. In this study the dual fuel blend is prepared with gasoline and diesel fuels. The applied injection timings of the diesel are very early (90 to 60 ° CA bTDC). In the detailed reaction mechanism, n-heptane and iso-octane represent diesel and gasoline fuel, respectively. A multi-zone model approach is implemented to perform RCCI combustion simulation. Ignition characteristics are analyzed by using CA 50 as the main parameter. In the experiments for the early direct injection (DI) <b>timing</b> <b>advancing</b> the injection time results in a later ignition. Qualitatively, the trend effect of the diesel injection timing and the effect of the ratio gasoline/diesel are captured accurately by the multi-zone model...|$|R
50|$|Using a {{knock sensor}} {{to find the}} correct timing is one method used to tune an engine. In this method, the <b>timing</b> is <b>advanced</b> until knock occurs. The timing is then retarded one or two degrees and set there. After {{achieving}} the desired power characteristics for a given engine load/rpm, the spark plugs should be inspected for signs of engine detonation. If there are any such signs, the ignition timing should be retarded until there are none.|$|R
50|$|Performance {{gains are}} {{realized}} {{by adjusting the}} ignition <b>timing</b> <b>advance.</b> Different timing may result in better performance.

50|$|The {{effect can}} be {{considered}} to be analogous to <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> in an internal combustion engine. Generally a dynamo that has been designed to run at a certain fixed speed will have its brushes permanently fixed to align the field for highest efficiency at that speed.|$|E
50|$|In the GSM {{cellular}} mobile phone standard, <b>timing</b> <b>advance</b> value {{corresponds to the}} length of time a signal takes to reach the base station from a mobile phone. GSM uses TDMA technology in the radio interface to share a single frequency between several users, assigning sequential timeslots to the individual users sharing a frequency. Each user transmits periodically for less than one-eighth of the time within one of the eight timeslots. Since the users are at various distances from the base station and radio waves travel at the finite speed of light, the precise arrival-time within the slot can be used by the base station to determine the distance to the mobile phone. The time at which the phone is allowed to transmit a burst of traffic within a timeslot must be adjusted accordingly to prevent collisions with adjacent users. <b>Timing</b> <b>Advance</b> (TA) is the variable controlling this adjustment.|$|E

With an increasing EGR rate, the combustion pressure and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) decreased slightly at BTDC 20 ° compared to other injection timings. However, the Pmax showed a remarkable decrease. The BSFC and PM emissions increased slightly, but the NOx emission decreased considerably...|$|R
