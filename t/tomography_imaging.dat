25|$|Ultrasonographic {{examination}} can {{be useful}} in evaluating questionable asymptomatic kidney tumours and cystic renal lesions if Computed <b>Tomography</b> <b>imaging</b> is inconclusive. This safe and non-invasive radiologic procedure uses high frequency sound waves to generate an interior image of the body on a computer monitor. The image generated by the ultrasound can help diagnose renal cell carcinoma based on the differences of sound reflections on the surface of organs and the abnormal tissue masses. Essentially, ultrasound tests can determine whether the composition of the kidney mass is mainly solid or filled with fluid.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} the renal cell cancer {{detected}} before they have symptoms (incidentally) because of the CT scan (Computed <b>Tomography</b> <b>Imaging)</b> or ultrasound. Incidentally diagnosed renal cell cancer (no symptoms) differs in outlook from those diagnosed after presenting symptoms of renal cell carcinoma or metastasis. The 5 year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly lower stage than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental renal cell carcinoma were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic renal cell carcinoma.|$|E

25|$|Wood and Reavill (2007) {{reviewed}} {{published and}} unpublished data and proposed that aripiprazole may act essentially as a selective D2 receptor partial agonist without significantly affecting {{most of the}} serotonin receptors at therapeutically relevant doses. A positron emission <b>tomography</b> <b>imaging</b> study found that 10 to 30mg/day aripiprazole resulted in 85 to 93% occupancy of the D2 receptor in various brain areas (putamen, caudate, ventral striatum) versus 54 to 60% occupancy of the 5-HT2A receptor and only 16% occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor. It {{has been suggested that}} the low occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor by aripiprazole may have been an erroneous measurement however.|$|E
25|$|In higher plants thylakoids are {{organized}} into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A granum (plural grana) is {{a stack of}} thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or lamellae. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of electron <b>tomography</b> <b>imaging</b> of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed helix is debated.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (latest generation), which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a thin section of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays spins around an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry). Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. Computed tomography has almost completely replaced focal plane tomography in X-ray <b>tomography</b> <b>imaging.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{positron}} emission <b>tomography</b> <b>imaging</b> {{study found}} that single oral 50mg and 100mg doses of tramadol to human volunteers resulted in 34.7% and 50.2% respective mean occupation of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the thalamus. The estimated median effective dose (ED50) for SERT occupancy hence was 98.1mg, which {{was associated with a}} plasma tramadol level of about 330ng/mL (1,300nM). It was also estimated that the maximum daily dosage of tramadol of 400mg (100mg [...] ) would result in as much as 78.7% occupancy of the SERT (in association with a plasma concentration of 1,220ng/mL or 4,632nM). This is close to that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which occupy the SERT by 80% or more.|$|E
2500|$|Peak plasma {{concentrations}} during {{treatment with}} clinical dosages of tramadol {{have generally been}} found to be in the range of 70 to 592ng/mL (266–2,250nM) for tramadol and 55 to 143ng/mL (221–573nM) for desmetramadol. The highest levels of tramadol were observed with the maximum oral daily dosage of 400mg per day divided into one 100mg dose every 6hours (i.e., four 100mg doses evenly spaced out per day). There is some accumulation of tramadol with chronic administration; peak plasma levels of tramadol with the maximum oral daily dosage (100mg [...] ) are about 16% higher and the area-under-the-curve levels 36% higher than following a single oral 100mg dose. Positron emission <b>tomography</b> <b>imaging</b> studies have reportedly found that tramadol levels are at least 4-fold higher in the brain than in plasma. Conversely, brain levels of desmetramadol [...] "only slowly approach those in plasma". The plasma protein binding of tramadol is only 4 to 20%; hence, almost all tramadol in circulation is free and thus bioactive.|$|E
