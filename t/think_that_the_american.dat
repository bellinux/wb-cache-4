60|$|Ithuel looked mystified; for {{he never}} doubted {{in the least}} that the worshipping of images was a {{material}} part of Catholic devotion; and, as for the Pope and the cardinals, he deemed them all as indispensable to the creed of this church, as he fancied it important in his own that the priests should not wear gowns, and that the edifices in which they worshipped should have square-topped windows. Absurd as all this may seem to-day, and wicked as it will probably appear a century hence, it formed, and forms, no small part of sectarian belief, and entered into the animosities and jealousies of those who seem to think it necessary to quarrel {{for the love of}} God. Could we but look back at our own changes of opinion, it would render us less confident of the justice of our sentiments; and, most of all, one would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> who has lived long enough to witness the somersets that have been thrown in the practices and creeds of most of the more modern sects of his own country, within the last quarter of a century, would come to have something like a suitable respect for the more stable and venerable divisions of the Christian world.|$|E

60|$|As {{with the}} skull, {{so with the}} nose; the ancient Huns during the age of Attila were {{accustomed}} to flatten the noses of their infants with bandages, “{{for the sake of}} exaggerating a natural conformation.” With the Tahitians, to be called, long-nose is considered as an insult, and they compress the noses and foreheads of their children for the sake of beauty. So it is with the Malays of Sumatra, the Hottentots, certain Negroes, and the natives of Brazil.[442] The Chinese have by nature unusually small feet;[443] and it is well known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> women of the upper classes distort their feet to make them still smaller. Lastly, Humboldt <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Indians prefer colouring their bodies with red paint in order to exaggerate their natural tint; and until recently European women added to their naturally bright colours by rouge and white cosmetics; but I doubt whether many barbarous nations have had any such intention in painting themselves.|$|R
50|$|Back in the bunker, Neumann {{hears the}} gunfire and ventures {{down into the}} tunnels despite Mirus' protests. Alone, Mirus sees a shadowy figure and takes off in panic. As he flees, he hears {{pounding}} on each consecutive door he closes behind him, {{as if he is}} being pursued. Mirus leaves the bunker and falls outside into the barbed wire. He sees another dark figure approaching and in his panic to escape becomes more and more tangled in the barbed wire. Meanwhile, Neumann, who is searching through the tunnels, is caught by an increasingly paranoid Schenke, who puts a knife to his neck. Neumann regains his trust him and the two return to the artillery ammunition room and booby trap the room to prevent the shells from falling into the hands of <b>the</b> <b>Americans,</b> whom Schenke is sure are stalking through the tunnels. Heydrich, Baumann and Franke decide to blow the bunker door with a stick grenade and fight their way out.

60|$|The {{maintenance}} of slavery was, I think, a political mistake--a political mistake, not because slavery is politically wrong, {{but because the}} politicians of the day made erroneous calculations as to the probability of its termination. So the income tax may be a political blunder with us--not because it is in itself a bad tax, but because those who imposed it conceived that they were imposing it {{for a year or}} two, whereas, now, men do not expect to see the end of it. The {{maintenance of}} slavery was a political mistake; and I cannot <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> in any way lessen the weight of their own error by protesting, as they occasionally do, that slavery was a legacy made over to them from England. They might as well say that traveling in carts without springs, at the rate of three miles an hour, was a legacy made over to them by England. On that matter of traveling they have not been contented with the old habits left to them, but have gone ahead and made railroads. In creating those railways the merit is due to them; and so also is the demerit of maintaining those slaves.|$|R
60|$|This {{assumption}} by {{the government}} of an unconstitutional power has, as I have said, taught many lookers on to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> are indifferent to their liberties. I myself do not believe that such a conclusion would be just. During the present crisis the strong feeling of the people--that feeling which for the moment has been dominant--has been one in favor of the government as against rebellion. There has been a passionate resolution to support the nationality of the nation. Men have felt that they must make individual sacrifices, and that such sacrifices must include a temporary suspension of some of their constitutional rights. But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this temporary suspension is already regarded with jealous eyes; with an increasing jealousy which will have created a reaction against such policy as that which Mr. Seward has attemped, long before the close of Mr. Lincoln's Presidency. I know that it is wrong in a writer to commit himself to prophecies, but I find it impossible to write upon this subject without doing so. As I must express a surmise on this subject, I venture to prophesy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> of <b>the</b> States will soon show that they are not indifferent to the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. On <b>that</b> matter of <b>the</b> illegality of the suspension by the President, I feel in my own mind that there is no doubt.|$|R
50|$|Baumann <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> are in <b>the</b> tunnels. The group then hears movement, {{which turns}} out to be Mirus. The {{soldiers}} turn on a rusty old generator, causing lights to turn on down in the tunnels. Lt. Krupp asks Mirus what's going on but Mirus is evasive. Before the questioning can go any further, the men hear machine gun fire coming from the bunker. When the men arrive, it appears that Neumann, Franke and Schenke had been firing at nothing. Lt. Krupp attempts to call headquarters, but the phone lines are dead. Convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> have entered <b>the</b> tunnels, a game of cat and mouse develops. Stalked by shadowy figures, it becomes increasingly unclear where the men's fantasies end and the danger begins. Krupp agrees to send an expedition to secure the back entrance to the tunnels but on condition that if too much resistance is encountered they return. Mirus and Neumann are left behind in the bunker, while the remaining men split up: Krupp and Schenke in one group and Baumann, Franke and Neumann in the other. Before leaving, Schenke gives a Nazi salute, which none {{of the men in the}} other group return. Neumann stands guard while Mirus scorns the whole idea of trying to fight anymore. Mirus then claims that his son Werner, who died in Normandy, still talks to him and told him something about the tunnels.|$|R

60|$|I {{can never}} insist enough, my dear Cyril, upon <b>the</b> illogicality of <b>American</b> life. You {{know what the}} plutocratic {{principle}} is, and what the plutocratic civilization should logically be. But the plutocratic civilization {{is much better than}} it should logically be, bad as it is; for the personal equation constantly modifies it, and renders it far less dreadful than you would reasonably expect. <b>That</b> is, <b>the</b> potentialities of goodness implanted in the human heart by the Creator forbid the plutocratic man to be what the plutocratic scheme of life implies. He is often merciful, kindly, and generous, as I have told you already, in spite of conditions absolutely egotistical. You would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> would be abashed in view of <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> their morality is often in contravention of their economic principles, but apparently they are not so, and I believe <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> most part they are not aware of the fact. Nevertheless, the fact is there, and you must keep it in mind, if you would conceive of them rightly. You can in no other way account for the contradictions which you will find in my experiences among them; and these are often so bewildering that I have to take myself in hand, from time to time, and ask myself what mad world I have fallen into, and whether, after all, it is not a ridiculous nightmare. I am not sure that, when I return and we talk these things over together, I shall be able to overcome your doubts of my honesty, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when I no longer have them before my eyes I shall begin to doubt my own memory.

5000|$|I have {{a direct}} {{instruction}} from the President to seek better relations with Iraq ... I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is {{that you should have}} the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. I was in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60s another Iraq-Kuwait border conflict. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> issue is not associated with America. James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak. All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly ... Frankly, we can see only that you have deployed massive troops in <b>the</b> south. Normally <b>that</b> would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.

60|$|But {{the very}} {{arguments}} {{which have been}} used to prove <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will be ultimately crushed by the debt, are those which I should use to prove that it will not be crushed. A comparison has more than once been made between the manner in which our debt was made and <b>that</b> in which <b>the</b> debt of the United States is now being created; and the great point raised in our favor is, that while we were borrowing money we were also taxing ourselves, and that we raised as much by taxes as we did by loans. But it is too early in the day to deny to <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>the</b> credit which we thus take to ourselves. We were a tax-paying nation when we commenced those wars which made our great loans necessary, and only went on in that practice which was habitual to us. I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> could have taxed themselves with greater alacrity than they have shown. Let us wait, at any rate, till they shall have had time for the operation, before we blame them for not making it. It is then argued that we in England did not borrow nearly so fast as they have borrowed in <b>the</b> States. <b>That</b> is true. But it must be remembered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dimensions and proportions of wars now are infinitely greater than they were when we began to borrow. Does any one imagine that we would not have borrowed faster, if by faster borrowing we could have closed the war more speedily? Things go faster now than they did then. Borrowing {{for the sake of a}} war may be a bad thing to do, as also it may be a good thing; but if it be done at all, it should be so done as to bring the war to the end with what greatest dispatch may be possible.|$|R

60|$|Mr. K---- was a {{business}} man, well-to-do, well educated, agreeable, and interesting; his house and his table, where we sat down to the mid-day dinner of the country, were witness to his prosperity. I hope it is no harm, {{in the interest of}} statistics, to say that this good Swiss dinner consisted of soup, cold ham put up like sausage, stuffed roast beef which had first been boiled, cauliflower, salad, corn-starch pudding, and apples stewed whole and stuck full of pine pips. There was abundance of the several kinds of excellent wine made upon the estate, both white and red, and it was freely given to the children. Mr. K---- seemed surprised when we refused it for ours; and probably he could have given us good reason for his custom. His boys were strong, robust, handsome fellows; he had a charming pride in showing us the prizes they had taken at school; and on the lawn they were equally proud to show the gymnastic feats they had learned there. I believe we are coming to <b>think</b> now <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> schools are better than the Swiss; but till we have organized something like the Swiss school excursions, and have learned to mix more open air with our instruction, I doubt if the Swiss would agree with us.|$|R

There must, he says, be a lower class, given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature; and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement, and becomes the directing soul of the lower.

60|$|In Boston {{the houses}} are very spacious and excellent, and they are always {{furnished}} with those luxuries which {{it is so difficult}} to introduce into an old house. They have hot and cold water pipes into every room, and baths attached to the bedchambers. It is not only that comfort is increased by such arrangements, but that much labor is saved. In an old English house it will occupy a servant {{the best part of the}} day to carry water up and down for a large family. Everything also is spacious, commodious, and well lighted. I certainly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in house-building <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> have gone beyond us, for even our new houses are not commodious as are theirs. One practice which they have in their cities would hardly suit our limited London spaces. When the body of the house is built, they throw out the dining-room behind. It stands alone, as it were, with no other chamber above it, and removed from the rest of the house. It is consequently behind the double drawing-rooms which form the ground floor, and is approached from them and also from the back of the hall. The second entrance to the dining-room is thus near the top of the kitchen stairs, which no doubt is its proper position. The whole of the upper part of the house is thus kept for the private uses of the family. To me this plan of building recommended itself as being very commodious.|$|R
60|$|Oddly enough, as {{it seems}} to me, he proposes almost cosmic conquests for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Constitution, while leaving out the most {{successful}} thing in <b>that</b> Constitution. <b>The</b> point appeared in answer to a question which many, like myself, must have put in this matter; the question of despotism and democracy. I cannot understand any democrat not seeing the danger of so distant and indirect a system of government. It is hard enough anywhere to get representatives to represent. It is hard enough to get a little town council to fulfil the wishes of a little town, even when the townsmen meet the town councillors every day in the street, and could kick them down the street if they liked. What the same town councillors would be like if they were ruling all their fellow-creatures from the North Pole or the New Jerusalem, is a vision of Oriental despotism beyond the towering fancies of Tamberlane. This difficulty in all representative government is felt everywhere, and not least in America. But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if there is one truth apparent in such a choice of evils, it is that monarchy is at least better than oligarchy; and that where we have to act on a large scale, the most genuine popularity can gather round a particular person like a Pope or a President of the United States, or even a dictator like Caesar or Napoleon, rather than round a more or less corrupt committee which can only be defined as an obscure oligarchy. And in that sense any oligarchy is obscure. For people to continue to trust twenty-seven men it is necessary, as a preliminary formality, that people should have heard of them. And there are no twenty-seven men of whom everybody has heard as everybody in France had heard of Napoleon, as all Catholics have heard of the Pope or all Americans have heard of the President. I think the mass of ordinary Americans do really elect their President; and even where they cannot control him at least they watch him, and in the long run they judge him. I <b>think,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Constitution has a real popular institution in the Presidency. But Mr. Wells would appear to want <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Constitution without <b>the</b> Presidency. If I understand his words rightly, he seems to want the great democracy without its popular institution. Alluding to this danger, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> World State might be a world tyranny, he seems to take tyranny entirely in the sense of autocracy. He asks whether the President of the World State would not be rather too tremendous a person, and seems to suggest in answer that there need not even be any such person. He seems to imply <b>that</b> <b>the</b> committee controlling the planet could meet almost without any one in the chair, certainly without any one on the throne. I cannot imagine anything more manifestly made to be a tyranny than such an acephalous aristocracy. But while Mr. Wells's decision seems to me strange, his reason for it seems to me still more extraordinary.|$|R

[...] Samantha Power, 2004. Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In a review for The New York Times, current U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing <b>that</b> Chomsky divides <b>the</b> world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, who can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of <b>the</b> oppressed. Arguing <b>that</b> he completely ignores <b>the</b> concept <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book is not easy to read, and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomskys [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksys analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administrations standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?". [...] "And it is essential to demand, as Chomsky does, that a country with the might of the United States stop being so selective in applying its principles. We will not allow our sovereignty to be infringed by international treaty commitments in the areas of human rights or even arms control, but we demand that others should. We rebuff the complaints of foreigners about the 650 people who remain holed up in Guantánamo kennels, denied access to lawyers and family members, with not even their names released. Yet we expect others to take heed of our protests about due process. We have official enemies -- those whose police abuses, arms shipments and electoral thefts we eagerly expose (Zimbabwe, Burma, North Korea, Iran). But the sins of our allies in the war on terror (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, Uzbekistan) are met with intentional ignorance." [...] Samantha Power, 2004.
