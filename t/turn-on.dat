25|$|The {{response}} {{time of the}} MOV is not standardized.

That response time is also qualified as insignificant when compared to a transient having an 8µs rise-time, thereby allowing ample time for the device to slowly <b>turn-on.</b> When subjected to a very fast, <1 ns rise-time transient, response times for the MOV are in the 40–60nbsp&ns range.|$|E
25|$|Some thyratrons {{can carry}} large {{currents}} for their physical size. One {{example is the}} miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s jukeboxes as control switches for relays. A cold-cathode version of the thyratron, which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an ignitron; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their <b>turn-on</b> pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern silicon-controlled rectifiers, also called thyristors due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Hydrogen thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters.|$|E

2500|$|Higher {{subthreshold}} conduction: As MOSFET geometries shrink, {{the voltage}} {{that can be}} applied to the gate must be reduced to maintain reliability. To maintain performance, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET has to be reduced as well. As threshold voltage is reduced, the transistor cannot be switched from complete turn-off to complete <b>turn-on</b> with the limited voltage swing available; the circuit design is a compromise between strong current in the [...] "on" [...] case and low current in the [...] "off" [...] case, and the application determines whether to favor one over the other. Subthreshold leakage (including subthreshold conduction, gate-oxide leakage and reverse-biased junction leakage), which was ignored in the past, now can consume upwards of half of the total power consumption of modern high-performance VLSI chips.|$|E

2500|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has also}} been massive growth in {{interest}} in the development of other forms of thin-film emitter, both those based on other carbon forms (such as [...] "carbon nanowalls [...] ") and on various forms of wide-band-gap semiconductor. A particular aim is to develop [...] "high-γ" [...] nanostructures with a sufficiently high density of individual emission sites. Thin films of nanotubes in form of nanotube webs are also used for development of field emission electrodes,. It is shown that by fine-tuning the fabrication parameters, these webs can achieve an optimum density of individual emission sites Double-layered electrodes made by deposition of two layers of these webs with perpendicular alignment towards each other are shown to be able to lower the <b>turn-on</b> electric field (electric field required for achieving an emission current of 10 μA/cm2) down to 0.3 V/μm and provide a stable field emission performance.|$|E
2500|$|With {{some other}} types of {{semiconductor}} device such as the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), both <b>turn-on</b> and turn-off can be controlled, giving a second degree of freedom. As a result, IGBTs {{can be used to}} make self-commutated converters. In such converters, the polarity of DC voltage is usually fixed and the DC voltage, being smoothed by a large capacitance, can be considered constant. [...] For this reason, an HVDC converter using IGBTs is usually referred to as a voltage-source converter (or voltage-sourced converter). [...] The additional controllability gives many advantages, notably the ability to switch the IGBTs on and off many times per cycle in order to improve the harmonic performance, and the fact that (being self-commutated) the converter no longer relies on synchronous machines in the AC system for its operation. [...] A voltage-sourced converter can therefore feed power to an AC network consisting only of passive loads, something which is impossible with LCC HVDC. Voltage-source converters are also considerably more compact than line-commutated converters (mainly because much less harmonic filtering is needed) and are preferable to line-commutated converters in locations where space is at a premium, for example on offshore platforms.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} over the Darlington pair is that the base <b>turn-on</b> voltage is only about 0.6V or half of the Darlington's 1.2V nominal <b>turn-on</b> voltage. Like the Darlington, it can saturate only to 0.6V, which is a drawback for high-power stages.|$|E
40|$|The {{surge of}} mass from one {{component}} of a binary system resulting from local surface heating is analyzed.

As an example, model calculations have been performed for a surge, triggered by a relatively moderate local heating, in a hypothetical X-ray binary; the results show that such a surge can account for X-ray <b>turn-ons...</b>|$|R

50|$|Because <b>turn-ons</b> {{are caused}} by {{internal}} capacitive currents flowing into the gate {{as a consequence of}} a high dv/dt, (i.e., rapid voltage change) a gate resistor or capacitor (or both in parallel) may be connected between the gate and MT1 to provide a low-impedance path to MT1 and further prevent false triggering. This, however, increases the required trigger current or adds latency due to capacitor charging. On the other hand, a resistor between the gate and MT1 helps draw leakage currents out of the device, thus improving the performance of the TRIAC at high temperature, where the maximum allowed dv/dt is lower. Values of resistors less than 1kΩ and capacitors of 100nF are generally suitable for this purpose, although the fine-tuning should be done on the particular device model.|$|R
