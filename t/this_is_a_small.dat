5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E

25|$|Stopper: Also {{called a}} magic post, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pole most often found {{centered}} between and {{just below the}} lowest set of flippers and also rarely next to the outlanes. When activated (typically by hitting a specific target or targets), the pole ascends from inside the machine, blocking the area between the flippers for a limited time, {{making it more difficult}} to drain and lose the ball.

25|$|From 1696 to 1700, {{only about}} 250 {{separate}} items were issued {{from the major}} printing presses in the American colonies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number compared to {{the output of the}} printers in London at the time. London printers published materials written by New England authors, so the body of American literature was larger than what was published in North America. However, printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England. In England, restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations, where the government could monitor what was published: London, York, Oxford, and Cambridge. Because of this, the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{group of}} Towns which were {{established}} to facilitate {{trading on the}} existing frontiers of the Holy Roman Empire or between the Margraves of its marches.

An example is Wiener Neustadt, {{one of the earliest}} towns in present-day Austria to have been granted Stadtrecht, a new town laid out after 1192 by the Babenberg Duke Leopold V of Austria, following his acquisition of the Duchy of Styria. Silver paid in 1194 from the ransom of Richard the Lionhart was used to finance the building of the walls. The defences of Wiener Neustadt are rectangular, measuring 600 by 680 metres. Granted a charter in 1210 the town lies on the historic boundary between the Duchy of Styria and Hungarian Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The {{union of}} the two states proved {{problematic}} early on when in a referendum held on 20 June 1961 to approve the provisional constitution that would govern the two ex-colonial territories was rejected by half {{of the population in}} the Somaliland (the north-west of nascent Somali Republic), the major cities of the former British protectorate voted against the ratification of the constitution - Hargeisa (72%), Berbera (69%), Burao (66%) and Erigavo (69%) - all returned negative votes. This was in contrast to the south (ex-Italian colony) which returned a strong support for the constitution (and four times the expected vote numbers in the south, indicating electoral fraud, an example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> southern village called Wanla Weyn registered a yes vote higher than the 100,000 votes counted in all of the north), this was major signal of discontent coming from the north only a year after forming the union. Another example of the simmering discontent in the north was a coup attempt by northern officers that was thwarted in 1961.|$|E

This isolated the timekeeping element from the varying mainspring force.|$|R
