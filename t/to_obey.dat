5|$|After {{the admiral}} departed, {{the men were}} ordered to {{separate}} themselves into two groups, one for those willing <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> all orders and one for those not willing. To a man, Division Eight chose <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> all orders. Divisions Two and Four were split by the decisions of their men: Small and 43 others chose to form a group unwilling <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> every order. These 44 were taken back to the brig and the remaining 214 were sent to barracks. On the morning of August 12, six men from Divisions Two and Four who had put themselves in the obey-all-orders group {{failed to show up}} for work call; these six were confined to the brig, making 50 prisoners in all. These 50 were identified by the Navy as mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond I died in Apulia in 1111. Bohemond II {{was still}} a minor, so his mother {{took charge of the}} {{government}} of Taranto. The Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent envoys to Tancred to demand control of Antioch, but Tancred refused <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> and continued to govern the principality. Tancred died in 1112 and bequeathed Antioch to his sister's son, Roger of Salerno.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to personality factors, participants who are resistant <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> authority had {{high levels of}} social intelligence.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Verloc, {{the free}} {{woman who had}} had really no idea {{where she was going}} <b>to,</b> <b>obeyed</b> the {{suggestion}} with rigid steadiness.|$|R
5|$|In 1933, Machen {{and other}} conservatives founded the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. A year later, the General Assembly {{declared}} the Independent Board unconstitutional {{and demanded that}} all church members cut ties with it. Machen refused <b>to</b> <b>obey,</b> and his ordination was suspended in 1936. Afterwards, Machen led an exodus of conservatives to form what would be later known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to Cyprus {{with the}} 1st Battalion was Billy's first overseas posting, and despite being ordered {{to keep in}} line, he refused <b>to</b> <b>obey.</b> He failed to keep in step, and tried to headbutt a drummer. The goat major, Lance Corporal Dai Davies, 22, from Neath, South Wales, was unable to keep him under control.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{believed}} that the state governed with divine sanction. He {{believed that}} both {{the church and the}} state are placed under the sovereign rule of God. Christians were obliged <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> the government, but civil disobedience was allowed if the authorities acted against the will of God. He described a preference for an aristocracy over monarchic or democratic rule.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen, {{you have}} heard the order, and my duty is ended. As <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> it or not, you will do as you think fit.' And he turned to leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can bet she does!" [...] Seth exclaimed {{with great}} emphasis; {{and then he}} gave all his {{attention}} <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> the many commands which issued from Mrs. Dean's mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're goin' {{to search}} us, an' {{it may be}} I'll have an invite to stop aboard quite a spell." [...] Darius said half {{to himself as he}} swung the pungy around preparatory <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> orders.|$|R
5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> {{the laws of}} quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also {{swearing}} <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts {{enabled him to}} withstand the attempts of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} {{to push for}} an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E

50|$|Back at the prison, Merle (Michael Rooker) wants {{revenge and}} is fearful for his brother. He argues to preemptively attack The Governor at the meeting, {{but the others}} are {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> Rick's orders and stay put, fearful of potential casualties.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am corrected," [...] he said. [...] "In any case, {{a mystery}} remains as well worth solving.

5|$|Asser's Life omits {{any mention}} of {{internal}} strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he {{makes it clear that}} Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> Agrippa.|$|E
5|$|However, Ladislaus {{could not}} restore royal power in Hungary. A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus {{consolidate}} his authority, but the prelate {{was shocked at}} the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary. Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> the legate's demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans {{to submit to the}} legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.|$|E
5000|$|... "Unless {{and until}} either the General Assembly repeals or suspends the Marriage Law {{provisions}} or {{a court of}} competent jurisdiction orders that the law is not <b>to</b> be <b>obeyed</b> or enforced, the Marriage Law in its entirety is <b>to</b> be <b>obeyed</b> and enforced by all Commonwealth public officials." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've done well, lads," [...] the {{commodore}} said approvingly, {{while he}} moved to and fro {{in front of us}} to make certain that we were all there.

50|$|Generalization of {{symmetrical}} distributions (like {{the normal}} and the logistic) makes them applicable <b>to</b> data <b>obeying</b> a distribution that is skewed {{to the right}} (using an exponent <1) as well as <b>to</b> data <b>obeying</b> a distribution that is skewed to the left (using an exponent >1). This enhances the versatility of symmetrical distributions.|$|R
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In ecclesiastical affairs, Hugh {{attended}} the 1163 Council of Tours {{that was held}} by Pope Alexander III. In 1179 he {{attended the}} Lateran Council at Rome. It was {{while he was there}} that he became involved in the conflict between the king of Scots and the chapter of St Andrews over the election of the bishop of St Andrews. The king wanted his chaplain, another Hugh, and the chapter wanted John the Scot. The pope ordered Puiset to compel the king <b>to</b> <b>obey,</b> but in 1183 the controversy was solved by a compromise.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
6000|$|She {{refused to}} {{recognize}} anything but meaningless badinage in his words. [...] "Oh, as a soldier, yes!--you {{must be used}} <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> orders." [...] He did not reply, and she added, releasing her hand and slipping it into his arm, [...] "I am tired now; will you {{take me back to}} the princess?" ...|$|R
25|$|Raoult's law {{predicts the}} vapor {{pressures}} of ideal mixtures {{as a function}} of composition ratio. In general only mixtures of chemically similar solvents, such as n-hexane with n-heptane, form nearly ideal mixtures that come close <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> Raoult's law. Solvent combinations that can form azeotropes are always nonideal, and as such they deviate from Raoult's law.|$|R
5000|$|Lola, Marchioness dUrgel. Lola {{comes from}} the side streets of Paris. She used to dance [...] "on a tightrope not to be beaten" [...] before she was taken away by Robert. The {{relations}} between them are not unclear. They are not in love: Robert treats Lola almost like a slave and Lola is used <b>to</b> <b>obeying</b> him.|$|R
5|$|Louis {{assembled}} his armies in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365. According a royal charter that year, he {{was planning}} to invade Wallachia because the new voivode, Vladislav Vlaicu, had refused <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> him. However, he ended up heading a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir, which suggests that Vladislav Vlaicu had in the meantime yielded to him. Louis seized Vidin and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June. Within three months, his troops occupied Ivan Stratsimir's realm, which was organized into a separate border province, or banate, under the command of Hungarian lords.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an annoyed Kersh tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that he is}} {{lifting the}} {{quarantine}} of the oil platform. Scully opposes the idea but she has no choice other than <b>to</b> <b>obey.</b> Scully then realizes that de la Cruz is immune to the black oil, and because of it, he suffered from radiation burns instead of infection. After talking to Garza, Doggett leaves to find Mulder but is attacked by Taylor. Mulder arrives and overpowers Taylor, and Mulder and Doggett barricade themselves in the communication room, and try to relay a message while the platform's crew attack the door.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an amphibious {{operation}} at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. The American troops began to flee {{at the sight of the}} enemy, and even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused <b>to</b> <b>obey</b> orders and continued to flee.|$|E
