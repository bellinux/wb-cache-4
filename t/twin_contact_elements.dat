The _ 2 SFH of these solid tori forms a "categorification of Pascal's triangle", and contact structures correspond bijectively to chord diagrams, or sets of disjoint properly embedded arcs in the disc. Their <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> are distinct and form distinguished subsets of SFH of order given by the Narayana numbers. We find natural "creation and annihilation operators" which allow us to define a QFT-type basis of SFH, consisting of <b>contact</b> <b>elements.</b> Sutured Floer homology in this case reduces to the combinatorics of chord diagrams. We prove that <b>contact</b> <b>elements</b> are in bijective correspondence with comparable pairs of basis elements with respect to a certain partial order. The algebraic and combinatorial structures in this description have intrinsic contact-topological meaning. In particular, the QFT-basis of SFH and its partial order have a natural interpretation in pure contact topology, related to the contact category of a disc: the partial order enables us to tell when the sutured solid cylinder obtained by "stacking" two chord diagrams has a tight contact structure. This leads us to extend Honda's notion of contact category to a "bounded" contact category, containing chord diagrams and contact structures which occur within a given contact solid cylinder. We compute this bounded contact category in certain cases. Moreover, the decomposition of a <b>contact</b> <b>element</b> into basis elements naturally gives a triple of contact structures on solid cylinders which we regard as a type of "distinguished triangle" in the contact category.
