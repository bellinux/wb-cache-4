25|$|Within {{the society}} functioned a secret chamber, called Camara Reina, which was {{presided over by}} Bonifacio, Jacinto, and Pío Valenzuela. <b>This</b> <b>mysterious</b> chamber passed {{judgment}} upon those who had betrayed their oath and those accused of certain offenses penalized by Katipunan laws.

25|$|Simultaneously Elizabeth had {{conveyed}} to Louis XV a confidential letter {{in which she}} proposed the signature of a new treaty of alliance of a more comprehensive and explicit nature than the preceding treaties between the two powers without the knowledge of Austria. Elizabeth's object in <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> negotiation {{seems to have been}} to reconcile France and Great Britain, in return for which signal service France was to throw all her forces into the German war. This project, which lacked neither ability nor audacity, foundered upon Louis XV's invincible jealousy of the growth of Russian influence in eastern Europe and his fear of offending the Porte. It was finally arranged by the allies that their envoys at Paris should fix the date for the assembling of a peace congress, and that, in the meantime, the war against Prussia should be vigorously prosecuted. In 1760 a Russian flying column briefly occupied Berlin. Russian victories placed Prussia in serious danger.|$|E

25|$|In {{the tomb}} of Xin Zhui, four coffins of {{decreasing}} sizes enclosed one another. The first and outermost coffin is painted black, the color of death and the underworld. All painted images sealed inside this coffin were thus designed not for an outside viewer but for the deceased and concern the themes of death and rebirth, protection in the afterlife, and immortality. The second coffin has a black background but is painted with a pattern of stylized clouds and with protective deities and auspicious animals roaming an empty universe. A tiny figure, the deceased woman, is emerging at the bottom center of the head end. Only her upper body is shown, for {{she is about to}} enter <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> world. The third coffin exhibits a different color scheme and iconography. It is shining red, the color of immortality, and the decorative motifs include divine animals and a winged immortal flanking three-peaked Mount Kunlun, which is a prime symbol of eternal happiness. Inside this tomb on top of the fourth and innermost coffin the excavators found a painted silk banner about two meters long.|$|E
500|$|The jocular mood of {{the gunmen}} {{abruptly}} ceased. At no time did this new soldier speak {{to any of the}} band members nor did he directly address Crozier. He relayed all his instructions to the gunman in command. Travers, the band's new bass player, assumed he was a British Army officer, an opinion shared by McCoy. Just after the arrival of <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> soldier, McCoy nudged Travers, who was standing beside him, and reassured him by saying [...] "Don't worry Stephen, this is British Army". Travers thought that McCoy, a Protestant from Northern Ireland, was familiar with security checkpoints and had reckoned the regular British Army would be more efficient than the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), who had a reputation for unprofessional and unpredictable behaviour, especially towards people from the Republic.|$|E
500|$|Mounseer Nongtongpaw {{is based}} on a popular 1796 song of the same name by the {{entertainer}} Charles Dibdin. Dibdin's original song mocks English and French stereotypes in five eight-line stanzas, particularly [...] "John Bull's" [...] refusal to learn French. John Bull makes numerous inquiries to which he always receives the same response: [...] "Monsieur, je vous n'entends pas" [...] ("Monsieur, I don't understand you"), which he mistakenly interprets as [...] "Mounseer Nongtongpaw". He comes to believe that the Palais Royal, Versailles, and a beautiful womanthe sights he sees while touring Francebelong to <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> personage. When he comes upon a funeral and receives the same response, he concludes that all of Nongtongpaw's wealth could not save him from death. Mounseer Nongtongpaw expands Dibdin's comic verses, adding more events to the narrative in shorter four-line stanzas, such as inquiries about a tavern feast, a shepherd's flock, a coach and four, and a hot-air balloon: ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{suggestion}} box scene, Larry Wilmore envisioned Dwight as an Ed McMahon-type character, repeating everything Michael said. Paul Lieberstein claimed that {{figuring out the}} logistics for the conference room scene was [...] "the heart" [...] of the episode. Hardin recalled that it was extremely difficult to stay in character, due to the humorous nature of the dialogue and the cast members' reactions. In fact, the cast broke more than usual during filming. During the scene, Michael reads a suggestion from someone named Tom, who asks for better help for people with depression. After inquiring who <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> Tom is, Phyllis tells Michael that he worked in accounting several years ago and committed suicide. Wilmore claimed during the DVD commentary for the episode that the writers would be bringing {{him back in the}} show's third season, in which his backstory would be explained, although this never panned out. However, during the Writer's Block Q session at The Office Convention in 2007, the writers, perhaps sardonically, suggested that Tom's death was the reason that Ryan was brought in as a temporary worker. Tom's name is briefly seen on Dwight's organization chart in the fourth season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?", where his name is revealed to be Tom Peets.|$|E
500|$|On 20January another séance was held, {{this time}} {{at the home of}} a Mr Bruin, on the corner of nearby Hosier Lane. [...] Among those {{attending}} was a man [...] "extremely desirous of detecting the fraud, and discovering the truth of <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> affair", who later sent his account of the night to the London Chronicle. [...] He arrived with a small party which included James Penn of St Ann's in Aldersgate. [...] Inside the house, a member of the group positioned himself against the bed, but was asked by one of the ghost's sympathisers to move. [...] He refused, and following a brief argument the ghost's supporters left. [...] The gentleman then asked if Parsons would allow his daughter to be moved to a room at his house, but was refused. [...] For the remainder of the night the ghost made no sound, while Elizabeth Parsons, now extremely agitated, displayed signs of convulsions. [...] When questioned she confirmed that she had seen the ghost, but that she was not frightened by it. [...] At that point several of the party left, but at about 7am the next morning the knocking once more recommenced. [...] Following the usual questions about the cause of Fanny's death and who was responsible, the interrogation turned to her body, which lay in the vaults of St John's.|$|E
500|$|Around 3:00am on 12 January 1964, 600–800 poorly armed, mainly African insurgents, {{aided by}} some of the {{recently}} dismissed ex-policemen, attacked Unguja's police stations, both of its police armouries, and the radio station. The attackers had no arms, being equipped only with spears, knives, machetes, and tire irons, having only the advantage of numbers and surprise. The Arab police replacements had received almost no training and, despite responding with a mobile force, were soon overcome. Okello himself led the attack on the Ziwani police HQ, which also happened to be the largest armory on the island. Several of the rebels were shot down, but the police were overwhelmed by sheer numbers, with Okello impressing his men with his courage by personally attacking a police sentry and having wrestled his rifle from him, used it to bayonet the policeman to death. [...] Arming themselves with hundreds of captured automatic rifles, submachine guns and Bren guns, the insurgents took control of strategic buildings in the capital, Zanzibar Town. At about 7:00 am, Okello made his first radio broadcast from a local radio station his followers had captured two hours earlier, calling upon the Africans to rise up and overthrow the [...] "imperialists". At the time, Okello only referred to himself as [...] "the field marshal", which prompted much speculation on Zanzibar about just who was <b>this</b> <b>mysterious</b> figure leading the revolution who spoke his Swahili with a thick Acholi accent, which sounded very strange on Zanzibar. Within six hours of the outbreak of hostilities, the town's telegraph office and main government buildings were under revolutionary control, and the island's only airstrip was captured at 2:18pm. In the countryside, fighting had erupted between the Manga as the rural Arabs were called, and the Africans. The Manga were armed with their hunting rifles, and once the arms seized from the police stations reached the rebels in the countryside, the Manga were doomed. In Stone Town, the most fiercest resistance was at the Malindi police station, where under the command of Police Commissioner J.M Sullivan (a British policeman who stayed on until a local replacement could be hired), all of the rebel attacks were repulsed, not least because the insurgents tended to retreat whenever they came under fire. Sullivan only surrendered the Melindi station late in the afternoon after running out of ammunition, and marched his entire force (not one policeman had been killed or wounded) down to the Stonetown wharf to board some boats that took them out to a ship, the Salama to take them away from Zanzibar. Throughout Stone Town, shops and homes owned by Arabs and South Asians had been looted while numerous Arab and South Asian women were gang-raped. The Sultan, together with Prime Minister Muhammad Shamte Hamadi and members of the cabinet, fled the island on the royal yacht Seyyid Khalifa, and the Sultan's palace and other property was seized by the revolutionary government. At least 80 people were killed and 200 injured, the majority of whom were Arabs, during the 12 hours of street fighting that followed. Sixty-one American citizens, including 16 men staffing a NASA satellite tracking station, sought sanctuary in the English Club in Zanzibar Town, and four US journalists were detained by the island's new government.|$|E
