5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered <b>twist</b> <b>drills,</b> self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E

40|$|Drilling is {{involved}} in many applications of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite. <b>Twist</b> <b>drilling</b> is widely used in industry. Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) has been successfully tested to drill holes in CFRP. However, there are no reports on comparisons between RUM and <b>twist</b> <b>drilling</b> of CFRP. This paper compares RUM and <b>twist</b> <b>drilling</b> of CFRP in six aspects (cutting force, torque, surface roughness, delamination, tool life, and material remove rate).

40|$|Abstract. <b>Twist</b> <b>drill</b> {{is widely}} used in hole-making process in industries, due their low {{production}} cost and ease of regrinding after wear. However, drilling of fiber reinforced plastics with <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> often results in defects and damages, such as delamination, debonding, spalling and fiber pullout. The chisel edge of <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> is the mainly influence for the thrust force and the hole quality in drilling carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. Pre-drilled pilot hole or reduce chisel edge can eliminate the threat for <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> in drilling induced-delamination. Drilling-induced thrust force was selected as quality character factors to optimize the drilling parameters (drill type, feed rate and spindle speed) to get the smaller the better machining characteristics by Taguchi method. The {{results show that the}} feed rate and drill type are the most significant factor affecting the induced-thrust in drilling CFRP laminates...|$|R

25|$|A <b>twist</b> <b>drill</b> is a {{bit with}} two cut grooves in {{opposite}} sides of a round bar, whereby the twisted bar produces a helical flute in order to drill holes in metal, plastic, or wood.

5000|$|An annular cutter (also {{called as}} core drill, core cutter, broach cutter, Trepanning drill or cup-type cutter) is a hollow, {{multiple}} cutting edges cutting tool used to make/drill holes in ferrous and non-ferrous metals. An annular cutter cuts only an annular groove at {{the periphery of}} the hole and leaves a solid core or slug at the hole center. [...] Annular cutter is a substitute for slower, more expensive and less efficient <b>Twist</b> <b>drills</b> and Hole saws. The function of Annular Cutters is more or less same as a hole saw but differs in geometry and material. Annular cutters are faster, easier and are more accurate than the conventional <b>twist</b> <b>drills</b> or drill bits.|$|E
