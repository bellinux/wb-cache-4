5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused the underside of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. <b>The</b> <b>rear</b> fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{costs of}} <b>rearing</b> young dairy cattle {{are a part}} of the cost of the price of milk, as <b>rearing</b> {{produces}} <b>the</b> future dairy cows. As most dairy farmers are not aware of <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> costs, <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> of dairy replacements often does not get the attention it deserves. Calculating the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> costs throughout <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> process is difficult as the costs are correlated with biological processes, such as variation in growth rate and disease uncertainty. In this study, a calf level simulation model was built to estimate <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> costs and their distribution from 2 weeks of age until first calving in the Netherlands. The uncertainties related to calf diseases (calf scours and bovine respiratory disease) were included, in which both the probabilities of disease and the effects of diseases (growth reduction) differ at different ages. In addition, growth was modeled stochastically and in a detailed manner using a two-phase growth function. The total cost of rearing young dairy cattle was estimated as € 1567 per successfully reared heifer and varied between € 1423 and € 1715. Reducing the age of first calving by 1 month reduced the total cost between 2. 6 % and 5. 7 %. The difference in the average cost of rearing between heifers that calved at 24 months and those calving at 30 months was € 400 per heifer reared. Average rearing costs were especially influenced by labor efficiency and cost of feed. <b>The</b> <b>rearing</b> costs of a heifer that experienced disease at least once (20 % of the simulated heifers) were on average € 95 higher than those of healthy heifers. Hence, for an individual diseased heifer, disease costs can be rather high, while the relative contribution to <b>the</b> average <b>rearing</b> cost for a standard Dutch dairy farm is low (approx. 3 %). Overall, the model developed proved to be a useful tool to investigate the total cost of rearing young dairy cattle, providing insights to dairy farmers with respect to the cost-efficiency of their own rearing managemen...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for buying organic {{products}} is the animal friendly production system. However, due to an undifferentiated marketing, there is no possibility so far for German consumers to purchase a beef product according to <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system of <b>the</b> cattle - except for the possibility to purchase directly from farms. Yet, there is only little research published on the potential of a differentiated marketing approach for beef from animal-friendly rearing systems, such as extensive suckler cow husbandry. The objective of the present paper is to present findings from a project that assessed the potential for a differentiation of <b>rearing</b> systems for <b>the</b> German organic beef market. Results of the study indicate that the price is not of high importance for consumers of organic beef. Consumers tend to prefer an organic production, but also <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system is an important product attribute. Especially if consumers were informed about <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system, consumers preferred beefsteak from a suckler-cow-based rearing. Additionally, ethical values like the protection of the environment and biological diversity seem to be important facets. Organic products should not only focus on the production system, but also differentiate according to <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) to <b>rearing</b> systems in <b>the</b> Mediterranean by fattening or experimental paralarval production, emergence of diseases has become a concern. The most devastating infection of reared octopus stock is the coccidian parasite Aggregata sp. (Apicomplexa: Aggregatidae) that causes weight loss, excitation and behavioral changes, and miliar subcutaneous parasitic cysts. During eight months of experimental fattening of common octopus in the aquaculture facilities of the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries (Split, Croatia), 7 % mortality was attributed to infection by Aggregata sp. Although the detailed life cycle of the genus Aggregata is not yet completely elucidated, it is known that this heteroxenous coccidian uses crustaceans for merogony, which comprise 30 % of the cephalopod’s diet. For the moment, only adequate zooprophylactic measures can prevent the emergence of the infection in <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system. Preventing introduction of adult specimens into <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system is a critical zooprophylactic measure, along with stocking only juvenile cephalopods that are uninfected by the coccidian through the food web in the natural environment and are, thus, unable to introduce the infection into <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> system. <b>The</b> second measure involves avoiding crustaceans in <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> diet...|$|R
