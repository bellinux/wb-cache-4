When Sam found out that his favourite Chinese restaurant was being demolished {{to make way for}} the new Toronto City Hall, Sam offered the restaurant the upstairs of his Sam the <b>Tape</b> <b>Man</b> store as a new location. It served as the venue for many flagship store, franchise, and record industry functions over the years. In the early 1970s, Sam the <b>Tape</b> <b>Man</b> was relocated to the 347 Yonge store and the space rented to an adult bookstore. The restaurant was eventually closed and the building sold and fully renovated into two Asian restaurants.|$|E
5000|$|Stylistically, {{the film}} {{achieves}} a surprisingly {{high degree of}} realism, especially in the trench and battle scenes. The monotony of dying reinforces the oppressive feeling of authenticity. In addition, there are [...] "small" [...] silent scenes, such as when the student almost incidentally observes grave markers being made {{in a range of}} carpentry on the assembly line, or when Karl's mother is reluctant to leave their place in the food queue when they again see her son. But Pabst wanted more than just [...] "Realism" [...] : [...] "I a realist? From my very first movie I have chosen realistic themes, but with the intention resolutely to be a stylist. ... Realism must be a trampoline from which you jump higher and higher; in itself it has no value. The point is to overcome reality. Realism is a means, not an end." [...] (Quoted in : <b>Tape</b> <b>Man</b> / Hembus, p. 21). So it is not through the combat scenes, but the individual stories of four soldiers that Pabst illustrates pacifist sentiment: belief {{in the power of the}} international solidarity of ordinary people. After the Nazis had seized power in 1933, the film was banned because it was considered [...] "a very one-sided and therefore false representation of war" [...] that would jeopardize [...] "the vital interest of the state to affirm, maintain and strengthen the military will of the people" [...] (text of the prohibition application at the German Film Institute).|$|E

5000|$|For {{months leading}} into the ROH return to Chicago there were cryptic {{messages}} on a blog and website of a stable entering ROH that was code named [...] "Project 161". Jimmy Jacobs {{was one of the}} names mentioned who could be behind this along with Adam Pearce and a few other Chicago-based ROH wrestlers. At one point, posts related to Project 161 flooded the ROH message board, but ROH booker Gabe Sapolsky claimed these were actually fans' doing. Many fans noted that an upcoming pay-per-view <b>taping</b> (<b>Man</b> Up) would be the 161st ROH show, and it was no coincidence that the stable stated they would appear at the show.|$|R

CBS presented Idema and the tapes he supplied as reliable.|$|R
5000|$|Poe was {{preoccupied with}} entombment. Many of his {{characters}} have been incarcerated {{in some form}} or other - in coffins, brick walls or under floorboards. We came up with the 'taped' man - a mummy-like figure who is wrapped, not in bandages, but in 2" [...] recording tape. This motif is partially horror-like, as well as being 'entombed', and the 2" [...] tape appropriately suggests that the album is done by a producer in a studio, as opposed to a band recording material they will play on stage. Although the clients were intrigued by this idea they did not desire a pictorial cover but preferred instead a precise graphic representation. The narrow strip of illustration from George Hardie shows a long shadow of the taped man.The booklet (attached {{to the inside of the}} cover) is composed of photos related to the songs, and line drawings which explore the <b>taped</b> <b>man</b> as he thrashes about in his restricted world and strives to unravel himself. The illustrated capital letters continue the idea. The layout and drawings are by Colin Elgie. The sleeve is one of our better attempts at combining photographs and illustration.|$|R

Jacobs announced that the three had formed a stable called The Age of the Fall. The angle was so controversial that ROH decided to remove the footage from the pay-per-view that was being taped at the event.|$|R

Established in Manchester, they performed in pubs and clubs throughout the north of England. Normal had an eccentric delivery style, and at a 1987 poetry convention in Corby performed with a paper bag over his head. Also in the 1980s, Henry Normal had short prose pieces published in small press magazines such as Peace & Freedom. He had a live album released in 1987 by in <b>Tape,</b> Ostrich <b>Man.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For a while, {{the song}} was known as 'Addy' due to a {{technical}} mishap. Ken Caillat, the band's producer, had made the mistake while playing back a take. [...] "We {{were going to do}} some overdubs, and while rewinding the tape, a portable tape oscillator fell on the machine, sending it into free-wheel - the reels were spinning out of control. I jumped on the machine to stop it - and snapped the <b>tape!</b> Oh, <b>man...</b> laughs We listened back and there it was: ‘Oh ‘addy.’ The ‘D’ part of Christine’s vocal was cut off.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} how {{the effects of}} three audiotapes containig different types of social comparison information on the mood of cancer patients depended {{on the level of}} neuroticism. On the procedural <b>tape,</b> a <b>man</b> and woman discussed the process of radiation therapy, on the emotion tape, they focussed on emotional reactions to their illness and treatment, while on the coping tape they focussed on the way they had been coping. A validation study among 115 students showed that the tapes were perceived as they were intended. The main study was conducted among 226 patients who were about to undergo radiation therapy. Compared to patients in the control group, as patients were higher in neuroticism, they reported less negative mood after listening to the procedural and the coping tape. Furthermore, as patients were higher in neuroticism, they reported less negative mood after listening to the coping tape than to the emotion tape. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} focused {{on the effects of}} social {{comparison}} information on subjective understanding of radiation therapy, validation of emotions, and self-efficacy of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The effects of three different audiotapes, containing different kinds of social comparison information, were examined. On the procedural <b>tape</b> a <b>man</b> and woman discussed their illness and radiation treatment, on the emotion tape they focused on the emotional aspects of these issues, and on the coping tape they focused on the way they had been coping. The effects of these tapes were measured on subjective understanding about radiation therapy, validation and recognition of emotions, self-efficacy, and mood. The results indicate positive effects of the tapes, especially of the procedural and the coping tape. These audiotapes increased understanding of radiation therapy, self-efficacy and the feeling of validation of emotions. Therefore, these tapes may be an important supplement to existing patient education information. Possible explanations and practical implications are discussed. ...|$|R
5000|$|Johns {{involved}} a United States Customs drug smuggling investigation in Arizona where Customs officers followed two pickup trucks {{to a remote}} desert airstrip, and set up surveillance.

Johns and another were the pilots, and they were arrested when they landed. The trucks were not searched at the scene. Instead, they were removed to a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) warehouse in Tucson. Three days later, the officers took samples of the marijuana. The district court ordered suppression of the evidence because of the unreasonableness of the delay, and the government appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the search of the vehicles three days later was unreasonable under United States v. Ross (1982).|$|R

50|$|Rita Schiano's novel, Painting the Invisible Man, was {{influenced}} by the 1976 murder of her father. Like Anna Matteo, the character in the story, Schiano was researching the archives of her hometown newspaper for a client when she made a keying error that led to the discovery of thirty-seven articles from the 1990s referencing her father, murdered in 1976. One such headline mentioned FBI surveillance <b>tapes</b> of a <b>man</b> bragging about getting away with murder twenty years before. Written as a contemporary historical fiction rather than as a memoir, Schiano confronted intensely challenging and personal issues and created a compelling story. It was published September 2007 by The Reed Edwards Company.|$|R
