5|$|In {{their new}} form the {{locomotives}} {{were similar in}} outline to the N15 class, though suffered from the expectation amongst crews that they were an improved version of this type. Despite this, their ability to accelerate well was put <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use</b> on cross-country trains between main lines. The class saw service into nationalisation in 1948. All had been withdrawn by 1957, with none preserved.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, Lyon {{initially}} {{served under}} Horatio Gates in upstate New York and Vermont. In {{a version of}} the event later circulated by his political opponents, he was cashiered for cowardice and ordered to carry a wooden sword to represent his shame. In Lyon's version, he and his men were assigned to guard wheat growing in the fields near Jericho, Vermont; unhappy at not being put <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use,</b> he asked to leave Gates' command and join the regiment commanded by Seth Warner. Lyon's conduct was vindicated by both Arthur St. Clair and James Wilkinson.|$|E

5|$|Operation Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project in aerial warfare, initiated in 1966 by the United States Air Force {{to increase the}} ability to accurately strike at night or in adverse weather. During the 1960s the United States military worked hard to interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts {{in the use of}} weather and darkness to conceal their movement, and understanding the superiority of American air power put their skills immediately <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results.|$|E
5|$|Veerangan {{now finds}} himself saddled {{with the role}} of king for more days than he had {{initially}} bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use</b> by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that he}} is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the reliability of}} three commonly used radiological assessments of total hip arthroplasty (THA) using the electronic picture archiving and communications system (PACS). Thirty-three patients were selected at random at a mean of 7. 2 years after THA. The Barrack, Gruen and Hodgkinson evaluations of cementing quality, loosening/radiolucency were graded. Three observers assessed each radiograph (one consultant orthopaedic surgeon, one senior orthopaedic registrar and one senior house officer). Four weeks after the initial assessment, each radiograph was reviewed a second time. The findings indicated that the intra- and inter-observer reliability of the Barrack, Gruen and Hodgkinson methods were questionable. Inter-observer reliability using the Gruen system was poor, using the Barrack system it was moderate <b>to</b> <b>good,</b> and fair <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>using</b> the Hodgkinson assessment. Intra-observer reliability was moderate <b>to</b> <b>good</b> for Barrack assessment, poor <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>using</b> Gruen zone assessments, but <b>good</b> <b>to</b> very <b>good</b> for the Hodgkinson assessment. The use of Barrack, Gruen and Hodgkinson assessments to evaluate femoral and acetabular loosening should be questioned since these exhibit limited inter- and intra-observer reliability on PACS radiographs, but of the three, the Hodgkinson system is the most reliable...|$|R

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1691, {{and a more}} refined one in 1716, he proposed that more accurate calculations could be made using measurements of a transit of Venus, although the next such event was not due until 1761. Halley died in 1742, but in 1761 numerous expeditions were made to {{various parts of the}} world so that precise observations of the transit could be made {{in order to make the}} calculations as described by Halley—an early example of international scientific collaboration. This collaboration was, however, underpinned by competition, the British, for example, being spurred to action only after they heard of French plans from Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. In an attempt to observe the first transit of the pair, astronomers from Britain, Austria and France traveled to destinations around the world, including Siberia, Newfoundland and Madagascar. Most managed to observe at least part of the transit, but successful observations were made in particular by Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason at the Cape of Good Hope. Less successful, at Saint Helena, were Nevil Maskelyne and Robert Waddington, although they put the voyage <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use</b> by trialling the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.|$|E

She renewed her support for a defeat of the Confederacy, and before long she was leading a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal. The marshes and rivers in South Carolina {{were similar to those}} of the Eastern Shore of Maryland; thus her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge among potential enemies were put <b>to</b> <b>good</b> <b>use.</b> Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants.
