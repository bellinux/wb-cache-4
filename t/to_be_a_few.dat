5|$|The {{individual}} apparent magnitudes {{of the two}} component stars {{cannot be}} directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude {{difference between the two}} stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} main {{characters}} in Doom 3. The player assumes {{the role of}} an anonymous space marine corporal who has just arrived on the UAC's Mars base. The player's non-commissioned officer in-charge is Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly, voiced by Neil Ross, who gives the player objectives and advice over the player's radio {{for the first half of}} the game. The antagonist in the story is Dr. Malcolm Betruger, head scientist of the UAC's enigmatic Delta Labs division, who is revealed to be working in collaboration with the forces of Hell to cause the subjugation of humanity. Betruger's demonic voice, provided by Philip L. Clarke, frequently taunts the player as the game progresses. The final two principal characters are Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell. Swann, voiced by Charles Dennis, is a representative of the UAC's board of directors, sent to check up on Betruger's research as well as investigate the rising number of accidents on the Mars base after a request for assistance from a whistleblower. He is almost always accompanied by Campbell, another space marine who acts as Swann's bodyguard and is armed with a BFG 9000. Campbell is voiced by Andy Chanley. Swann and Campbell are often shown in the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> steps ahead of the player, but cannot be reached and directly communicated with until late in the game. The game also incorporates a large host of minor characters who add details to the story or assist the player in certain segments. The player encounters multiple scientists involved in the various research and development programs and archaeological digs through the UAC base, as well as fellow marines and security guards. Civilian employees engaged in bureaucratic work and maintenance workers are also seen.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×gravesii, {{commonly}} known as Graves' spleenwort, is a rare, sterile, hybrid fern, named for Edward Willis Graves (1882–1936). It is formed by the crossing of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) with lobed spleenwort (A.pinnatifidum). It is only found where its parent species are both present; in practice, this proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> scattered sites in the Appalachian Mountains, Shawnee Hills, and Ozarks, reaching perhaps its greatest local abundance around Natural Bridge State Resort Park. Like its parents, it prefers to grow in acid soil in the crevices of sandstone cliffs.|$|E
25|$|A' Mharconaich has a SW-NE orientated summit ridge, {{just over}} a {{kilometre}} long with high points at each end. The NE summit {{is regarded as the}} highest point and this has been confirmed by an Abney Level survey which found the SW top, named Bruach nan Iomairean, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> metres lower. The 1974 edition of Munro's Tables moved the summit to the SW top, possibly in error, but the location reverted to the original summit in 1981. A' Mharconaich throws out two fine steep ridges {{on either side of the}} eastern corrie. The NE ridge descends initially as a steep buttress before easing and continuing for three km to reach the A9 at Balsporran Cottages.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} about the orbit {{can be used to}} predict how much energy (and angular momentum) would be radiated in the form of gravitational waves. As the energy is carried off, the stars should draw closer to each other. This effect is called an inspiral, and it can be observed in the pulsar's signals. The measurements on the Hulse–Taylor system have been carried out over more than 30 years. The change in the orbital period matches the prediction from the gravitational radiation assumed by general relativity to within 0.2 percent. In 1993, Russell Hulse and Joe Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work, which was the first indirect evidence for gravitational waves. The lifetime of this binary system, from the present to merger is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred million years.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it.

There are just going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something.

500|$|The {{concert was}} {{entitled}} [...] "Money Can't Buy" [...] as no tickets were {{made available for}} purchase publicly; only competition winners and guests with invitations were allowed to attend the show. Additionally, Minogue donated two tickets to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). These tickets were auctioned at a charity ball for the society's [...] "Full Stop" [...] campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald found it surprising that Minogue chose to perform in an [...] "intimate" [...] setting as she had chiefly embarked on large arena tours in the past. The newspaper felt it was similar to Madonna's decision to perform at a small show at Brixton Academy, London, in 2000. Before the show, Minogue held a media press conference and discussed the development of Money Can't Buy, saying: [...] "It's been pretty intense. I'm trying to look pretty calm {{but it has been}} an intense few weeks leading up to this. There's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> old , but they're not-very-oldies. We're stepping marginally back in time. It's always difficult choosing which songs to play from the new album and then what's going to work.

2500|$|In 2011, a {{cell phone}} video {{captured}} two dark shapes in the water. A suggested {{explanation is that the}} video shows two logs. Radford analyzed the video for Discovery News and concluded that “The video quality is poor and the camera is shaky, but {{a closer look at the}} 30-second video reveals that, instead of one long object, there are actually two shorter ones, and they seem to be floating next to each other at slightly different angles. There are no humps, nor head, nor form; only two long, darkish, more or less straight forms that appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen feet long. In short, they look a lot like floating logs, which would not be surprising since Lake Okanagan has tens of thousands of logs harvested by the timber industry floating just under the lake's surface." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bunawar tasks him to {{infiltrate}} the underworld befriending Uco, son of Bangun and heir to his criminal empire. Taking on the alias [...] "Yuda," [...] he is told to assault {{the son of}} the politician responsible for putting Uco in prison, so Bunawar can arrest him so he may befriend the incarcerated Uco. What was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months sentence is instead 3 years. A year into his term, a prison riot breaks out in the raining muddy courtyard as several assailants attempt to kill Uco. They were led by Benny, an associate of Uco's who betrays his trust, before Yuda ultimately saves Uco's life. When Yuda is released two years later, Uco picks him up to meet his father, who hires him as gratitude. He quickly proves his value to the crime family, earning their trust through his work under Uco and his father's consigliere Eka.|$|E

The Chief attempted to reach his horse, but before he was able to mount, several of the enemy surrounded him. He died fighting. A Pawnee, who was skinning a buffalo a short distance away but managed to escape, told me how Sky Chief died." ...|$|E
