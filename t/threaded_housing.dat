5000|$|All WPF {{applications}} {{start with}} two threads: one {{for managing the}} UI and another background thread for handling rendering and repainting. Rendering and repainting is managed by WPF itself, without any developer intervention. The UI <b>thread</b> <b>houses</b> the Dispatcher (via an instance of [...] ), which maintains a queue of UI operations {{that need to be}} performed (as a tree of [...] objects), sorted by priority. UI events, including changing a property that affects the layout, and user interaction events raised are queued up in the dispatcher, which invokes the handlers for the events. Microsoft recommends that the event handlers only update the properties to reflect new content for application responsiveness, with the new content being generated or retrieved in a background thread. The render thread picks up a copy of the visual tree and walks the tree calculating which components will be visible and renders them to Direct3D surfaces. The render thread also caches the visual tree, so only changes to the tree need to be communicated, which will result in updating just the changed pixels. WPF supports an extensible layout model. Layout is divided into two phases: Measure; and Arrange. The Measure phase recursively calls all elements and determines the size they will take. In the Arrange phase, the child elements are recursively arranged by their parents, invoking the layout algorithm of the layout module in use.|$|R

There are several [...] "fixes" [...] available in the aftermarket: New, oversized, self-tapping fuel filter inserts; new fuel filter inserts that seal with O-rings; and Heli-Coil re-threading kits. In nearly all cases, the carburetor will require dis-assembly and internal cleaning of the aluminum thread residue, especially up to and including the needle and seat, (needle valve), to prevent flooding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{community}} {{was developed in}} the 1920s as a mill town, a planned community that contained the Dixie Spinning Mills <b>thread</b> mill and <b>housing</b> for its workers. Chattanooga businessman John T. Lupton established the Dixie Mercerizing Company around 1920 to manufacture thread using the mercerizing process, which had been introduced in 1913. The company built its thread-spinning facility and the adjoining housing area on a 1000 acre tract north of the Tennessee River, outside the city limits of Chattanooga. In 1923, when production began, the spinning mill had 12,000 spindles; by 1925 there were 30,000 spindles.|$|R
5000|$|During the Hip-Hop Decathlon Challenge, Quest was {{put into}} the bottom two {{for the first time}} against Fly Khicks. The crew had to {{incorporate}} five styles of hip hop into their routine: <b>threading,</b> krumping, <b>housing,</b> tutting and waving. Hok was familiar with tutting and Ryan Conferido knew how to thread so the crew depended on them to work on those sections. Songs performed in the Hip Hop Decathlon were: Poker Face by Lady Gaga (Threading), Love Lockdown by Kanye West (Tutting), I'm in Miami trick by LMFAO (Waving), Closer by Ne-Yo (Housing), and Get Up by 50 Cent (Krumping). The performance received a standing ovation from the judges and audience. The judges highly praised the crew. D-Trix performed elbow airflares, which received compliments from Shane Sparks, Hirano receiving compliments for being buff - since he ripped his shirt off during the krumping section - and Steve Terada performed a backflip from a sitting Indian-style position. Victor Kim performed threaded handhops, and Hok Konishi choreographed the tutting section. JC praised Hok in his tutting by calling him a true Egyptian and stating that Hok should be called [...] "King Tut".|$|R
50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm bolt cover. It {{is usually a}} piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the <b>threaded</b> counterbore, which <b>houses</b> the bolt that holds the crankarm to its axle, the bottom bracket spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on {{the inside of the}} counterbore), which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle. It is also {{possible}} for the crank arm to squirm on the bottom bracket spindle, causing the crankarm nut/bolt to become loose, leading to the nut/bolt working its way out of the bottom bracket spindle. The dust cap limits the amount of dangerous loosening that can occur.|$|R
2500|$|Conversely, Henry VIII {{embraced the}} new Italianate style. From the later 1520s, the king's {{tapestry}} commissions reflect two marked tendencies: {{a selection of}} themes and subjects chosen as [...] "unambiguous and pointed" [...] propaganda, and the first appearance of the figural styles of the Italian Renaissance in England, albeit through the [...] "distorted lens of the Brussels 'Romanist' artists." [...] In October 1528, Henry acquired a small set of the Twelve Months and a much larger ten-piece set of The Story of David measuring 743 1/2 ells (418 square yards) from the merchant Richard Gresham. [...] Recent research suggests strongly that this set of the Story of David has survived intact and is the Brussels-woven set worked in wool, silk, and metal-wrapped <b>thread</b> now <b>housed</b> in the Musée National de la Renaissance, Écouen, described as [...] "one of the finest examples {{in the world of}} pre-1530 weaving." [...] In the 1540s Henry commissioned Brussels reproductions of the Raphael Acts of the Apostles series and a set of Antiques also woven to designs created for Leo X [...] ca1517–20 by artists of the Raphael workshop. [...] Two of these, The Triumph of Hercules and the Triumph of Bacchus, remain in the Royal Collection and are hung in Hampton Court Palace.|$|R

40|$|Byssus play an {{important}} role in securing bivalve molluscs to their respective substrates. This study investigated the impacts of relative current strength and different culture apparatus on byssus secretion by the black-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera. Oysters were either 'ear-hung or housed in panel nets before being transported to low (Nawi) and high (Raviravi) current sites. The quantity of new byssus produced by oysters in the two culture apparatus at the two sites was counted 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after deployment. At the end of the experiment, the thicknesses and tensile strengths of randomly selected byssal threads from ear-hung oysters and oysters held in panel nets were determined. Ten days after deployment, there was no significant difference in the quantity of byssus produced by oysters in the two culture apparatuses at both sites. An average of around two threads per byssus secreting oyster was recorded by the tenth day. However, after 15 and 20 days, ear-hung oysters had produced significantly more byssus (p < 0. 01) than those housed in panel nets at the high current site. On the twentieth day, ear-hung oysters had an average of six byssal <b>threads</b> while those <b>housed</b> in panel nets had an average of around three per oyster at the Raviravi site. In contrast, production of byssus by oysters in the two culture apparatuses did not differ significantly for the same period at the low current site. Furthermore, ear-hung oysters produced significantly thicker byssus than those held in panel nets (p < 0. 01) which had significantly high tensile strengths (p < 0. 01). We hypothesise that secretion of an increased number of byssal threads by ear-hung oysters is a response to a greater degree of agitation than those held in panel nets...|$|R

5000|$|DataLounge was {{launched}} by Mediapolis, Inc. in May, 1995. During the site's early years, content included gay-oriented news, gossip, {{links to other}} sites/services, and editorial content that made it a gay Web portal. Content contributors included New York drag queen Trudy and journalist Chris Barillas. DataLounge affiliated itself via the DataLounge Network with other web sites such as the gay dating site Edwina.com, gay Web guide Homorama, and gay health information site Gay Health, offering information and services to gays and lesbians. A weekly e-mail was also offered to users. The site evolved to have several discussion forums covering topics such as lesbian, religious and sexual issues, and also created a [...] "Flames and Freaks" [...] forum to <b>house</b> <b>threads</b> that site administrators determined to be disruptive to general forum discussion. Forums created for subpopulations such as The Lord of the Rings fans and U.S. daytime drama aficionados were subsequently closed. The most popular forum was the Gossip Forum, which dwarfed all others in both traffic and number of discussion threads created. A portion of DataLounge and the DataLounge Network's content came {{as a result of}} the integration of some of the 1995-97 content of Out.com from Out Magazine, which announced in March 1997 that it was closing its Web site to focus on print content. Out.com users were redirected to DataLounge, and DataLounge administrators adopted Out.com's discussion forums, dating service, and weekly survey. In 2003, DataLounge instituted a subscription service which blocked all web banner and pop-up advertising for a $12 annual fee (this fee was subsequently raised to $15, then to the present price of $18). In 2005, DataLounge was given a major redesign. All forum topics were collapsed into one general discussion forum called [...] "The DataLounge Forum," [...] and all news content, most references to the other sites in the DataLounge Network, and other features were discontinued. Editorial commentary discussing events continues to appear on the site. Users were also given the option to control aspects of the site's layout, including filtration of political, gossip, and/or [...] "Flames and Freaks" [...] threads. With this redesign came a policy change that limited access to the DataLounge Forum during high-traffic [...] "primetime" [...] periods to fee-paying subscribers. This move was met with controversy amongst DataLounge users, as non-subscribers were blocked from the DataLounge Forum during these periods. Though Mediapolis has received complaints about the policy, specifically that [...] "primetime" [...] periods are irregular and can often occur at times when site traffic should be at its slowest (e.g., North American overnight hours), DataLounge administrators assert that the [...] "primetime" [...] is necessary to prevent slowdowns of the other sites which Mediapolis hosts on the same servers, and preserves the existence of the DataLounge forum by generating revenue to cover DataLounge's hosting, bandwidth and maintenance expenses. In the summer of 2007 DataLounge instituted a policy that only paying members may start new threads, but in May 2009 DataLounge launched another comprehensive redesign of the site, dubbed [...] "V6," [...] one that allows users to embed photos and YouTube videos, as well as mark specific threads to watch. The new site is auto-refreshed in real-time as new posts are written, and nonpaying members were at first permitted to start threads, but that quickly changed. The DataLounge Webmaster explained in introducing the redesigned site that the transition was largely dictated by the effect of tabbed Web browsing, which resulted in users constantly using their browsers' refresh function and overloading the servers, sending the site into constant primetime mode. However, shortly after launching V6, the Webmaster reinstituted primetime, in part due to the quick proliferation of racist troll posts.|$|R
