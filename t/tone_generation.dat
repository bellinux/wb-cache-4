40|$|Results {{of recent}} NASA {{research}} to reduce aircraft turbofan noise are described. As the bypass ratio of a turbofan engine increases from 5 {{to as much}} as 20, the dominant source of engine noise is the fan. A primary mechanism of <b>tone</b> noise <b>generation</b> is the rotor blade wakes interacting with downstream stator vanes. Methods of analyzing rotor-stator <b>tone</b> noise <b>generation</b> are described and sample results are given. The role of an acoustic modal description is emphasized. Wind tunnel tests of model fans and nacelles are described including a novel rotating microphone technique for modal measurement. Sample far field results are given showing the effects of inlet length, and modal measurements are shown which point to a new generation mechanism. Concepts for active fan noise control at the source are addressed. Implications of the research which have general relevance to fan noise generation and control are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Discrete <b>tone</b> sound <b>generation</b> in a subsonic fan {{subject to}} {{three-dimensional}} disturbances is investigated. The analytical model used treats the fan rotor and stator as linear cascades of thin airfoils in a rectangular duct {{subject to a}} three-dimensional gust for which a complete aerodynamic theory already exists. The sound pressure can then be cast as the sum of {{a finite number of}} discrete sound waves (modes) the magnitude of which depends on an unknown function satisfying a singular integral equation. Similarity rules are derived to reduce the problem to that of a two-dimensional gust. Three-dimensional effects on the cut-off condition, the sound pressure, and the acoustic power are first investigated for each mode. The theory is then applied to noise generated by typical rotor-wake-defect and rotor-tip-vortex disturbances interacting with a stator...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese {{language}} is a typical tone language in which a syllable possesses several tone types and thus can represent different morphemes. While these tone types have rather clear manifestations in the fundamental frequency contour in isolated syllables, they vary considerably in connected speech due to the influences of such factors as tones of adjacent syllables, syntactic and pragmatic information of the whole utterance. This paper describes the results of analysis of F 0 contours of the Standard Chinese using a command-response model, and shows that systematic relationships exit between {{the timing of the}} tone commands and the “vowel plus coda ” part of a syllable. The results are then used to derive rules for <b>tone</b> command <b>generation</b> in speech synthesis. The validity of the rules has been confirmed by the naturalness of prosody of synthetic speech. 1...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{programs}} were developed {{for use in}} the analysis of sound generation by subsonic rotors. Program AIRFOIL computes the spectrum of radiated sound from a single airfoil immersed in a laminar flow field. Program ROTOR extends this to a rotating frame, and provides a model for sound generation in subsonic rotors. The program also computes <b>tone</b> sound <b>generation</b> due to steady state forces on the blades. Program TONE uses a moving source analysis to generate a time series for an array of forces moving in a circular path. The resultant time series are than Fourier transformed to render the results in spectral form. Program SDATA is a standard time series analysis package. It reads in two discrete time series and forms auto and cross covariances and normalizes these to form correlations. The program then transforms the covariances to yield auto and cross power spectra by means of a Fourier transformation...|$|R

40|$|A model {{supersonic}} inlet with auxiliary inlet {{doors and}} boundary layer bleeds was acoustically tested in simulated low speed flight up to Mach 0. 2 in the NASA Lewis 9 x 15 Anechoic Wind Tunnel and statically in the NASA Lewis Anechoic Chamber. A JT 8 D refan model {{was used as}} the noise source. Data were also taken for a CTOL inlet and for an annular inlet with simulated centerbody support struts. Inlet operation with open auxiliary doors increased the blade passage tone by about 10 dB relative to the closed door configuration although noise radiation was primarily through the main inlet rather than the doors. Numerous strong spikes in the noise spectra were associated with the bleed system, and were strongly affected by the centerbody location. The supersonic inlet appeared to suppress multiple pure <b>tone</b> (MPT) <b>generation</b> at the fan source.
