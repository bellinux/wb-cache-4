60|$|Mrs. Vivian colored {{more deeply}} {{and glanced at}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr Prosser half turned, then {{thrust his}} head through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Collins {{looked up}} and grunted and looked out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{the third}} four-wheeled cab, where <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>again</b> were wide open, Martin Stone, {{with his hands}} thrust deep {{into the pockets of}} his coat, and his long legs crossed, sat staring at the roof, with a sort of twisted scorn on his pale face.|$|R
60|$|With the {{greatest}} delicacy {{he shifted his}} ground to <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>again,</b> {{and asked if he}} could look at one of them. On Neville’s opening it, he immediately sprang out, as if he were going aloft with a whole watch in an emergency, and were setting a bright example.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mary lurched towards <b>the</b> open <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> {{dropped on}} her knees, {{her head on}} the sill, and lay quiet, {{surrendering}} the cut hand to me.|$|R
60|$|But Will at last {{turned away}} from his {{portfolio}} and approached <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Worthington {{walked to}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> perhaps to compose himself, {{and then came}} back again.|$|E
60|$|She bit {{her lips}} to keep from crying out. She looked out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> seeking control.|$|E
60|$|The sun, {{reaching}} <b>the</b> second <b>window,</b> <b>again</b> shot a gold pathway athwart the church; {{again the}} millions of dust atoms danced, and the service went on.|$|R
2500|$|A new glazing {{pattern was}} introduced. The door and two glazed {{sides of the}} K2 each had 18 equal-sized panes of glass {{arranged}} in 6 rows of 3. In the K6 the number of rows was increased to 8, and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side. This improved visibility, and gave a more horizontal appearance to <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> in keeping with [...] "moderne" [...] principles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better {{have your}} place by <b>the</b> <b>window</b> back <b>again,</b> Miss Thurnbrein," [...] the girl {{at her side}} said suddenly. [...] "You're looking like Clara, just before she popped off. My, ain't it awful!" ...|$|R
60|$|Tom {{ran up to}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> It {{was true}} Baxter and the man with a scar had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused and}} leaned out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> whilst she watched him, breathless and terrified. She was {{beginning}} to understand.|$|E
60|$|The gentleman got up {{and walked}} to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again</b> and back: seriously uneasy, though giving his uneasiness this {{peculiar}} expression.|$|E
60|$|Duncombe {{was silent}} for a moment. He walked restlessly to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and back <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned to}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and <b>again</b> {{looked up into}} the sky. There was a great star up there, and it seemed to wink cheerfully at me as the words came into my mind, [...] "her husband's successor." ...|$|R
50|$|The building's {{office space}} is divided {{according}} to the axis of <b>the</b> outside <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> making use of natural light as much as possible. The interior walls are non-load-bearing, and can therefore be re-arranged according to need, a feature that has become standard in modern office buildings.|$|R
60|$|He sighed faintly, and {{glancing at}} the girl, who was looking out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> took up his pen and signed his blotting-paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Burrows was cremated on Wednesday. It seems she {{preferred}} it to burial." [...] Having said this, {{he turned to}} stare from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{get nothing}} more to eat till night," [...] she said, looking out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Take your hound-dog's face out of the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|More {{than an hour}} passes {{while they}} are thus invisible. The French [...] {{officers}} who have observed the scene from the lodging of NAPOLEON [...] walk about idly, and ever and anon go curiously to <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> [...] <b>again</b> to watch the raft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{content of}} a window is not {{guaranteed}} to be preserved if <b>the</b> <b>window</b> or one of its parts are made not visible. In this case, the application are sent an [...] event when <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of one {{part of it is}} made visible again. The application is then supposed to draw <b>the</b> <b>window</b> content <b>again.</b>|$|R
50|$|After nightfall, he crept out of <b>the</b> bedroom <b>window</b> <b>again</b> {{and stole}} {{down to the}} outbuilding. Finding {{a crack in the}} shutters, he looked in, saw the man he had seen earlier in the day, and another figure who he was sure was Godfrey, {{although}} he could not see him clearly.|$|R
60|$|She {{stared at}} him, {{breathing}} heavily, then {{looked out of}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> At last she turned to him. She seemed to refer to his invitation.|$|E
6000|$|THE hoar-frost {{crumbles}} in the sun, [...] The crisping steam {{of a train}} Melts in the air, {{while two}} black birds [...] Sweep past <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her eyes {{strayed from}} his face back to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> There was no light {{anywhere}} in the house. It had a cold desolate look which chilled her.|$|E
6000|$|... “Daniel! Daniel!” shrieked Mrs. Hawkins, {{still in}} <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> “Come up <b>again!</b> Leo didn’t fasten him tight enough an’ he’s gettin’ away!” ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> {{was raised}} <b>again,</b> and the girl's voice was heard low and tremulous: [...] "Lime, I'm ready, but I wish we didn't"---- ...|$|R
500|$|In {{a larger}} event in 1966 in San Francisco, drag queens, hustlers, and transvestites {{were sitting in}} Compton's Cafeteria when the police arrived to arrest men dressed as women. A riot ensued, with the patrons of the {{cafeteria}} slinging cups, plates, and saucers, and breaking <b>the</b> plexiglass <b>windows</b> in <b>the</b> front of the restaurant, and returning several days later to smash <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>again</b> after they were replaced. Professor Susan Stryker classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an [...] "act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation" [...] and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations. It {{marked the beginning of}} transgender activism in San Francisco.|$|R
60|$|She {{was moving}} towards <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> {{and for all}} that he dared not a second time arrest her by force, he sought by words to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm getting nervous," [...] said Kemp. But it {{was five}} minutes {{before he went to}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "It must have been a sparrow," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Garland {{looked at}} him, smiling intently, {{and went to}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "I expect to enjoy it," [...] she said. [...] "Don't be afraid; I am not wasteful." ...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{there was}} more than one window, with Richard and his wife shown separately, since 1847 the {{remaining}} glass forms one <b>window.</b> <b>The</b> <b>window</b> was restored <b>again</b> in 2012.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he swung}} up {{his chair and}} dashed it at <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and yet <b>again,</b> until no <b>window</b> remained, but a great, gaping opening with a fringe of ragged glass and twisted leadwork.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I must lie {{here like}} a {{bedridden}} monk," [...] exclaimed Ivanhoe, [...] "while {{the game that}} gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of others!--Look from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> once <b>again,</b> kind maiden, but beware {{that you are not}} marked by the archers beneath--Look out once more, and tell me if they yet advance to the storm." ...|$|R
