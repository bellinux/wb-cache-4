5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the <b>towpath</b> as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the <b>towpath</b> from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the <b>towpath</b> diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the <b>towpath.</b> These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E

5|$|Bridgwater Docks, {{in which}} the tidal basin, locks, quaysides, bridges and {{fittings}} are listed buildings, is now a marina, and the old warehouse, built in 184050 has been converted into apartments, with new apartment blocks built nearby. The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal Feed Mill. The <b>towpath</b> forms part of Sustrans' National Cycle Network route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. Plans have been proposed for the upgrading of the <b>towpath</b> and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, when {{unemployment}} rose, the organisation {{took advantage of}} government schemes to provide temporary employment to build similar 'green routes'. British Waterways collaborated with Sustrans to improve <b>towpaths</b> along some canals, which resulted in greatly increased use of the <b>towpaths,</b> especially by cyclists.|$|R

50|$|Google {{partnered with}} the Canal & River Trust {{to include the}} UK’s <b>towpaths</b> on Google Maps. This {{includes}} highlighting access points, bridges, locks and tunnels. Once the project is complete, {{members of the public}} will have the ability to plan journeys that include canal and river <b>towpaths</b> as well as roads.|$|R
5|$|When the First Welland Canal {{was opened}} in 1829, the Niagara Road became a <b>towpath</b> for vessels exiting the Welland River. Oxen {{on the road}} would tow boats against the rapid current of the Niagara River as they exited the canal and {{continued}} south to Lake Erie. In 1833, a large cut was made to connect the canal with Port Colborne, eliminating {{the use of the}} road as a <b>towpath.</b> It continued {{to be used as a}} public road until the government gave the reserve to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1891.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgewater Way is {{a scheme}} to redevelop the canal {{and make it more}} {{accessible}} to users, particularly cyclists. The 40-mile development, which includes a new <b>towpath,</b> will form part of the National Cycle and Footpath Network as Regional Route number 82.|$|E
5|$|The <b>towpath</b> {{under the}} bridge on the {{southern}} bank now forms part of the Thames Path. As at 2009 the northernmost arch {{was used by the}} Tideway Scullers sculling club as storage space.|$|E
50|$|After the Industrial Revolution, towing became {{obsolete}} when engines were fitted on {{boats and}} when railway transportation superseded the slow towing method. Since then, {{many of these}} <b>towpaths</b> have been converted to multi-use trails. They are still named <b>towpaths</b> — although they are now only occasionally used {{for the purpose of}} towing boats.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{extensive}} network of public footpaths and canal <b>towpaths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{historically}} {{not designed}} or used as <b>towpaths,</b> acequia ditch banks also are popular recreational trails.|$|R
5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal at Southcote {{is still}} used for {{pleasure}} boating; moorings for narrowboats are located between Southcote Lock and Burghfield Bridge. The canal is accessible from footpaths near Burghfield Bridge, Southcote Mill and Fobney Lock, and the <b>towpath</b> through Southcote is a designated portion of National Cycle Route 4.|$|E
5|$|The River Don Navigation {{ended at}} Tinsley Wharf, but {{it forms a}} {{convenient}} place to start {{a description of the}} route. The wharf was on the river, just upstream from the present junction with the canal to Sheffield. It was close {{to the site of the}} Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway over the valley of the River Don. From here there is a <b>towpath</b> along the canal to Victoria Quays (formerly Sheffield Basin) in Sheffield City Centre, or the Five Weirs Walk follows the course of the River Don to the same destination. The <b>towpath</b> extends to Rotherham in the opposite direction, passing the large Jordans Weir and the three locks on the Holmes Cut. Beside Jordans Weir is the outfall from Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment plant. In dry weather, this discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{stretch of}} canal from Sharpness to Purton runs {{very close to}} the river. At a high spring tide they were {{separated}} by little more than the width of the <b>towpath.</b> The canal also has no locks, and owing to its width, not even any stop locks. Any damage to the canal bank could thus render the entire canal unnavigable.|$|E

5|$|The <b>towpath</b> {{continues}} to Rotherham Lock, where the Rotherham cut starts, but {{from here to}} Conisbrough, {{the only way to}} see the navigation is from a boat or from one of the bridges which cross it. To the north of the cut are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, {{in the shadow of the}} A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal turns off to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the <b>towpath</b> resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends.|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the <b>towpath</b> from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the top three locks at Woolsthorpe in the 1990s, a 10-mile (16-km) section from the A1 to Redmile will be completed once the bottom four locks of the flight are restored. The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much improvement of the <b>towpath</b> has also taken place, and access to it is possible at most of the bridges.|$|E
50|$|London's canal <b>towpaths</b> provide {{numerous}} walking {{routes and}} connect {{many of the}} capital's famous green spaces, including from Regent's Park to Victoria Park (and then to the River Thames) and from the Lee Valley Regional Park in the east to the Colne Valley Regional Park in the west. The <b>towpaths</b> of the Grand Union Canal with its Paddington and Slough Arms, The Regent's Canal, Hertford Union Canal, Lee Navigation and Limehouse Cut can also be followed.|$|R
5000|$|The Netherton tunnel {{was built}} with a width of 27 ft to allow two-way working of narrowboats; and is brick lined throughout. It has <b>towpaths</b> running through it, {{one on each}} side, which enabled horse-drawn narrowboats to be pulled through it. Chainage (distance) markers are still visible on the Eastern wall. The tunnel was fitted, from the start, with gas {{lighting}} over the <b>towpaths,</b> though this was later converted to electricity {{and it is now}} unlit.|$|R
25|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the canal passes over three cast iron aqueducts, unusual in that the <b>towpaths</b> are {{at the level of}} the canal bottom.|$|R
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet <b>towpath.</b> Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E
5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including {{the building of a}} half-lock and the removal of a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a <b>towpath</b> between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the <b>towpath</b> to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the legality of the action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later passed to the Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E

5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the <b>towpath</b> was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the <b>towpath</b> below Leigh Woods.|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows. They were built of dressed stone, and are the best-preserved of the original hatches. There is no modern sluice at Conegar Lock, and the change in level has resulted in fast-flowing rapids which have cut back the channel above the lock. A little further south at Fish House Bay, the navigation crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made its {{way back to the}} main river. A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the <b>towpath</b> over the Barton River, but the navigation below this point is dry, with its line occupied by a vegetable garden.|$|E
50|$|Factories and {{warehouses}} {{line the}} Cut {{for the initial}} section of the cut above Limehouse Basin, but whereas {{they used to be}} serviced by the canal they are now serviced by roads. Most use of the canals is for pleasure, both on the water and beside the water on the <b>towpaths.</b> Regent's Canal, the Hertford Union Canal, the Lee Navigation and the Limehouse Cut form a four-sided loop, covering a distance of 5.5 mi, which can be walked or cycled. The scenic <b>towpaths</b> cut across roads and railways in the area, providing a distinct viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|The canal {{was built}} in the, then, county of Staffordshire under an Act of Parliament of April 1844 (four years after the merger of the BCN and W&E) to connect the Daw End Branch to The Tame Valley Canal to take coal from Cannock mines to Birmingham and the Black Country. The {{engineer}} was James Walker. It was specified to be 36 ft wide with <b>towpaths</b> on both sides. The <b>towpaths</b> were to be 9 ft wide, but {{only one of them}} (on the west side) was constructed. It was completed 1847.|$|R
50|$|The Way for the Millennium is an east-west route across Staffordshire, {{deliberately}} {{designed for}} easy walking, using <b>towpaths,</b> old railway lines and footpaths and visiting attractive countryside and green spaces.|$|R
