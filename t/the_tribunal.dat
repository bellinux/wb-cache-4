5|$|A {{reference}} must be {{made under}} the hand of (that is, signed by) the President, and must be served on the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is required to assist <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> in the hearing of the reference, and the President may be represented by such legal counsel as <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> may appoint, after consulting the President. The parties appearing before <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> are {{not confined to the}} President and the Attorney-General. <b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, to one or more representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E
5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} member of <b>the</b> <b>tribunal</b> without a vote, {{his voice was}} heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with <b>the</b> <b>tribunal,</b> member or otherwise, had a greater part than he in shaping the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of <b>the</b> <b>tribunal</b> will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{intention}} of legislation concerning the elected President that the initiative to refer the question to <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> should lie with the Government, and generally not with the President whose recourse was in vetoing the legislation. The Cabinet would advise the President and the matter would then be referred to <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Justice {{operates}} <b>the</b> Employment <b>Tribunals</b> Service {{which is}} a branch of <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> Service. <b>The</b> <b>Tribunals</b> Service maintains a list of claims in which Tribunals have jurisdiction.|$|R

25|$|Though {{the system}} was little altered by <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> and Inquiries Act 1992, {{at the start of}} the twenty-first century there were further calls for reform that led to the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> Service in 2006, as an executive agency to manage and administer <b>tribunals,</b> and to <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals,</b> Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.|$|R
5|$|Opinions of <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> {{cannot be}} {{questioned}} by any court. This includes the Tribunal's {{view of the}} validity of any law, the bill of which {{has been the subject of}} a reference to a Tribunal. This means that although <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> lies outside the normal hierarchy of the courts since it does not hear appeals from any courts, its opinions are binding on all other courts. It is technically open for the President, on Cabinet's advice, to refer the same matter to <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> for its re-consideration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> {{consists}} of {{not less than}} three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts. Since <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> was established in 1994, to date only one constitutional question {{has been referred to}} it. <b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) did not prevent Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. Since then, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> has to {{consider}} and {{answer a question}} referred to it not more than 60 days after the date of such reference. <b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> is mandated to certify to the President for his information its opinion on the question referred to it with reasons for its answer, and any Tribunal judge who differs from {{the opinion of the}} majority shall similarly certify his opinion and his reasons. The opinion of the majority of judges is the opinion of <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal,</b> and is required to be pronounced in open court.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tribunals</b> President had {{initially}} ruled that witnesses were irrelevant. During {{the course of}} Al Rawis testimony, the President decided that the testimony of Alex, Matthew and Martin was relevant after all. He directed <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> Recorder to locate them. <b>The</b> <b>Tribunals</b> Recorder was unable to locate them. The reason the President changed his mind is redacted.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, appeals against {{decisions}} of <b>the</b> First-tier <b>Tribunal</b> {{can be made}} to <b>the</b> Upper <b>Tribunal,</b> but only with the permission of <b>the</b> First-tier <b>Tribunal</b> or <b>the</b> Upper <b>Tribunal.</b> Before deciding whether to grant permission to Appeal to <b>the</b> Upper <b>Tribunal,</b> <b>the</b> First Tier <b>Tribunal</b> must consider whether to subject its own decision to 'Reconsideration'. In the case of Criminal Injuries Compensation and Asylum Support cases, there is technically no right of appeal, but a decision may be reviewed by way of an application to <b>the</b> Upper <b>Tribunal</b> for judicial review of <b>the</b> First-tier <b>Tribunal's</b> decision.|$|R
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President to refer to <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following {{the day when the}} Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. <b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Lands <b>Tribunal</b> was a <b>tribunal</b> in <b>the</b> United Kingdom {{created by}} <b>the</b> Lands <b>Tribunal</b> Act 1949 that had {{jurisdiction}} in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, {{although in the}} Northern Ireland context <b>the</b> term Lands <b>Tribunal</b> normally refers to a different body, <b>the</b> Lands <b>Tribunal</b> for Northern Ireland. <b>The</b> Lands <b>Tribunal</b> was unusual in having both first instance and appellate jurisdiction.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tribunals</b> {{had many}} {{problems}} since their creation, as the judges rarely had any formal training and were basically politicians elected each year. With the progressing degradation of Polish political system, {{in the early}} 18th century <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> became as corrupted and dependent on the magnates as the Polish parliament, Sejm. Several minor reforms had little effect until finally, <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> were subject to a major reform by the Great Sejm of 1788-1792. However those reforms, along with <b>the</b> <b>Tribunals</b> themselves, were soon annulled {{in the aftermath of}} the partitions of Poland.Crown Treasury courts were created in 1613 (Trybunał Skarbowy Koronny, Trybunał Skarbowy Litewski).|$|R
5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of <b>the</b> <b>tribunal,</b> making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm {{on the grounds that it}} violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. <b>The</b> <b>tribunal</b> agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E

The music video was also banned in all European TV channels. The edited video was re-released through VEVO on July 19, 2015.|$|E

However, after the match as they returned to the dressing-rooms, the arena went dark, signalling the arrival of a new faction, dubbed the DCC. The DCC would use the darkness to attack and layout <b>The</b> <b>Tribunal</b> as The Hardys looked on from the ramp, thus potentially building an upcoming rivalry in weeks to comes. On February 27, 2017, The Hardys announced their departure from TNA after negotiations of a new contract fell through.

However, <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal</b> is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of <b>the</b> <b>Tribunal,</b> except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and no court fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers.
