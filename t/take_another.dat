At the ceremony the mayors of cities recently made neighbors, including Grand Junction, Colorado, introduced themselves. Then Governor Calvin L. Rampton noted that I-70 was the longest road the U.S. had built over a completely new route since the Alaska Highway, during World War II. It was also noted this was the longest piece of the Interstate Highway System to open at a given time.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders {{achieved}} {{more success}} in 1999 as they finished the round-robin in fourth place, then won their semi-final, and final (both away from home) to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> championship. Hammett's achievements with the Crusaders were rewarded by being {{called into the}} All Blacks in 1999, {{at the age of}} 26. His first game was against New Zealand 'A', on 11 June in Christchurch, quickly followed by his first Test against France on 26 June. Hammett eventually played in the 1999 Tri Nations Series, and was selected for the 1999 Rugby World Cup.|$|E

5|$|The duel {{took place}} in Indiana on January 19, 1809, just across the Ohio River from Shippingport, Kentucky. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss {{provided}} the pistols. On the first shot, Marshall missed and Clay lightly grazed Marshall's stomach. Marshall missed again on the second shot, and Clay's pistol misfired. Marshall's third shot lightly wounded Clay in the thigh, while Clay missed Marshall entirely. Clay insisted that the two each <b>take</b> <b>another</b> shot, but Marshall declined on grounds that Clay's injury put him on unequal footing with his adversary, and the matter was ended.|$|E
5|$|To <b>take</b> <b>another</b> example, in his {{screenplay}} for The Signalman Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and reinforces the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories of a train crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E

While waiting, Homer tells Bart, Lisa, and Maggie {{the story of}} how he and Marge got married, and Bart's birth thereafter. In 1980, Homer works at a miniature golf course and is dating Marge. One night, they make out inside of a golf course castle after seeing The Empire Strikes Back. A few days later, Marge feels sick and tells Homer she might be pregnant. He takes her to the office of Dr. Hibbert, who confirms that Marge is pregnant. Homer is less than thrilled over the announcement, but since he loves Marge he proposes to her and she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they <b>take</b> <b>another</b> detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|After an {{effective}} 1998 World Cup campaign {{with the national}} team, Bergkamp had another productive season in 1998–99. Although Arsenal failed to retain the Premier League after losing the title {{on the final day}} of the season to Manchester United, Bergkamp was the club's second-top scorer in all competitions, with 16 goals, and finished the season as the top assist provider in the Premier League, alongside Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, with 13 assists. Arsenal were also defeated in a FA Cup semi-final replay against Manchester United in April 1999. With the score 1–1 heading into injury time, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after midfielder Ray Parlour was brought down by Phil Neville inside the 18-yard box. Bergkamp took the penalty shot, but it was saved by goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. In the second half of extra time, Ryan Giggs scored the winner, a goal regarded by many as the greatest in the competition's history. After this miss, Bergkamp did not <b>take</b> <b>another</b> penalty for the remainder of his career.|$|E

5|$|During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal, Morenz scored nine {{goals in}} a game for Stratford. A friend of Léo Dandurand, {{the owner of the}} Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, {{refereed}} the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was. Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play, and decided he wanted to sign him to the Canadiens. In April he met with William Morenz, because at the age of 20, Howie was still legally a minor. William told Dandurand that he wanted Howie to finish his apprenticeship at the CNR factory, which would <b>take</b> <b>another</b> two years. However, in July Dandurand learned that Morenz and his father had been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks, a rival team in the NHL. Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto, Dandurand sent his friend, Cecil Hart, to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost. On July 7, 1923, Morenz signed a contract with the Canadiens for three years with a salary of $3,500 per year and a $1,000 signing bonus, a considerable amount for a first-year professional.|$|E
5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> with them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join without issue, is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of getting another dog.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it {{was time}} to retire and that his arm could not <b>take</b> <b>another</b> season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice to himself and went out every fourth day to pitch. He ended up {{pitching}} 323 innings, a 27–9 record, and a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher Steve Carlton did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season, in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch the pennant. He started 41 games (for {{the second year in a}} row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing years through 2016.|$|E

Their firstscore was a 45-yd {{field goal}} by Josh Huston followed by a 36-yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to Santonio Holmes to tie the score at 10–10. They took the lead with two more field goals from Josh Huston; the first was from 36yards and the second was from 25yards. Following the kick-off, Texas took possession of the ball at their own 31yard-line with only 31seconds remaining in the first half. Young began the drive by throwing a 36-yard pass to the Ohio State 18yard-line and then the receiver ran out of bounds to stop the clock with 20seconds to play. On the next play, Young rushed for six yards and was tackled in-bounds, causing Texas to use a time out with 12seconds on the clock. On second down, OSU's A. J. Hawk sacked Vince Young for a loss of 8yards, forcing Texas to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> time-out with sevenseconds remaining. Texas put in David Pino to complete a 37-yard kick with twoseconds left, making the score 16–13 in favor of Ohio State. Texas kicked off and time expired on the ensuing 18-yard return by Erick Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Pathan was {{subsequently}} signed by Middlesex County Cricket Club for the English country season, where {{he attempted to}} regain his form after his bad start to the year. Pathan arrived in late-May and stayed for six weeks. He achieved better results than in the Pakistan series, taking six wickets at 24.66 and an economy rate of 5.41 in four one-dayers, including 3/42 against Essex. In the new Twenty20 format, Pathan took 12 wickets at 12.75 and an economy rate of 6.37 in seven matches, including a best of 4/27 against Essex. He scored 21 not out in the same match to help seal a 31-run win. However, his difficulties in first-class matches continued. He took 4/81 and 1/68, and scored 41 and 13 not out in a productive debut against Sussex, and Middlesex were only one wicket away from victory when time ran out. However, he failed to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> wicket and ended with five wickets at 64.80 and 126 runs at 63.00, scoring 68 against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time {{political}} adviser and military Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as prince consort and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their age difference, the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to reciprocate them and went on to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony. Within a year the queen had assigned the 24-year-old Rainilaiarivony to his first position of responsibility within the military, and promoted him to Royal Secretary, keeper of the Royal Seal, and supervisor to the Royal Treasurer.|$|E

5|$|The fourth Test {{proved to}} be the crucial game of the series. England scored 249, of which Bosanquet made 12 before falling to the final ball of the first day, and Australia replied with 131. Bosanquet was {{required}} to bowl only two overs. He failed again in the second innings, scoring seven but England reached 210. Australia required 329 to win, which was considered possible on a good pitch; Warner recorded that Australia's batsmen believed their team to be favourites. Bosanquet came on to bowl shortly before the tea interval and immediately took the wickets of Clem Hill and Syd Gregory. He went on to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> four wickets, at one point having taken five wickets for 12 runs, to complete figures of six for 51. England won by 157 runs to ensure they could not lose the series, being 3–1 up with one game remaining. Australia recorded a consolation victory in favourable conditions for the bowlers in the final Test, and Bosanquet scored 20 runs in the match and bowled four overs without taking a wicket. In the final match of the tour, Bosanquet scored 22 and took three for 70 in the first innings, one wicket coming when the batsman gave a catch to the wicketkeeper from a wide ball which bounced three times.|$|E
5|$|With Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers {{becoming}} the ninth and tenth {{members of the}} league, the 2005–06 season began with nine clubs (Manchester had opted to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> season out with no rink yet constructed). However, in November 2005 London Racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations. From their formation the Racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained {{only a very small}} fan base. The club had made the Lee Valley Ice Centre their home after playing {{only a small number of}} games at the Alexandra Palace in their first season. The facilities were very basic, seating only 900 people with an overall capacity of barely 1000. In November 2005, during a game against Nottingham Panthers; Panthers player Blaž Emeršič suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boardings. Further concerns were raised when a game against the Sheffield Steelers was abandoned after a piece of plexiglas shattered in an irregular manner, injuring a spectator. When a similar event took place during practice a few days later; the Racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink. With the Ice Centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at Elite League games, the Racers were forced to suspend team operations with immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|Moving into management, he {{took charge}} of Irish club Limerick in 1991, leading the club to the League of Ireland First Division title in 1991–92. He {{returned}} to England to coach at Preston North End, also serving briefly as caretaker-manager. He took up his first permanent management role in England at Blackpool in July 1994, but was sacked after two years having narrowly failed to achieve promotion. He spent January 1997 to October 1999 in charge at Notts County, taking them to the Third Division title in 1997–98. He then returned to Bolton Wanderers as manager, leading the club to promotion out of the First Division via the play-offs in 2001, {{as well as a}} League Cup final and UEFA Cup qualification. Following a spell at Newcastle United from May 2007 to January 2008, Allardyce managed Blackburn Rovers for a two-year spell from December 2008.
