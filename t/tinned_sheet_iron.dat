5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> folders, or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and seaming machines, did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the <b>Tin,</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron</b> and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the <b>Tin,</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron,</b> and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R
50|$|In 1887, Robert Kellerstrass, {{secretary}} of the Tin and Cornice Makers Association of Peoria, Illinois—a local sheet metal workers' union—began agitating {{for the formation of}} a national sheet metal workers' union. Contacting as many tinsmiths' locals as he could, Kellerstrass arranged for a founding convention to be held in January 1888. Eleven delegates from Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Tennessee met for four days. The union was founded on January 25, 1888 in Toledo, Ohio, as the <b>Tin,</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron</b> and Cornice Workers' International Association.|$|R

As Thomas Cowherd's career advanced he operated a <b>tin</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> shop plus a hardware store, opposite Brantford's grand Kerby House.|$|R
5000|$|Other stately mansions {{were built}} north of Point of Honor on Cabell Street, which {{followed}} the ridge of long Daniels Hill, {{beginning in the}} 1850s. Three large tobacco warehouses stood {{at the foot of}} the hill, with housing for workers on side streets and below the hillcrest (where managers and professionals lived). After the Civil War, they were part of the Lynchburg Tobacco Works and a <b>tin</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> foundry which employed many in the neighborhood. Rivermont was partially subdivided by Edward S. Hutter in 1873 and worker housing lots promoted as [...] "Danieltown" [...] around the time a new bridge was built across Blackwater Creek for easier access to the city.|$|R

The company sold their goods that year in their J. H. Ford Free Trade Tin Shop located on Salina Street. In March 1851, Ford advertised they were the best and {{cheapest}} tin ware manufactory in the city. [...] "I give a general assortment of tin and Japan Ware, made {{of the best of}} tin, and warranted not to leak. All kinds of work in my line will be made to order, and on short notice. Eave troughs made of the best cross tin, which I will sell as cheap as others sell common tin. All kinds of copper, <b>tin,</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> ware mended on short notice." [...] This was also the place to sell [...] "paper rags, old copper, pewter, brass and old India rubber for cash."

5000|$|When the <b>Tin,</b> <b>Sheet</b> <b>Iron,</b> and Cornice Workers’ International Association first {{organized}} in 1888, {{the founding fathers}} were not looking for trouble. Union pioneers from Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown; Memphis; Omaha; Peoria; and Kansas City, Missouri, they organized to “elevate” the trade, advance craftsmanship, and improve wages and conditions. At a time when new machinery, new methods of production, and new immigrants desperate for work were lowering standards every day, these journeymen wanted {{to be more than}} industrial “hands.” They wanted to be recognized as valuable partners in the industry. “Thorough” organization was key: Once local unions were established in “every town or city where there are seven or more journeymen,” one early leader explained, “every tinner in the country, both employer and employee, would reap the benefit, the employer by having more skilled and intelligent workmen, and the employees by receiving better pay and having more time for social, moral, and intellectual development.” From the very beginning, then, the IA saw unionization as a “mutually beneficial” two-way street. Employers, however, saw things differently. In the 1890s {{they were more likely to}} lock out union workers and blacklist organizers than to welcome them as industrial partners, and they often relied on armed guards to get their point across. Indeed, the largest employers frankly believed that capital and labor had “nothing to arbitrate,” as the Pullman Company famously proclaimed in 1894. “The first members were considered outlaws and an organizer might as well have been Satan himself,” an early leader noted. “It was well nigh impossible an organizer to get into the shops,” a situation that would not change significantly until 1935 when the Wagner Act finally legalized labor’s right to organize.|$|R
50|$|In 1862, Michael Moran {{established}} a hotel at Whiskey Point, but the area remained rural until 20 years later, when Cragin Brothers & Company moved their <b>tin</b> plate and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> processing plant near Whiskey Point. The plant and warehouses covered 11 acre, and the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad built a station at Leclaire Avenue to accommodate all the employees. Cragin also purchased a rivet company and moved machinery and workers from Connecticut to the location. Job opportunities and rail service brought settlers and a housing boom to the town, now named Cragin. Within two years, Cragin's population was 200, {{and the community}} boasted a general store, two schoolhouses, and a Congregational church.|$|R
5000|$|In the beginning, the Head-of-the-Lake (Present day Hamilton) {{was covered}} in forest. In 1815 a {{chopping}} mill became the first industry in the area. Growth of the area was aided in 1827 by a channel cut to link Burlington Bay directly with Lake Ontario, thus improving its marine transportation. In 1833, George Hamilton's settlement was incorporated as a police village. On January 8, 1833 the Legislature passed a further act [...] "To define {{the limits of the}} Town of Hamilton, in the District of Gore, and to establish a Police and public market therein." [...] When the Town of Hamilton was incorporated in 1833, one of the first orders of business, after a closely fought election where 3 out of the 4 candidates had no opposition, was to find a suitable place for the town board to meet. For the first few years they made do with meeting in local taverns such as Thomas Wilson's Inn on the corner of John and Jackson Streets. Also in 1833 (February 16), The Garland, a local newspaper, published a synopsis, Hamilton contained [...] "about one hundred and twenty dwelling houses and upward of one thousand inhabitants" [...] and then went on to list 4 public buildings, 7 taverns, 16 stores, 2 watchmakers, 2 saddlers, 4 merchant tailors, 4 cabinet makers, 4 boot and shoe makers, 2 bakers, 4 newspapers, 1 druggist, 1 <b>tin</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron</b> manufactory, 1 hatter and 3 millineries.|$|R
5000|$|Stow {{was born}} in Rocky Hill, Conn., May 30, 1820, the elder son of Solomon and Eunice (Shepherd) Stow, and entered Yale College {{in the spring of}} the Sophomore year. In 1844, {{he was one of the}} fifteen founders of the {{fraternity}} Delta Kappa Epsilon. [...] He graduated from Yale in 1846. The same year with his graduation he entered the Yale Divinity School, finishing the course in 1849. His health, to his great disappointment, hindered his asking at the time for a license to preach; and in June 1849, he engaged with his father and brother in his native place in manufacturing tools for workers in <b>tin</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>iron,</b> hoping soon to be able to return to his profession. But his health continued poor for eight years; after that date, his strength recovered, but he continued in successful manufacturing business, having also marked success as an inventor. His business was removed to Plantsville, in Southington, Conn., in 1852, and from 1871 until his death he held the vice-presidency of the Peck, Stow and Wilcox Manufacturing Company; he was also president of the Southington Water Company, and a director in other local enterprises. He represented the town in the Connecticut Legislature from 1873 to 1877. Though thus engaged he did not lose sight of the ends which actuated his theological study. He took an active part in the formation of the Congregational Church in Plantsville, and held office in it for many years. He died, suddenly, in Plantsville, of rheumatism of the heart, November 10, 1883, in his 64th year. He married, June 13, 1849, Sarah, second daughter of Stephen Walkley of Southington, who survived him with their son and daughter.|$|R
