5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through statements in <b>the</b> <b>testimony,</b> and {{can choose to}} press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in <b>the</b> <b>testimony,</b> they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted <b>the</b> <b>testimony</b> of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who {{all said}} that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
