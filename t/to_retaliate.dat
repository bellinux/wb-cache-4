Chinese troops claimed not <b>to</b> have <b>retaliated</b> <b>to</b> the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses. China's suspicion of India's involvement in Tibet created more rifts between the two countries.|$|R
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement <b>to</b> <b>retaliating</b> against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|R
5|$|On the July 21 {{episode of}} Raw, Roman Reigns {{attacked}} Orton, which cost him {{another shot at}} the title, causing Orton <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> the following week by viciously attacking Reigns and challenging him to a match at SummerSlam, which Reigns won.

50|$|On November 16, 2011, James Lukinoff, {{an inmate}} at FCI Butner, was indicted for {{planning}} to assault and kill an FBI agent involved in investigating the crime {{for which he}} was sent to prison. The indictment alleged that from February 2009 to April 2011, Lukinoff developed and pursued a plan to purchase a silencer and have a friend or family member store it until his release from prison. Once released, Lukinoff planned to retrieve the silencer and his firearm and kill the agent.

5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient {{its attention to}} the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko road and the Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Woodfull {{was being}} {{encouraged}} <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> to the short-pitched English attack, not least {{by members of}} his own side such as Vic Richardson, or to include pace bowlers such as Eddie Gilbert or Laurie Nash to match the aggression of the opposition. But Woodfull refused to consider doing so. He had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.|$|E
5|$|Some solid {{performances}} in the early 1930s led to rumours {{that he would be}} brought into the Australian team in order <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> against England's Bodyline tactics during the 193233 Ashes series. However, this never eventuated and thereafter Halcombe increasingly found state selection hard to come by. In retirement he became a well known sports commentator for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, providing description of cricket and Australian rules football matches until his retirement from the media in 1968.|$|E

5|$|That {{same day}} British {{forces in the}} Mediterranean carried out Churchill's orders by attacking Ottoman {{shipping}} off of the port of İzmir. That night at an Ottoman Cabinet meeting, the Grand Vizier's anti-war faction was forced to accept that the Empire was at war, {{and that there was}} little they could do to avoid conflict. The Russians declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914. Admiral Andrei Eberhardt immediately ordered Russia's fleet <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> against the Ottomans for the raid. On 4 November, a Russian task force bombarded Zonguldak.|$|E
5|$|The Seleucids {{were unable}} <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> {{immediately}} as general Diodotus Tryphon led a rebellion {{at the capital}} Antioch in 142 BC. However, by 140BC Demetrius II Nicator was able to launch a counter-invasion against the Parthians in Mesopotamia. Despite early successes, the Seleucids were defeated and Demetrius himself was captured by Parthian forces and taken to Hyrcania. There Mithridates treated his captive with great hospitality; he even married his daughter Rhodogune of Parthia to Demetrius.|$|E

Donald begs the Martian Ambassador to stop, but is rendered unconscious and taken aboard their ship, where he is later shown with his body parts dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated. General Decker tries to convince President Dale <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> with nuclear warfare, but the President refuses.|$|E

5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons <b>to</b> <b>retaliate,</b> but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Classic (c. 600 c. 900), {{alliance}} with Calakmul frequently {{was associated with}} the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.|$|E

5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets {{from both the}} West Bank and Jordan before the Six-Day War, some of which caused Israel <b>to</b> <b>retaliate</b> which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.|$|E
