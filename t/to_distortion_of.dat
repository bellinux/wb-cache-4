While the regular O-ring chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of roller chain) due <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the O-ring due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates. This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, X-ring chain was developed by replacing O-ring seal with X-ring seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|E

5000|$|Ulegyria is a {{diagnosis}} {{used to describe}} {{a specific type of}} cortical scarring in the deep regions of the sulcus that leads <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the gyri. Ulegyria is identified by its characteristic [...] "mushroom-shaped" [...] gyri, in which scarring causes shrinkage and atrophy in the deep sulcal regions while the surface gyri are spared. This condition is most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period. The effects of ulegyria can range in severity, although it is most commonly associated with cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy. N.C. Bresler was the first to view ulegyria in 1899 and described this abnormal morphology in the brain as “mushroom-gyri." [...] Although ulegyria was first identified in 1899, there is still limited information known or reported about the condition.|$|E

5000|$|High {{rates of}} major {{depressive}} disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those with alcoholism. Controversy has previously surrounded whether those who abused alcohol and developed depression were self-medicating their pre-existing depression. But recent research has concluded that, while this may be true in some cases, alcohol misuse directly causes the development of depression in {{a significant number of}} heavy drinkers. Participants studied were also assessed during stressful events in their lives and measured on a Feeling Bad Scale. Likewise, they were also assessed on their affiliation with [...] deviant [...] peers, unemployment, and their partner’s substance use and criminal offending. High rates of suicide also occur in those who have alcohol-related problems. It is usually possible to differentiate between alcohol-related depression and depression that is not related to alcohol intake by taking a careful history of the patient.

5000|$|Mobile number {{portability}} is implemented {{in different ways}} across the globe. The International and European standard is for a customer wishing to port his/her number to contact the new network (recipient), which then sends the {{number portability}} request (NPR) to the current network (donor). This is known as [...] "recipient-led" [...] porting. The UK and India are the only exceptions to implement the donor-led system. The customer wishing to port his/her number is required to contact the donor to obtain a code (Porting Authorisation Code (PAC) in the UK and Unique Porting Code (UPC) in India) which is then given to the recipient network. The recipient continues the porting process by contacting the donor with a porting code. This form of porting is known as [...] "donor-led" [...] and has been criticised by some industry analysts as being inefficient, though it prevents MNP scams. It has also been observed that it may act as customer deterrent as well as allowing the donor an opportunity of [...] "winning back" [...] the customer. This might lead <b>to</b> <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> competition, especially in the markets with new entrants that are yet to achieve scalability of operation.Based on {{the recommendations of the}} Authority on MNP, dated 8 March 2006,the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued guidelines for MNPimplementation in the country on 1st Aug 2008.
