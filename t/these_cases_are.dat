5|$|Between 4% and 7% {{of people}} have heel pain {{at any given time}} and about 80% of <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> due to plantar fasciitis. Approximately 10% {{of people have}} the {{disorder}} at some point during their life. It becomes more common with age. It is unclear if one sex is more affected than the other.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. <b>These</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is {{a visual}} novel {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney, and attempts to defend their clients in five cases. <b>These</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> played in a specific order; after having finished cases, the player can re-play them in any order. Each case starts with an opening cinematic showing a murder; shortly thereafter, the player is given the job of defending the prime suspect of the case. The gameplay is split into two types of sections: investigations and courtroom trials.|$|E

5|$|Redback {{antivenom}} {{was developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} {{retrospective}} review of 12 medical {{students with a}} peculiar erythemato-vesicular dermatitis entomologically caused by an endemic beetle Paederus foscipes. The clinical features, outcome in <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> and treatment <b>are</b> discussed. The students were residents of hostels in the USM campus in Kubang Kerian, Kelantan. The causative agent in all <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> found to be Paederus fuscipes (rove beetle). The most common site of involvement in all <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>was</b> the face, followed by the neck. The average duration of symptoms was two days and pruritis was a common symptom.

25|$|Sporadic {{cases have}} also been {{reported}} {{where there is no}} previous family history (<b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> presumably due to a new mutation that was not present in either parent).|$|E
25|$|Other {{borderline}} cases occur (much) later, {{and if the}} rules are followed strictly and <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> not specially treated, they generate successive new moon dates that are 1, 28, 59, or (very rarely) 58 days apart.|$|E

25|$|If <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> both met, then {{a player}} with the small change in their mixed {{strategy}} will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium.

25|$|About half of {{individuals}} with Turner syndrome have monosomy X (45,X), which means each cell in a woman's body has only one copy of the X chromosome {{instead of the usual}} two copies. Turner syndrome can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely missing. Some women with Turner syndrome have a chromosomal change in only some of their cells. <b>These</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> called Turner syndrome mosaics (45,X/46,XX).|$|E

25|$|Sweden has no {{tradition}} of using juries in most types of criminal or civil trial. The sole exception, since 1815, is {{in cases involving}} freedom of the press, prosecuted under Chapter 7 of the Freedom of the Press Act, part of Sweden's constitution. The most frequently prosecuted offence under this act is defamation, although in total eighteen offences, including high treason and espionage, are covered. <b>These</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> tried in district courts (first tier courts) by a jury of nine laymen.|$|E
25|$|Several cases {{recorded}} {{where the}} King specifically forbade the tenant from alienating {{a church or}} land held in perpetuity by the Crown, and presumably the equivalent of mortmain. <b>These</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> dated 1164, 1221 and 1227. After 1217, there was a forfeiture of land to the great lord in cases of unauthorized alienation in mortmain. Henry III granted conspicuous favor to the Church and left the proclamations of 1215-1217 largely unenforced. The proscription was reintroduced and made more forcible by Henry III’s son, Edward I in the Statute of Mortmain in 1279.|$|E
25|$|In New York City, the Supreme Court in each county hears all felony cases; outside New York City, <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{heard in}} the County Court. The Supreme Court hears civil cases seeking money damages that exceed the monetary limits of the local courts' jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction over most cases in which a party seeks equitable relief such as an injunction, declaratory judgment actions, or proceedings for review of many administrative-agency rulings. The court also has exclusive jurisdiction over matrimonial actions seeking a divorce, legal separation, or annulment of a marriage. In several counties the Supreme Court has a specialized Commercial Division that hears commercial cases.|$|E
