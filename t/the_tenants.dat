5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with <b>the</b> <b>tenants.</b> He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from <b>the</b> <b>tenants,</b> such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E

5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> were large farmers who farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> {{had put the}} remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000. Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers, which led to fears from residents that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner. In September 2008 {{it was announced that}} Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than the asking price. The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the price of}} kelp, {{as a result of the}} Napoleonic Wars, was the only thing keeping Rùm's economy afloat. Inevitably, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, the kelp price collapsed, causing severe financial hardship. The laird himself was in additional difficulties as a result of having purchased the Isle of Muck during the peak of demand for kelp. He decided to evict <b>the</b> <b>tenants,</b> and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tenants</b> of {{the manor}} {{apparently}} took their name from it; a Gregory de South Stoneham (or Gegory de Stoneham) is recorded there in 1236 and 1249, and in 1315 the manor {{was held by}} Nicholas de South Stoneham (son of Guy de South Stoneham). In 1348 Thomas de Stoneham and his wife Alice were lord and lady of the manor, and five heiresses of theirs– possibly daughters– held the manor in 1367.

5|$|Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, several {{projects}} went {{underway to}} improve the city water available to <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> of Four Seasons Mall. Nearby Northwood Lake {{was included in the}} projects; as several channels between the lake and the mall had eroded. The channels affected in the projects provided water to nearly 285 acres of land in Plymouth. Several initiatives such as ponding, stream restoration, and flow restriction were considered {{to improve the}} quality of the water. In mid 2015, all of the improvement projects were finalized following two years of channel work.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to <b>the</b> <b>tenants.</b> In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E
50|$|Legally, even {{a rented}} home is <b>the</b> <b>tenant's</b> castle, and <b>the</b> {{landlord}} {{does not have}} an unlimited right of access.

The landlord must give <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> reasonable notice, before he can enter <b>the</b> <b>tenant's</b> private home.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{right of}} {{succession}} by <b>the</b> <b>tenant’s</b> widow if she was residing with him at his death {{or a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>tenant’s</b> family who had been residing with <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> at <b>the</b> time of his death.

50|$|Though the {{procedures}} for evictions differ {{depending on the}} specific laws of various jurisdictions, the general process consists of 1) giving notice to <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> (and any other person residing there as well) to take prompt action to either correct the problem or otherwise leave the premises (or, in some cases, unconditionally leave the premises), 2) if <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> fails to leave the premises, filing a lawsuit to evict <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> and regain possession of the property (along with amounts owed for damages, unpaid rent, and/or court costs and attorney's fees) and appearing in court, and 3) if <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> still remains in the premises, forcibly removing <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> from them via legal action.|$|R
5|$|The 'Land Question', as it {{pertains}} to the history of Prince Edward Island, Canada, related {{to the question of the}} system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island, favoured a system of renting to tenants, whilst <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> preferred a system of freehold. In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into lots to be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor Walter Patterson, who set in motion the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days after}} Parnell's speech in Ennis, a process server and {{seventeen}} {{members of the}} Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, {{they had to be}} delivered {{to the head of the}} household or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of <b>the</b> <b>tenants,</b> but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area descended on the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.|$|E

Sing seeks to restore his confidence after being humiliated as a young boy while trying to protect a mute girl from bullies, due to the failure of the Buddhist Palm method he had learned from a pamphlet he bought from a beggar. Sing and Bone attempt to intimidate the residents of Pig Sty Alley but are chased off by its Landlady. Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of Sing and Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of <b>the</b> <b>tenants,</b> Coolie, Tailor, and Donut, reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and Donut are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal that they too are martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and Donut die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in existence for twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E
