The cover was unveiled in August 2006, of which the image depicts the United Nations headquarters in flames and being destroyed by flying oil barrels.

Although the cover of <b>the</b> <b>CD</b> was not the winner of the contest, Mustaine chose it as his favorite picture, and wanted it for the cover.

Some key extensions have been made to <b>the</b> <b>C</b> 62 x VelociTI architecture to allow <b>the</b> <b>C</b> 64 x DSP to perform more work each clock cycle. These extensions include wider data paths, a larger register file, greater orthogonality and new instructions that support packed data processing. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>C</b> 64 x is object code compatible with <b>the</b> <b>C</b> 62 x allows you to run existing C 62 x code on <b>the</b> <b>C</b> 64 x without recompiling.

40|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> <b>C</b> defect were studied by consecutive {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} observations. Not only the transformation of <b>the</b> <b>C</b> defect into a C 2 defect but also the reverse transition, a C 2 to C structural change, and a more complicated C to C 2 –C 2 transformation were observed. All of the experimental results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>C</b> 2 defect is a metastable and excited state of <b>the</b> <b>C</b> defect that has a similar electronic structure to <b>the</b> <b>C</b> defect.
