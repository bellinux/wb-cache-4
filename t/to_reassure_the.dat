5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this modernisation, and {{it was used to}} communicate the modernisation of the party to the public; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague {{recommended that the}} plan be redesigned primarily {{as a means of}} deterrence. Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room. While in jail {{awaiting}} trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter {{to one of his}} lawyers in order <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> Sheikh that {{this was not the case}} and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|One of Dekanozov′s primary goals was the {{organization}} of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation. On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was in effect a resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers. On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government, known as the People's Government. Merkys and Urbšys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia. Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius as Prime Minister. The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime. Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power {{rather than as a}} loss of independence.|$|E

5|$|UNPROFOR and the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) {{requested}} the HV to withdraw to positions held before the offensive, but the HV declined the request. However, Croatia agreed that UNPROFOR and ECMM monitors {{would continue to}} be present in the pink zones when Croatia assumed control over them. The move was planned as a way <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> Serb population that the pink zones could provide them safety. In the aftermath of the offensive, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) adopted the UNSC Resolution 762, urging cessation of hostilities in or near the UNPAs, and urging the HV to pull back to positions held before 21 June. The 113th Brigade of the HV remained at the plateau regardless. The resolution authorised the UNPROFOR to perform monitoring of the pink zones. It also recommended establishment of a joint commission chaired by an UNPROFOR representative, and including representatives of the Government of Croatia, local authorities and the ECMM to oversee restoration of Croatian control in the pink zones.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed the trust and respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> <b>the</b> potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

500|$|The debate's {{focus on}} the public {{perception}} of nanotechnology has also received commentary. Political blogger Glenn Reynolds stated that [...] "the business community is afraid that advanced nanotechnology just seems too, well, spooky—and worse, that discussions of potentially spooky implications will lead to public fears that might get into the way of bringing products to market." [...] Lawrence Lessig criticized the scientific establishment, represented by Smalley, for arguing that [...] "if so-called dangerous nanotech can be relegated to summer sci-fi movies and forgotten after Labor Day, then serious work can continue, supported by billion-dollar funding and uninhibited by the idiocy that buries, for example, stem cell research." [...] Kurzweil wrote that Smalley's approach <b>to</b> <b>reassuring</b> <b>the</b> public would backfire because it denied both the benefits and risks of molecular nanotechnology.|$|R
