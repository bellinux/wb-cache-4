25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>as</b> judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E
25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>as</b> humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said [...] "show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." [...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists <b>that</b> <b>we,</b> <b>as</b> a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them." ...|$|E

[...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed {{his interest in the}} role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film."
