5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>manager</b> appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E

40|$|Background and {{research}} problem: Reward system is today a common tool {{for companies to}} make sure their employees achieve their goals. An interesting aspect is how companies reward their <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> who have a complex role because they ought to handle goals set by the superiors and requests from the employees. When it comes to the framing of the reward system, the complexity of the role as a middle manager is appealing. The personal differences, concerning the employees’ personalities, are another aspect the companies need to take in consideration {{when it comes to the}} reward systems framing. With this background our research problem is as follows: How to reward <b>store</b> <b>managers?</b> Specific interest will be put into how personal differences and complexity in the role of a middle <b>manager</b> influences <b>store</b> managers’ perception of reward system. Purpose: To understand how <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> experience <b>the</b> reward system in relation to their own situation and interest. Methodology: This thesis is based on a case study with two cosmetics- and health companies, Kicks and The Body Shop. For the empirical data, interviews have been made with <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> at <b>the</b> two companies. We have also taken use of scientific literature for the theoretical background. Conclusions and results: When the purpose with a reward is to motivate <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> to perform their very best, it might be difficult for the companies to find the right measurements for the specific company. It is also of great importance to make sure that <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> understand what goals they have to achieve. Concerning a well functioning reward system, there are two factors to take in consideration. The first one is the complexity of the role as a <b>store</b> manager; and <b>the</b> second one is the existing personal differences, regarding <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> opinions and references about the reward system. Suggestions for further research: Because the companies in this thesis are dominated by women, it would be interesting to make a comparison concerning the reward system with a company dominated by men. Another interesting aspect is what impact cultural differences might have on the reward system’s framing...|$|R
40|$|Summary                                                               Overweight {{and obesity}} in Sweden {{and in the}} rest of the industrialized world {{continues}} to increase. This results in increased costs both to society and the healthcare system. Part of this development is the increasing consumption of sugar and that is what should be restricted to tackle this growing social problem. Part of the increased consumption of sugar in Sweden was the launch of pick and mix ingrocery stores.   This study aims to examine how <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> look at their public health responsibilities, and investigate how <b>managers</b> of grocery <b>stores</b> think about health and health aspects in general and about the sugar consumption in particular. Semi-structured "face to face" interviews was used to collect data and seven grocery <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> participated in <b>the</b> study. The interviews were analyzed using concentration of sentences that involves compiling the interviewees' statements into shorter formulations. Results of the study showed that all <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> claimed to take the health responsibilities that can be expected of them. The health aspects taken into account by <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> were that they provided good organic and locally produced groceries and that some of them had collaboration with a dietician or people with other professions related to food. It was considered easy to buy good and healthy food by all <b>store</b> <b>managers.</b> <b>The</b> question regarding the introduction of a sugar tax divided <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers,</b> 4 of them were positive to taxation, while 3 of them were more hesitant about its effects. The conclusion of this study is that <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> are taking some responsibility to the public health by providing healthy alternatives. However there is much more they can do to reduce sugar consumption among the population, thus contributing to an important public health work...|$|R

40|$|Retail <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> may {{not follow}} order advices {{generated}} by an automated inventory replenishment system if their incentives dier from the cost minimization {{objective of the}} system or if they perceive the system to be suboptimal. We study the ordering behavior of retail <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior and investigate their potential drivers. Using orders, shipments, and POS data for 19; 417 item-store combinations over 5 stores, we nd that <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> systematically modify automated order advices by advancing orders from peak to non-peak days. We show that order advancement is explained signicantly by hypothesized product characteristics, such as case-pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our results suggest that <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> add value. They improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. We test a heuristic procedure, based on our regression results, to modify order advices to mimic <b>the</b> behavior of <b>store</b> <b>managers.</b> Our method performs better than <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>managers</b> by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar average days of inventory...|$|R
