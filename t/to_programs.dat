In the 1980s extensive remodelling of the White House was done. In April 2001, The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park, where its training staff were already located.

With a budget of £20,000,000 and individual contributions as high as £500,000, improvements <b>to</b> <b>programs</b> and facilities have been ongoing since then {{in preparation for the}} 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007, which was the 100th anniversary of Scouting, hosted at nearby Hylands Park, Chelmsford, Essex with related activities also being held at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Park provides The Scout Association with over £1,000,000 a year through conference fees, accommodation fees, and sales of materials.|$|E

Theanalysis process revealed five different ways in which students go about learning toprogram in introductory university level units. These are captured in categories ofdescription which capture the critical dimensions of what students learn as well ashow they go about learning. Students may go about learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> by: • Following – where learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> is experienced as ‘getting through’ the unit. • Coding – where learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> is experienced as learning to code • Understanding and integrating – where learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> is experienced as learning <b>to</b> write a <b>program</b> through understanding and integrating concepts • Problem solving – where learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> is experienced as learning to {{do what it takes to}} solve a problem • Participating or enculturation – where learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> is experienced as discovering what it means to become a programmer The mapping of the variation constitutes a framework within which one aspect of theteaching and learning of introductory programming, how students go about it, may beunderstood.

5|$|Leading {{national}} accreditation groups {{attempted to}} disaccredit many of Kentucky's public colleges during Clements administration {{in order to}} end longstanding political interference in the higher education system. Clements worked to help these colleges maintain their accreditation and to secure re-accreditation for Morehead State Teachers College. In 1948, he weakened Kentucky's Day Law—which enforced segregation of the state's education system—by providing an exception for black medical personnel to take post-graduate courses in white public hospitals. He also supported a 1948 bill that allowed blacks to pursue medical training at the University of Louisville. His efforts to secure a similar arrangement at the University of Kentucky were not successful, despite the governor's status as ex-officio chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1949, the federal district court in Lexington granted blacks admission <b>to</b> <b>programs</b> at the University of Kentucky if an equivalent program was not available at Kentucky State College, the state's historically black college.|$|E
5|$|Patton's opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, {{hurt his}} {{campaign}} by aligning {{himself with the}} Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), passed in 1990 during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of education reform deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting blocs such as organized labor and African-Americans turned out in force for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by Congressional Republicans <b>to</b> <b>programs</b> affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787votes to 479,227.

40|$|The {{quest for}} {{a better way to}} learn and teach programming, in {{particular}} object-oriented programming, is a challenge that continues to intrigue computer science educators. Even after decades of research in learning <b>to</b> <b>program,</b> educators still search for the optimal instructional approach that will solve the `learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> effectively' problem among introductory programming students. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain insight into, and to suggest possible explanations for, the "qualitatively different ways" in which students experience learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> using an object-oriented <b>programming</b> language, and <b>to</b> recommend teaching and learning strategies as a result of the outcomes of the research. In order to achieve these aims, a combination of phenomenographic research methods and elements of activity theory have been employed to gain an in depth understanding of pre- and in-service teachers' learning experiences. The categories of description for the phenomenon, learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> and the influence of the learning context have been analysed and described in detail. It is argued that understanding learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> using Java, in order <b>to</b> teach <b>programming</b> involves more than understanding learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> as it is normally taught in university programming courses. In addition to object-oriented concepts such as message passing, inheritance, polymorphism, delegation and overriding, it entails understanding how learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> is reflected in the goals of instruction and in different instructional practices. Knowledge of learning <b>to</b> <b>program</b> must also be linked to knowledge of students' thinking, so that teachers have conceptions of typical trajectories of student learning, and can use this knowledge to recognize landmarks of understanding in individuals. The findings suggest relationships among students' affective appraisals of the value of learning <b>to</b> <b>program,</b> their conceptions of learning <b>to</b> <b>program,</b> their approaches <b>to</b> learning it, their evaluations of their performance in tests and examinations and outcomes of their actions. The relationships emerged from student descriptions of their actions and the way in which different aspects of their learning and outcomes related to one another were qualitatively described and in some cases, quantified. In particular, the tensions between prior programming knowledge of a procedural language and current learning of an object-oriented language have emerged in the study. This has implications for teaching, as this study was set against the backdrop of the change in programming language in high schools, from a procedural to an object-oriented language.

25|$|An {{operating}} system kernel contains a scheduling program which determines {{how much time}} each process spends executing, and in which order execution control should be passed <b>to</b> <b>programs.</b> Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the program access to the CPU and memory.
