5|$|The {{alignment}} of today’s Route 124 was first {{designated as a}} part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, this portion of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current {{alignment of}} Route 24, was proposed for this portion of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between <b>the</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point.

5|$|What is modern-day Route 124 was {{designated}} {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 5, a route that was legislated in 1916 to run from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 5 became a part of Route 24, a road that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. In the 1950s, plans were made to bypass this portion of Route 24 with a freeway running from Interstate 287 in Hanover Township to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township; this was approved of in 1960. This freeway was completed between Interstate 78 and <b>the</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> Kennedy Parkway in 1972. The Route 24 designation was moved to the new freeway and Route 124 {{was designated}} along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point, which included frontage roads built where the new freeway ran along the old alignment of the road. Following the completion of the Route 24 freeway to Interstate 287 in 1992, Route 124 was extended west along the former alignment of Route 24 between <b>the</b> <b>John</b> <b>F.</b> Kennedy Parkway and U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.
