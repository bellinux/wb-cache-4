Under these conditions, the trace element diffusion coefficients are one order of magnitude larger than those expected.

40|$|<b>Transient</b> and <b>equilibrium</b> synchronizations {{in complex}} {{neuronal}} networks {{as a consequence}} of dynamics induced by having sources placed at specific neurons are investigated. The basic integrate-and-fire neuron is adopted, and the dynamics is estimated computationally so as to obtain the activation at each node along each instant of time. In the transient case, the dynamics is implemented so as to conserve the total activation entering the system. In our equilibrium investigations, the internally stored activation is limited to the value of the respective threshold. The synchronization of the activation of the network is then quantified in terms of its normalized entropy. The equilibrium investigations involve the application of a number of complementary characterization methods, including spectra and Principal Component Analysis, as well as of an equivalent model capable of reproducing both the <b>transient</b> and <b>equilibrium</b> dynamics. The potential of such concepts and measurements is explored with respect to several theoretical models, {{as well as for the}} neuronal network of C. elegans. A series of interesting results are obtained and discussed, including the fact that all models led to a transient period of synchronization, whose specific features depend on the topological structures of the networks. The investigations of the equilibrium dynamics revealed a series of remarkable insights, including the relationship between spiking oscillations and the hierarchical structure of the networks and the identification of twin correlation patterns between node degree and total activation, implying that hubs of connectivity are also hubs of integrate-and-fire activation.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} from {{a material}} science {{point of view}} is a soft network composite that plays a critical role in load-bearing joints during dynamic loading. Its composite structure, consisting of a collagen fiber network and a hydrated proteoglycan matrix, gives rise to the complex mechanical properties of the tissue including viscoelasticity and stress relaxation. Melt electrospinning writing allows the design and fabrication of medical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) fibrous networks for the reinforcement of soft hydrogel matrices for cartilage tissue engineering. However, these fiber-reinforced constructs underperformed under dynamic and prolonged loading conditions, suggesting that more targeted design approaches and material selection are required to fully exploit the potential of fibers as reinforcing agents for cartilage tissue engineering. In the present study, we emulated the proteoglycan matrix of articular cartilage by using highly negatively charged star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol) /heparin hydrogel (sPEG/Hep) as the soft matrix. These soft hydrogels combined with mPCL melt electrospun fibrous networks exhibited mechanical anisotropy, nonlinearity, viscoelasticity and morphology analogous to those of their native counterpart, and provided a suitable microenvironment for in vitro human chondrocyte culture and neocartilage formation. In addition, a numerical model using the p-version of the finite element method (p-FEM) was developed in order to gain further insights into the deformation mechanisms of the constructs in silico, as well as to predict compressive moduli.

Other agents are responsible for drop of arterial pressure by changing position, including antihypertensive drugs, alpha-blocking agents used in urology, antipsychotics, cyclic antidepressants, vasodilators and nitrates, dopaminergic antiparkinson drugs, sedatives, etc. Only drug with true ototoxic properties will be discussed here, namely substances that are able to damage the inner ear (cochlear or vestibular damage) or the VIII th cranial nerve, causing impairment of equilibrium and/or (most often) hearing. No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.

A verifiable assumption that radon progeny on/in the surface/volume of droplets mostly remains in secular equilibrium until they begin their descent, enables estimates of their transit times to ground of typically a few tens of minutes. This agrees well with the time expected for the activity on the surface of droplets to reach the ground from heights of a few kilometers. The half lives of γ activities from B 214 i and P 214 b, 19. 7 and 26. 9 min, respectively, are on the same scale as transit time to ground and close enough to each other to measure ratios of activities from secular equilibrium (1. 00) to <b>transient</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (3. 88) within a few hundreds of minutes. The ratio of γ count rates is independent of knowledge of either initial activity or any systematic errors and thus limited only by the uncertainty from counting statistics, which from condensates of 5 - 30 l of rain viewed with 2 π solid angle by a 50 % efficient, high-resolution Ge detector is only a few percent.

We have earlier argued that <b>transient</b> <b>equilibrium</b> measurements are obtained in striatum with [18 F]-fallypride PET recordings of 3 h duration, {{which may be the}} practical limit for clinical investigations without interrupted scanning. However, the high extraction fraction of [18 F]-fallypride predicts flow-dependence of tracer delivery to brain, which may be a source of variance of the apparent BP ND in regions of high binding. To test this prediction, we conducted a retrospective analysis of [18 F]-fallypride PET data from a group of 50 healthy volunteers (age 18 - 58 years [mean ± SD: 32. 6 ± 10. 6), who had participated in clinical studies without arterial input measurements. We used the initial 120 -s integral (AUC) of the venous confluence (VC) as a surrogate marker for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tested for correlations between regional estimates of BP ND calculated by the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the individual VC-AUC. The magnitude of BP ND in a high binding region (putamen), but not in a low binding region (thalamus) correlated positively with VC-AUC, suggesting that approximately 9 % {{of the variance in the}} [18 F]-fallypride BP ND in putamen can be attributed to individual differences in this surrogate marker for CBF, a contribution equal in magnitude to the effects of age on BP ND in putamen of the present healthy control group...|$|E
