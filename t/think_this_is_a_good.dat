2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what he is talking about when it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were too smart to be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E

[...] In an {{interview}} with MTV, Jonas stated that, [...] "The story behind 'Chains' is basically that feeling that all people can relate to, it's being trapped. For me specifically in this song, I connected to love and trust and for some people they have said it's broader for them, it's more than love, it can be about anything that entangles you {{in your life and}} doesn't let you do {{what you need to do}} to feel free," [...] he said.

I do think Perfectly Damaged is an international album, and I'm really proud of it. I hope this can be the album that takes me across Europe and even further." [...] When asked, Is 'Heroes' a good indication of what we can expect?, he said [...] "Well my last album, Barcelona Sessions, was organic and kind of indie, and so I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> balance between 'Heroes' and Barcelona Sessions. It still has the organic sound, but with some electronic elements in it, and very powerful choruses like 'Heroes'." ...|$|E
5000|$|The play {{depicted}} in the film, is the American temperance play The Drunkard; or, The Fallen Saved, first performed in 1844. A drama in five acts, it {{was perhaps the most}} popular play produced in the United States before the dramatization of Uncle Tom's Cabin in the 1850s. In New York City, P.T. Barnum presented it at his American Museum in a run of over 100 performances. It was among the first of the American temperance plays, and remained the most popular of them until it was eclipsed in 1858 by T. S. Arthur's Ten Nights in a Bar-Room. As the film's centerpiece, the sequence runs about 20 minutes and is performed {{in the style of the}} late 1890s. Reaction shots show audience members at a pitch of emotional involvement: an elderly spectator is cautioned to think of his heart; a young sophisticate skeptically asks his pretty date, [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> play?" ...|$|E

[...] When asked by Politico if she thought that Putin was an [...] "incipient despot", Stein answered, [...] "To some extent, yes, but there could be a whole lot worse... when we needlessly provoke him and endanger him and surround him with war games--you know, this is sort of the Cuban Missile Crisis on steroids, what we are doing to Russia right now, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea." ...|$|E

John Murray's son, William Hathaway Forbes, married Ralph's daughter, Edith Emerson. In Letters and Social Aims, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of Forbes: [...] "Never was such force, good meaning, good sense, good action, combined with such domestic lovely behavior, such modesty and persistent preference for others. Wherever he moved {{he was the}} benefactor... How little this man suspects, with his sympathy for men and his respect for lettered and scientific people, {{that he is not}} likely, in any company, to meet a man superior to himself," [...] and [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> country that can bear such a creature as he."His cousin Francis Blackwell Forbes (1839-1908) is the great-grandfather of 2004 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate John Forbes Kerry.

5000|$|The Arena {{was built}} of wood in 1911. Not long before 1936, the Arena was clad in brick {{to reduce its}} risk of burning due to fire. On the night of August 19, 1936, 4,000 fans had {{attended}} a boxing match by Max Baer. By 1:30 AM that night, a fire had broken out in the adjacent Coal Harbour area. Despite the recently added brick veneer, the fire spread to inside the Arena. The interior exploded into flame and the Arena could not be saved by Vancouver firemen. Stan Patrick, the youngest brother of Frank and Lester Patrick, and manager of the auditorium, attended the fire and {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fire? You should have seen the one in Victoria. That was a pip!" [...] A lack of wind prevented the huge fire from spreading into downtown Vancouver. The overall damage of the fire was estimated at $500,000. Two persons were killed and three firemen injured. The Arena was destroyed, along with seven industrial buildings, two homes and fifty-eight small boats. The concrete floor of the Arena was not destroyed, and it was adapted into an outdoor dance floor named the Starlight.|$|E

The tracks on the EP were originally produced by Lorenzo with Son of Funk. This release was the first release on the Bite It!

On this track, the band drew on their shared Jewish legacy {{for the first and}} last time8 and the track reached number 8 in the UK's Echoes Hip Hop Chart.The media response was to present the band solely as a [...] "Jewish Rap Band", with tag lines such as [...] "the Jewish Public Enemy". A full-page piece in The Independent newspaper was the starting point for intense international media interest focused on the racial angle rather than the music. Framed as 'Jewish political protest rap' the Brotherhood were pursued by The New York Times, Def II's 'Reportage', NBC News, and other major media outlets. Within months, it was also widely reported that major American and UK labels rapidly despatched A&R men to live shows or directly to Bite It! looking to sign the band. The furore reached the stage where statements were issued to the press: [...] "The fact that The Brotherhood are white and happen to be Jewish is an irrelevant point, we hope people listen to the music and <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> track” ...|$|E

FSDLT (First-order Shear Deformation Lamination Theory) and Reddy's HSDLT (High-order Shear Deformation Theories) are adapted to thick plates.

40|$|Abstract — Interchange formats are {{notoriously}} difficult to finish. That is, once one is developed, {{it is highly}} nontrivial to prove (or disprove) generality, and difficult at best to gain acceptance from all {{major players in the}} application domain. This paper addresses such a problem for hybrid systems, but not {{from the perspective of a}} tool interchange format, but rather that of tool availability in a toolbox. Through the paper we explain why we <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> approach for hybrid systems, and we also analyze the domain of hybrid systems to discern the semantic partitions that can be formed to yield a classification of tools based on their semantics. These discoveries give us the foundation upon which to build semantic capabilities, and to guarantee operational interaction between tools based on matched operational semantics. I...|$|E
