5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano {{or some combination of}} courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of and of all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat {{and the idea of}} Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

25|$|Portillo {{has written}} a regular column for The Sunday Times, {{contributes}} to other journals (he was a theatre critic for the New Statesman until May 2006), and is a regular radio broadcaster on UK radio. He is a long-serving member of the panel in the BBC Radio 4 series The Moral Maze. In September 2011, he presented a two-part series on BBC Radio 4 called Capitalism on Trial. He has also presented a history series on BBC Radio 4 called <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> Forgot to Remember.. In June 2013, he presented a series of 12 15-minute radio programmes (following the daily World at One news programme) on BBC Radio 4 called 1913 – the Year Before, {{about the state of}} Britain in the years preceding World War I, challenging the view that these years were optimistic and cheerful.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E
25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

500|$|According to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] {{is about}} [...] "all the rings of {{communication}} around the world. All the rings of pollution, {{and all the}} radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> don't see, Earth could look {{like some kind of}} fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head– surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E

50|$|He {{concludes that}} though people can {{contemplate}} <b>the</b> same <b>thing,</b> <b>we</b> cannot contemplate 'the intuitive apprehension' of another. This connotes the Sartrean idea of becoming apprehensive about the awareness {{that we are}} to be responsible for our own doings, and also that we can be conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like another consciousness is conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> but <b>we</b> cannot reflect on their being conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> like <b>we</b> can reflect on our being conscious of <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> In this way we are still only condemned to making ourselves as we battle with our own consciousness, and so we don’t create the world, we are objects in the world.|$|R

Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did {{a lot better than}} I {{thought it was going to}} do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|E

[...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> set out to do is to get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E
500|$|Over the Garden Wall was {{critically}} acclaimed. Preceding its premiere, Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "funny, creepy" [...] and, from the premise, [...] "not {{as simple as}} it sounds". In TV Guide and also before the premiere, Megan Walsh-Boyle felt that the show's fictional universe [...] "sounds like a world worth getting lost in". Meredith Woerner of io9 called a preview of the show [...] "amazing", [...] "weird, and cute and great", reflecting [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> love about this oddball animation renaissance we are currently living in". Conversely, Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew judged from the same preview that the animation was lacking. While not discounting its storytelling, music, and production design, he felt that production skimped on animation; he was still looking forward to the series.|$|E
