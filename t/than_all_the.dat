5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, Helms {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, {{even though he was}} a Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, he returned to the SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. Helms defeated him and declared that he was better <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms. It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, Helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title. Helms was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that Helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; Helms retained by cheating.|$|E

In 1926, he was elected county clerk. He served two terms in that office, with his tenure ending January 1, 1934. Later in 1934, he was elected county judge. During his two terms, which lasted until 1941, he ordered the paving of 123 miles of road in the county—more <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> previous county judges combined—despite the financial hardships of the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Harvey was the {{youngest}} player of the touring party—more than six and half years younger <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{other members of the}} squad. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, Harvey had become {{the youngest}} Australian to score a Test century, by making 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer. However, Harvey struggled early in the tour and had difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team {{in the early part of}} the tour, Harvey's performances improved with increasing familiarity with local conditions, and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test, where he batted at No. 5 behind Miller and in front of Loxton due to the injury to Barnes. Upon Barnes’ return for the Fifth Test, the trio were each pushed down one position.|$|E

5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other drivers in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18. Coming out of the pits, Hamilton made an error and was passed by Trulli. The two drivers then nearly collided at the hairpin, with Hamilton holding back {{for the rest of the}} lap waiting for Trulli to pit. Trulli's teammate Glock stayed out on the track longer than all of the other drivers except Barrichello and Piquet, meaning that when he pitted, he was actually in third position and rejoined the race in eighth. Hamilton regained the lead by lap22 after Massa, Kovalainen, Trulli and Räikkönen made their pit stops, and had in the region of an 11second lead over Massa at the half-way stage of the race. Behind the leaders, fourth-placed Kubica was beginning to catch Kovalainen in third, while Trulli, Räikkönen, Alonso and Vettel battled over the final four point-scoring places.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect is so large that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest ionization energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic number, has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E

The fourth-placed Italians were already a full three seconds in arrears. Australia never relinquished the lead and {{steadily}} increased it, as Devitt, Rose, and Henricks set the three fastest splits in the race, faster <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> non-Australian swimmers.

5|$|The 1972 Winter Games, held in Sapporo, Japan, {{were the}} first to be hosted outside North America or Europe. The issue of professionalism became {{contentious}} during the Sapporo Games. Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States. Brundage reasoned that the skiers had financially benefited from their status as athletes and were therefore no longer amateurs. Eventually only Austrian Karl Schranz, who earned more <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other skiers, was not allowed to compete. Canada did not send teams to the 1972 or 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest at not being able to use players from professional leagues. Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first (and as of 2017 only) Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal; he triumphed in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Omaha, {{the most}} heavily defended sector, was {{assigned}} to the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, supplemented by troops from the U.S. 29th Infantry Division. They faced the 352nd Infantry Division, rather than the expected single regiment. Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or delayed them. Casualties were heavier <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other landings combined, as the men were subjected to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to offer supporting artillery fire. Exit from Omaha was possible only via five gullies, and by late morning barely six hundred men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started to run out of ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the draws of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} the genus Elephas and an elephant from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) under the binomial Elephas maximus in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier classified the Indian elephant under the binomial Elephas indicus. Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the Sumatran elephant in 1847 under the binomial Elephas sumatranus. English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour {{and amount of}} depigmentation. The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is native to mainland Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran elephant (E.m.sumatranus) is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the Borneo elephant, lives in northern Borneo and is smaller <b>than</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial Elephas maximus borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in National Geographic. It was subsequently subsumed under either E.m.indicus or E.m.sumatranus. Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are now extinct.|$|E
