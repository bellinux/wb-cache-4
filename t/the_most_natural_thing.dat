For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in.

[...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> <b>thing</b> in the world".

2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> <b>thing</b> you would want to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E

In: Fountains of Computing Research – Proceedings of SAICSIT 2010 (Annual Research Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists), 11 to 13 October 2010, Bela Bela, South Africa, {{edited by}} Paula Kotzé, Aurona Gerber, Alta van der Merwe and Nicola Bidwell, CSIR Meraka Institute, A Volume in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series, ACM Press, ACM ISBN: 978 - 1 - 60558 - 950 - 3, p. 153 - 159. This paper investigates {{the move from}} {{philosophical}} ontology to information systems ontologies. Ontology has traditionally been (and still is) a philosophical discipline that studies the nature of existence. In a certain time and philosophical era, there usually was only one correct or current ontology. The plural of this word did not exist, which explains the fact that academics who were trained in philosophy are often startled when they hear the plural of the word ontology for the first time. Yet, {{in the world of}} information systems, many practitioners use the plural as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>natural</b> <b>things</b> to do. Although the term ontology has been borrowed by Information Systems from philosophy, it has been given a slightly different meaning. However, the two uses of the word are still historically and logically related. The author believes that the shift – from singular to plural – was made possible by the postmodern era that we live in. Like reality, knowledge and understanding have become fluid. Software development, too, did not escape the philosophical shift from modernism to postmodernism. Indeed, one may also regard the creation of information systems ontologies in a positive way as the endeavours of academics to embrace the multifaceted nature of reality by representing subsets of it. On the other hand, the danger of formal ontologies is that, although they are meant to mirror and capture reality, ontology-based software could create hyperrealities that become more real than reality because it is typical of postmodernism that real life phenomena are replaced by representations...|$|R

And they said, We cannot believe in the resurrection of the dead, because we see nothing like it in the world around us. And St. Paul was sent to tell them. No: you do see something like it.

5000|$|Despite {{the success}} of Self-Control at the time, Anthony Mandal has noted that {{scholarship}} of Brunton has been dismissive.

The Eclectic Review also finds {{it hard to believe that}} Laura felt regret at having to turn down Hargrave initially, as [...] "we only have the word of the author" [...] that this is the case. The British Critic noted that this was a polarising work. It regarded the moral of the story as being excellent, and the situations in the novel to be improbable, but not beyond the realms of possibility. It noted that some situations were softened in the second edition. It considered Hargrave to be a hero of the story. The Scots Magazine criticised the [...] "strained and improbable incidents" [...] throughout the book, characterising them as the desperation of a romance novelist to impress the audience. Despite this, The Scots Magazine praised the [...] "lively portraits of character" [...] in the novel and the emotional expressions, finding an emotional realism in the novel despite the improbable situations in it. [...] The Times Literary Supplement writes that Self-Control seems to draw from Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Frances Burney's Cecilia. [...] In October 1813, Jane Austen wrote [...] "I am looking over Self Control again, and my opinion is confirmed of its being an excellently-meant, elegantly-written work, without anything of nature or probability in it. I declare I do not know whether Laura's passage down the American river is not <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>natural,</b> possible, everyday <b>thing</b> she ever does." [...] When writing her Plan of a Novel, Austen wrote to her niece: [...] "I will redeem my credit with him by writing a close imitation of 'Self Control' as soon as I can. I will improve upon it. My heroine shall not only be wafted down an American river in a boat by herself. She shall cross the Atlantic in the same way, and never stop till she reaches Gravesend." [...] In 1999, Kate Fullagar writes that Self-Control [...] "is clearly concerned with the difficulty of a woman earning her own living and with the importance of female financial independence." ...|$|R
