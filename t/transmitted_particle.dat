40|$|The {{traversal}} {{time for}} tunneling {{is a measure}} of the time during which the <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> can be affected by interactions localized in the barrier. The Buttiker-Landauer approach, which estimates this time by imposing an internal clock on the system, has been applied so far for relatively simple 1 -dimensional models. Here we apply this approach to estimate the traversal time for electron tunneling through a realistic 3 -dimensional model of a water layer. Observed structure in the energy dependence of times computed reflects the existence of transient tunneling resonances associated with instantaneous water structures. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we use the}} notion of {{time-delay}} to explain the physical content of the transformation properties of transmission and reflection amplitudes, {{as a result of}} a displacement of the potential. Then, we reconsider the recent analysis of the scattering problem by a finite-periodic potential, by Olsen and Vignale, to obtain the total reflection condition in the limit of an infinite number of cells. In doing this, we obtain an expression of Hartman's effect, showing that the group velocity of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> inside the potential chain can become arbitrary large, as the number of cells tends to infinity.

The time spent by a particle in a potential region is not well-defined in the standard quantum mechanics, but it is well-defined in the Bohmian mechanics. Bohm's theory is used for calculating the average time spent by a <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> inside the field region and the arrival-time distributions {{at the edges of}} the field region. Using the Runge-Kutta method for the integration of the guidance law, some Bohmian trajectories were also calculated. Numerical results are presented for the special case of a Gaussian wave packet.

40|$|We {{show that}} in wavepacket {{tunnelling}} localisation of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> amounts to a quantum measurement of the delay it experiences in the barrier. With no external degree of freedom involved, the envelope of the wavepacket {{plays the role of}} the initial pointer state. Under tunnelling conditions such 'self measurement' is necessarily weak, and the Hartman effect just reflects the general tendency of weak values to diverge, as post-selection in the final state becomes improbable. We also demonstrate that it is a good precision, or 'not really weak' quantum measurement: no matter how wide the barrier d, it is possible to transmit a wavepacket with a width σ small compared to the observed advancement. As is the case with all weak measurements, the probability of transmission rapidly decreases with the ratio σ/d. Comment: 6 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

We investigate the projectile-velocity {{dependence of the}} transmission fraction from the measurements of <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> energy spectra. It is found that the non-fragmentation fraction of C 2 ^+ projectiles increases with decreasing velocity, indicating that fragmentation occurs mainly via close collisions with the surfaces of the capillary wall. For Cn^+ (n = 2 – 4) ions with the same incident velocity, the cluster-size dependence of the non-fragmentation fraction shows even–odd alternation, implying that the fraction includes contributions from stable clusters surviving the grazing scattering process at the capillary surface.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare {{the concept of}} the {{tunneling}} time introduced in quant-ph/ 0405028 with those of the phase and dwell times. As is shown, unlike the latter our definition of the transmission time coincides, in the limit of weak scattering potentials, with that for a free particle. This is valid for all values of the particle's momentum, including the case of however slow particles. All three times are also considered for a resonant tunneling. In all the cases the main feature to distinguish our concept from others is that the average starting point of <b>transmitted</b> (reflected) <b>particles</b> does not coincide with that of all particles.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{scattering}} of a soliton-like propagating particle with {{a wall of}} bound particles, in several strongly interacting one-dimensional lattice models with discrete degrees of freedom. We consider spin-polarized fermions (anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain), the fermionic Hubbard model, and the Bose Hubbard model, using precise numerical time dependent Density Matrix Renormalization Group techniques. We show that in all integrable models studied, there is no reflection. Instead, an incoming particle experiences particle-hole transmutation upon entry and exit of the wall, and travels inside the wall as a hole, analoguous to Klein tunneling, even though the dispersion is highly nonlinear {{and there is no}} external potential. Two particles are added to the wall on the incoming side and removed on the opposite side. For spin-polarized fermions a single <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> thus shifts the wall by two lattice sites, in complete contrast to classical physics. For both Hubbard models, the wall shifts by one doubly occupied single site. In the nonintegrable models studied, the same process occurs in linear superposition with backscattering events. We demonstrate a corresponding fermionic quantum Newton's cradle and a metamaterial with "tachyonic" modes travelling faster than in an empty system.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of fossil}} fuel (e. g. coal, oil, wood) produces gaseous pollutants (e. g. nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons) and {{a multitude of}} submicron carbon particles and particles on the micrometer scale (soot) simultaneously. In general, the number of nanoparticles per cubic metre exhaust predominate the number of particles in the micrometer range clearly. For example, modern diesel engines emit a few 10 000 soot particles per cm 3 exhaust of size above several 100 nm compared to up to 107 carbon particles in the range between 10 and 200 nm. One promising approach to eliminate the soot particles in the submicron range from engine exhaust is the usage of a catalytic coated electrically heatable SiC-filter following the so- called Jülicher concept. This work {{is the first step}} in the development of such an filter. Several catalysts were investigated. They were chosen because of their anticipated applicability. A laboratory reactor was therefore developed with an externally heated reactor tube and a model soot generator. The model soot was produced with an spark discharge generator in a nitrogen carrier gas stream. After adding an oxidation media (oxygen or nitrogendioxide), the aerosol was fed into the reactor, which contains the catalyst coated onto alumina oxide spheres with 1. 5 to 1. 7 mm in diameter. The oxidation product was recorded in dependence of the granular bed temperature. Furthermore the particle phase was mainly measured before and behind the reactor with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and a Photoelectric Aerosol Sensor (PAS). The contact between soot particles and the catalyst was investigated with the before mentioned equipment taking a theoretical determination of the particle deposition on the catalyst bed based on the Happel-Model into account. The theoretical model includes the deposition mechanisms: particle diffusion, interception, impaction, gravitational settling and thermophoresis together with the mechanisms of tempering and thermal coagulation (agglomeration), which both affect the morphology of the particles. A good agreement between calculation and measurement was achieved with deviations of +/- 20 % at the most. Investigations of the catalytic particle oxidation with oxygen pointed out that precious metal as well as non-precious metal catalysts show a significant activity below 200 °C. A two-step oxidation process was observed during oxidation of the model soot and could be described with a double Arrhenius equation. The variation of the dwell time in the reactor mainly affected only the soot particle deposition in the granular bed and in conclusion the amount of particle mass accumulated under the chosen experimental conditions. An oxygen content of more than 10 vol. -% had no influence of the oxidation of the deposited particles, whereas a dependence on oxygen concentrations up to 20 vol. -% was observed concerning the <b>transmitted</b> <b>particle</b> phase above 625 °C. Compared with oxygen, the usage of nitrogendioxid as oxidation medium lowers the onset of the particle oxidation down to about 100 °C approximately. Furthermore a higher turnover was measured in the lower temperature region. Final tests with dry diesel soot and oxygen were performed to compare the diesel soot oxidation with the results obtained with the model soot. A two-step oxidation process with oxygen as oxidation medium was observed as well. The oxidation onset temperature increases by 75 °C at the most, when using the diesel soot in stead of the model soot...|$|E

40|$|We study {{diversity}} in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels. In the considered channel model the transmitter simultaneously releases {{a large number}} of information particles, where the information is encoded in the time of release. The receiver decodes the information based on the random time of arrival of the information particles. We characterize the asymptotic exponential decrease rate of the probability of error {{as a function of the}} number of released particles. We denote this quantity as the system diversity gain, as it depends both on the number of <b>particles</b> <b>transmitted</b> as well as the receiver detection method. Three types of detectors are considered: the maximumlikelihood (ML) detector, a linear detector, and a detector that is based on the first arrival (FA) among all the <b>transmitted</b> <b>particles.</b> We show that for random propagation characterized by right-sided unimodal densities with zero mode, the FA detector is equivalent to the ML detector, and significantly outperforms the linear detector.
