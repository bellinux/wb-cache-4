5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E
5|$|Somalia {{received}} universality places (a wildcard {{for athletes}} {{who have not}} attained qualification standards) from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to represent Somalia at the London Games were Mohamed Hassan Mohamed in the men's 1500 metres and Zamzam Mohamed Farah in the women's 400 metres. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by chef de mission Omar Barajab. The athletes' training at Mogadishu Stadium and in the city's roads (which was for six days a week) was hampered {{by the death of}} the country's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Aden Yabarow Wiish in a suicide bombing in April 2012, but their coach Ahmed Ali encouraged the runners not to let the event influence their training. Both competitors were not confirmed until July 2012 because the NOC did not wish <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> their safety by making them targets. Long-distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim had been due to compete but withdrew because of extreme stress caused by unsafe roads which lowered his mental morale. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

25|$|Sent to Blargies, Braithwaite {{appeared}} {{to settle down}} and accept prison life. He applied to the commandant of the prison for a suspension of his sentence so that he, and other soldiers of New Zealand and Australia, could return to the front lines. His request was passed to Lieutenant General William Birdwood, commanding officer of I ANZAC Corps. In late August 1916, Braithwaite became involved in a mutiny. Blargies had already been the scene of an earlier mutiny by British soldiers protesting at their treatment. This time, an Australian prisoner had become unruly and began resisting attempts by guards to confine him. Braithwaite intervened and dragged the Australian away from the guards and a gathering crowd of Australian prisoners, already disgruntled at their harsh treatment. He later claimed that he reminded the struggling Australian of the petition to Birdwood and not <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> this and that his (Braithwaite's) actions were aimed at calming the situation. However, he, along with three others, were charged with mutiny.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} Indonesian {{confrontation}} in 1966, Tunku Abdul Rahman and his colleagues decided to Malaysianise the top posts in the navy and air force. They offered these posts to two senior Malaysian army generals, who declined for two main reasons. First they {{felt that they were}} not professionally qualified and second because they did not want <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> their own careers in the army. Tunku and his colleagues then decided that they would select two officers, one from the navy and one from the air force, and appoint them chiefs of their respective services. They were fully aware of Rear Admiral Datuk K. Thanabalasingam's age but decided, nevertheless, to appoint him and take the risk. This exercise created history not only because Malaysians for the first time were appointed to these two top posts but also because of his age—he was 31 years old and a bachelor. Under Thanabalasingam and with Tunku Abdul Rahman's foresight and will, they were responsible for initiating the gradual transformation of the navy from a coastal navy (brown water force) to an sea-going navy (green water navy).|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1927 English cricket season, Yorkshire had had a {{succession}} of short-term captains. Generally, these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team, but Yorkshire's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership. Tactically, Yorkshire's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson. The captain's primary role was the enforcement of discipline: maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected. In the early 1920s, Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field; cricket correspondent Jim Kilburn wrote that they were in danger of becoming [...] "social outcasts", and E. W. Swanton commented that Yorkshire's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> their relations with other teams. Matters came to a head in a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield. The crowd became very antagonistic and a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest. Further incidents against Surrey that season led the captain Geoffrey Wilson to resign, though he led the team to the County Championship in each of his three years in charge. His resignation was possibly prompted by the Yorkshire president, Lord Hawke, but Wilson did not like the belligerent nature of the team and found it difficult to handle Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|Just before Exton's mayorality {{ended in}} October 1387, the {{parliament}} held at Cambridge by the victorious opponents of Richard II formally pardoned him for any treasons or felonies {{he may have}} committed in the previous years, and this parliament also forbade Londoners from making any criticisms of Exton regarding alleged derogation of the city's liberties. This referred to a rumour that in the previous (February 1388) parliament Exton [...] "sought <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> the liberties of the city by petitioning parliament to make Robert Knolles captain of the city"; but that the lords, sitting in council in parliament, [...] "have been questioned about this matter... have concluded that Exton {{made no attempt to}} do this by petition or otherwise." [...] In May earlier that year, Exton had loaned the Appellant-controlled government the large sum of £1,000; for context, at the same time, the whole city lent £5,000. On the other hand, he was also actively profiting from the situation. [...] One of the responsibilities that the King's new officers (imposed on him after the Wonderful Parliament) had was to dispose of the forfeited estates of those condemned by the Appellants, a responsibility they enacted with zeal, and [...] "at what were, we may suspect, attractive prices."

40|$|The general {{elections}} of 2017 and 2010 produced hung parliaments {{in which no}} single party could command an overall majority; in May 2015 the UK only narrowly avoided that outcome. When a parliament is hung, more than one potential government can be viable, and the constitutional rules that determine who has the first right to form the government can thus have a decisive influence on which government forms. In the past the UK has applied several potentially contradictory rules (based on conventions and principles), which do not all follow an equally democratic logic. This status quo is problematic because it can generate political controversy and uncertainty, in addition <b>to</b> <b>jeopardising</b> the Monarch's role in the government formation process.

Conditions such as schizophrenia are widely accepted as disorders of the brain but a comprehensive neurobiological account of such conditions remains elusive (Meyer and Feldon 2010).

Many psychiatric disorders have their origin in adolescence. This is a time of brain development particularly involving the pre-frontal cortex (Blakemore 2008).

40|$|Reperfusion of ischaemic {{myocardium}} after acute {{myocardial infarction}} (AMI) can induce ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, {{as a result of}} local activation of the complement system. C reactive protein (CRP) is involved in this activation. This study analysed the potential role of IgM in complement activation in the infarcted human myocardium. Immunochemical analysis was carried out on heart specimens from 59 patients who died from AMI. Serial slides of frozen tissue from the infarction site were stained for IgM, complement factors C 3 d and C 5 b- 9 (membrane attack complex), and CRP. IgM deposits were found on the plasma membrane, cross striations, and in the cytoplasm of jeopardised cardiomyocytes in infarcts of one to five days duration. IgM depositions were remarkably similar to those of CRP and both complement factors. The relative staining intensities of IgM and CRP varied greatly among patients. Similar to CRP, IgM targets complement locally <b>to</b> <b>jeopardised</b> cardiomyocytes in the human heart after AMI. Localisation patterns and relative staining intensities suggest that IgM and CRP recognise similar epitopes in the ischaemic heart, but that the relative contribution of each protein to complement activation in the ischaemic myocardium differs among patient...|$|R

Culture among Telugu Christian women has been greatly influenced by missionary activity. Both feminine assertion and missionary zeal bound the missionary women with their Telugu sisters.

60|$|Thus {{they lived}} through the months of January and February, 1881, at Morony Castle, and Florian had not as yet told his secret. As a boy his nature had seemed to be entirely altered during the last six months. He was thoughtful, morose, and obstinate to a degree, which his father was unable to fathom. But during these last two months {{there had been no}} {{intercourse}} between them. It may almost be said that no word had been addressed by either to the other. No further kind of punishment had been inflicted. Indeed, the boy enjoyed a much wider liberty than had been given to him before, or than was good for him. For his father not only gave no orders to him, but seldom spoke concerning him. It was, however, a terrible trouble to his mind, the fact that his own son should be thus possessed of his own peculiar secret, and should continue from month to month hiding it within his own bosom. With Father Malachi Mr. Jones was on good terms, but to him he could say nothing on the subject. The absurdity of the conversion, or perversion, of the boy, in reference to his religion, made Mr. Jones unwilling to speak of him to any Roman Catholic priest. Father Malachi would no doubt have owned that the boy had been altogether unable to see, by his own light, {{the difference between the two}} religions. But he would have attributed the change to the direct interposition of God. He would not have declared in so many words that a miracle had been performed in the boy's favour, but this would have been the meaning of the argument he would have used. In fact, the gaining of a proselyte under any circumstances would have been an advantage too great <b>to</b> <b>jeopardise</b> by any arguments in the matter. The Protestant clergyman at Headford, in whose parish Morony Castle was supposed to have been situated, was a thin, bigoted Protestant, of that kind which used to be common in Ireland. Mr. Armstrong was a gentleman, who held it to be an established fact that a Roman Catholic must necessarily go to the devil. In all the moralities he was perfect. He was a married man, with a wife and six children, all of whom he brought up and educated on £250 a year. He never was in debt; he performed all his duties--such as they were--and passed his time in making rude and unavailing attempts to convert his poorer neighbours. There was a union,--or poor-house--in the neighbourhood, to which he would carry morsels of meat in his pocket on Friday, thinking that the poor wretches who had flown in the face of their priest by eating the unhallowed morsels, would then have made a first step towards Protestantism. He was charitable, with so little means for charity; he was very eager in his discourses, in the course of which he would preach to a dozen Protestants for three-quarters of an hour, and would confine himself to one subject, the iniquities of the Roman Catholic religion. He had heard of Florian's perversion, and had made it the topic on which he had declaimed for two Sundays. He had attempted to argue with Father Brosnan, but had been like a babe in his hands. He ate and drank of the poorest, and clothed himself so as just to maintain his clerical aspect. All his aspirations were of such a nature as to entitle him to a crown of martyrdom. But they were certainly not of a nature to justify him in expecting any promotion on this earth. Such was Mr. Joseph Armstrong, of Headford, and from him no aid, or counsel, or pleasant friendship could be expected in this matter.|$|E
