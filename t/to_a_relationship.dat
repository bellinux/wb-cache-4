5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, Genevieve {{arrives in}} Genoa City with her presumed dead son, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), who is posing as his {{actually}} dead twin brother, Caleb. Genevieve {{and her son}} are working against Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), her husband and Cane's father, who she believes murdered her daughter by Colin, Samantha. Genevieve later lures Colin to her home where she set up a shrine for Samantha and tries to push him off a balcony because he was abducting their grandchildren, Charlie and Mattie Ashby. Colin is saved from his fall by his wife, Jill Abbott Fenmore (Jess Walton), and at the hospital it is revealed that Colin and Genevieve are still legally married, invalidating his marriage to Jill. Genevieve attempts to bond with Charlie and Mattie, however, Cane's wife Lily Winters (Christel Khalil) is against that as she believes her mother-in-law is dangerous. Colin is put in prison, and his marriage to Genevieve legally ends thereafter.

25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is an important}} source of interpersonal interaction, social integration, and forming positive and durable relationships. In fact, many people engage in sharing behaviors in order to have such social interactions and strengthen their relationships (as described above). However, this might not result from the sharing of certain emotional events. When asked why they would keep an emotional event a secret, the most frequent reasons cited were: wanting to avoid hurting someone, preserving one’s image in the eyes of others, protecting one’s private life, and protecting one’s self. Such reasons, which together constituted the responses of over 75% of participants, all concern one thing: protection. According to Baumeister and Leary, this idea of protection pertains to protection from undesirable consequences {{in the realm of the}} social sphere, namely that the revelation of such secrets would be harmful to social relationships. Therefore, instead of social integration and the strengthening of relationships, the revelation of certain emotional events could be harmful <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> and could thus result in social disintegration and deterioration of relationships.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that consumers may vary in {{the degree to which}} they wish <b>to</b> engage in <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with their service providers. The authors identify previously found and new factors that influence whether consumers expect <b>a</b> service provider <b>to</b> form <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with them. The authors then use these factors to segment consumers based on the relationship expectations they have with three universal categories of service providers: phone companies, banks, and doctors. Depending on the service type, either two or three segments emerge, ranging from consumers who are keen <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> those who are indifferent about relationships, down to those who are averse to forming relationships with service providers. Although there are always consumers who are keen <b>to</b> form <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> with their service provider, there is no "hard core" group of consumers keen on relationships with all service providers...|$|R
25|$|People with a {{homosexual}} orientation can express their sexuality {{in a variety}} of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors. Many have sexual relationships predominately with people of their own gender identity, though some have sexual relationships with those of the opposite gender, bisexual relationships, or none at all (celibacy). Survey data indicates that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship. Survey data also indicate that between 18% and 28% of gay couples and between 8% and 21% of lesbian couples in the U.S. have lived together ten or more years. Studies have found same-sex and opposite-sex couples to be equivalent to each other in measures of satisfaction and commitment in relationships, that age and gender are more reliable than sexual orientation as a predictor of satisfaction and commitment <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>relationship,</b> and that people who are heterosexual or homosexual share comparable expectations and ideals with regard to romantic relationships.|$|E
