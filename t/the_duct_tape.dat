5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E
25|$|The defense called two {{government}} {{witnesses who}} countered prosecution witness testimony about <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape.</b> The chief {{investigator for the}} medical examiner stated that the original placement of <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> was unclear {{and it could have}} shifted positions as he collected the remains. Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> found near the child's remains.|$|E
25|$|A {{task force}} {{was formed to}} proceed with what was now a murder case and several leads were investigated, such as an ex-boyfriend of Karyn's {{as well as her}} ex-husband Michael. An autopsy of Karyn's body showed that Karyn had been shot six times, once {{in the back of the}} head and an {{additional}} five times in the forehead, before being dismembered and the body parts placed in the plastic bags. Police found several strands of dog hair on <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> and remnants of cinders and tall grass. Swann was suspected of the crime as his alibi initially did not cover him for a forty-minute period. Investigators were also suspicious of several actions that Swann had performed during the initial search for Karyn and because he owned a handgun matching the type that had shot Karyn. Swann participated with police during a search warrant and was eventually cleared of suspicion after footage from an ATM surveillance video cleared him for the missing 40 minutes of his alibi. Alibis for other suspects such as Michael Jr and Karyn's ex-boyfriend also ruled them out as suspects.|$|E

500|$|In {{the five}} weeks after murdering his brother Brian, the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", Dexter has been {{followed}} by suspicious Sgt. Doakes and thus cannot satisfy his urge to kill. Trying to act [...] "relentlessly normal", Dexter goes bowling almost nightly with his co-workers. He is finally left alone when Doakes gives up and takes a night off; Dexter pursues a blind voodoo priest, Jimmy (Glenn Plummer), but finds himself uneasy and ultimately unable to kill the man, and lets him go. At a homicide scene, the victim's mother (Anna Maganini) pleads with Dexter to kill her son's murderer, gang lord [...] "Little Chino" [...] (Matthew Willig). He sees the woman's young daughter, Marissa (Jillian Bruno), and is reminded {{of himself as a}} boy, having witnessed his mother's brutal death. He leads Doakes to believe that he is bowling for the night but instead brings Chino to Jimmy's killing room.

2500|$|University of Florida {{professor}} and human identification laboratory director Michael Warren was {{brought on by}} the prosecution to present a computer animation of the way duct tape could have been used in the death of the child, which the defense objected to hearing. Judge Perry, after a short recess to review, ruled that the video could be shown to the jury. The animation featured a picture of Caylee Anthony taken alongside Casey Anthony, superimposed with an image of Caylee's decomposed skull, and another with a strip of duct tape that was recovered with her remains. The images were slowly brought together showing that <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> could have covered her nose and mouth. Baez stated, [...] "This disgusting superimposition {{is nothing more than a}} fantasy ...They're throwing things against the wall and seeing if it sticks." [...] Jurors were seen taking notes of the imagery, and Warren testified that it was his opinion that <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> found with Caylee's skull was placed there before her body began decomposing.|$|E
2500|$|FBI latent-print {{examiner}} Elizabeth Fontaine {{testified that}} adhesive {{in the shape}} of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains during ultraviolet testing. Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, [...] "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination." [...] During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, [...] "It was no longer visible." [...] She said that other FBI agents had tested <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> in the interim.|$|E

2500|$|Police {{then began}} to suspect that Michael Slover Sr and his wife Jeannette had {{performed}} the murder over custody issues, as Karyn had expressed interest in moving away to pursue her modelling career and take her son Christopher with her. Before arresting the Slovers the investigators had a veterinary geneticist perform a DNA analysis on the animal hairs found on <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape,</b> which was matched to hairs retrieved from an animal brush {{that had been used}} on the dogs Slover kept on his business property. The police used this evidence to arrest the Slovers, which would be later thrown out during an appeals process by the Slovers. The Slovers, which included their son Michael Slover Jr, were all arrested with the charge of first degree murder, although Michael Sr and Michael Jr were both given the additional charge of attempting to conceal a crime. [...] Michael, Jr. had been at work, which was confirmed, but he repeatedly called his parents that day, which made him a suspect in concealing the crime.|$|E
2500|$|The defense called {{forensic}} pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz, who performed a second autopsy on Caylee after Garavaglia and challenged Garavaglia's autopsy report. He called her autopsy [...] "shoddy," [...] {{saying it was}} a failure that Caylee's skull was not opened during her examination. [...] "You need to examine the whole body in an autopsy," [...] he said. Spitz stated {{that he was not}} allowed to attend Garavaglia's initial autopsy on Caylee's remains, and that, from his own follow-up autopsy, he was not comfortable ruling the child's death a homicide. He said he could not determine what Caylee Anthony's manner of death was, but said that there was no indication to him that she was murdered. Additionally, Spitz testified that he believed <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape</b> found on Caylee's skull was placed there after the body decomposed, opining that if tape was placed on the skin, there should have been DNA left on it, and suggested that someone may have staged some of the crime scene photos. [...] "The person who took this picture, the person who prepared this, put the hair there," [...] stated Spitz. When asked by Ashton during cross-examination, [...] "So your testimony is the medical examiner's personnel took the hair that wasn't on the skull, placed it there?", Spitz answered, [...] "It wouldn't be the first time, sir. Ican tell you some horror stories about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton {{gave his}} first {{interview}} {{about the case}} on The View. Ashton said of the verdict, [...] "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But {{from the perspective of}} what we do, this was a fantastic case." [...] He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, [...] "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death." [...] Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with <b>the</b> <b>duct</b> <b>tape,</b> [...] "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. [...] "You can't believe in {{the rule of law and}} not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the way you think it should", stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case [...] "struck such a nerve" [...] with the public. [...] "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from , it just outrages them." [...] Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having [...] "the potential to be a great attorney".|$|E

50|$|Although {{all players}} are {{required}} to recite a code of conduct before play, some may still cheat.
