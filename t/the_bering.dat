5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|After repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 25 April to 26 July, Yorktown retraced her route {{south and}} sailed again around Cape Horn {{back into the}} Pacific. She then moved north to resume patrolling <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea. She {{protected}} seal rookeries into 1894 before returning to Mare Island for repairs which lasted into mid-September.|$|E
5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included {{a settlement of}} the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal hunting in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are {{differentiated}} {{in their}} mitochondrial DNA between North American and Eurasian populations, but the nuclear genome displays a notable lack of genetic structure. Haplotypes typical of American mallard relatives and spotbills {{can be found}} in mallards around <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea. The Aleutian Islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards a subspecies, as gene flow with other populations is very limited.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{superfamily}} first {{arose in}} the late Cretaceous. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before {{the closure of the}} Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates. However, the full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.|$|E
5|$|Over <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|The extinct Protylopus, which {{occurred}} in North America during the upper Eocene, {{is the oldest}} and the smallest-known camel. During the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene, several mammals faced extinction. This period marked the successful radiation of the Camelus species, which migrated over <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait and dispersed widely into Asia, eastern Europe and Africa. By the Pleistocene, ancestors of the dromedary occurred in the Middle East and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human habitation. During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea. The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, the Yukon River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort Yukon. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{expansion}} of the Eurasian Land Bridge includes construction of a railway across Kazakhstan {{that is the same}} gauge as Chinese railways, rail links to India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, construction of a rail tunnel and highway bridge across <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait to connect the Trans-Siberian to the North American rail system, and construction of a rail tunnel between South Korea and Japan. The United Nations has proposed further {{expansion of}} the Eurasian Land Bridge, including the Trans-Asian Railway project.|$|E
5|$|Sir D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson CB FRS FRSE (2 May 1860 – 21 June 1948) was a Scottish biologist, {{mathematician}} and classics scholar. He was {{a pioneer}} of mathematical biology, travelled on expeditions to <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait and held the position of Professor of Natural History at University College, Dundee for 32 years, then at St Andrews for 31 years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, was knighted, and received the Darwin Medal and the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is {{believed}} to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago. The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers. This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, developing into the modern Canada lynx. Hybridization between the bobcat and the Canada lynx may sometimes occur.|$|E
5|$|The common raven {{evolved in}} the Old World and crossed <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which {{examined}} the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across {{the rest of the}} Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves {{are two of the}} oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E
5|$|Though Marco Polo never {{produced}} a map that illustrated his journey, his family drew several maps to the Far East {{based on the}} wayward's accounts. These collection of maps were signed by Polo's three daughters: Fantina, Bellela and Moreta. Not only did it contain maps of his journey, but also sea routes to Japan, Siberia's Kamchatka Peninsula, <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait and even to the coastlines of Alaska, centuries before the rediscovery of the Americas by Europeans.|$|E
5|$|While jaguars {{now live}} only in the Americas, they are descended from Old World cats. Two million years ago, {{scientists}} believe, the jaguar and its closest relative, the similarly spotted leopard, shared a common ancestor in Asia. In the Early Pleistocene, the forerunners of modern jaguars crossed Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait and connected Asia and North America. These jaguar ancestors then moved south into Central and South America, feeding on the deer and other grazing animals that once covered the landscape in huge herds.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{settlement}} of the Americas occurred some 20,000 years ago, when the first Asians crossed <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait into Alaska, the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the Bay Area dates to around 3,000 B.C. along {{the shores of the}} bay, with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in Point Reyes in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who were living in the Bay Area at the time of first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur in near Monterey Bay.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|In September 1879 the Jeannette, an ex-Royal Navy gunboat {{converted}} by the US Navy for Arctic exploration, and {{commanded by}} George W. De Long, entered the pack ice north of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait. She remained ice-bound {{for nearly two}} years, drifting {{to the area of}} the New Siberian Islands, before being crushed and sunk on 13 June 1881. Her crew escaped in boats and made for the Siberian coast; most, including De Long, subsequently perished either during the boat journey or in the wastelands of the Lena River delta. Three years later, relics from the Jeannette appeared {{on the opposite side of}} the world, in the vicinity of Julianehaab on the southwest coast of Greenland. These items, frozen into the drifting ice, included clothing bearing crew members' names and documents signed by De Long; they were indisputably genuine.|$|E
5|$|Later on August6, the {{weakening}} trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on {{the weakening}} cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August12. Shortly after crossing the International Date Line on August13, the storm was absorbed by a large non-tropical low over <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{operations}} in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean {{in response to the}} taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea. Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea, and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.|$|E
5|$|Summer {{distribution}} of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan {{and as far}} north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes into and out of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea. Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there. Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|The Arctic {{small tool}} {{tradition}} {{is a broad}} cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait around 2,500BCE (4,500years ago). These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits. The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000Common Era (CE).|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians and into <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then {{south along the}} coast of Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} Ursidae {{belong to the}} extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and diets perhaps more {{similar to that of}} a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European genera morphologically are very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it {{is considered to be}} an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas. While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas, in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} Russian {{settlements in}} what is today the US state of Alaska were set down in the 1790s, forming Russian Alaska, after Tsar Peter I called for expeditions across <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait in 1725, with the region administered {{by the head of}} the Russian-American Company as the Emperor's representative. Another Russian outpost, Fort Ross, was established in 1812 {{in what is}} now California. The colonies, however, were never profitable enough to maintain Russian interest in the area, with the population only ever reaching a maximum of 700. Fort Ross was sold in 1841, and in 1867, a deal was brokered whereby Tsar Alexander II sold his Alaskan territory to the United States for $7,200,000, and the official transfer took place on 30 October that year.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a Navy SEAL team {{deploying}} on a Russian whaler, the Eastern Spirit, in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Strait. As the team explore the deck, they are attacked and killed by something that literally rips them apart. Seeing his team is gone, CIA Special Agent Jason Bennett, who is supervising the mission from another location, orders any other government vessel in the vicinity to investigate. His call is {{picked up by the}} US Coast Guard ship, the USCGC Ravenswood, which heads to the Eastern Spirit. The crew of the Ravenswood split into teams, but within moments of boarding, only one remains; Tom Hansen, who hears his shipmates being killed over the radio. He sets out to explore the ship and determine what is happening.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar {{has been}} an American cat since {{crossing}} <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> Land Bridge during the Pleistocene epoch; the immediate ancestor of modern animals is Panthera onca augusta, which was larger than the contemporary cat. Its present range extends from Mexico, through Central America and into South America, including much of Amazonian Brazil. The countries included in this range are Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica (particularly on the Osa Peninsula), Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, the United States and Venezuela. The jaguar is now extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay. It occurs in the 400km² Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, the 5,300km² Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve in Mexico, the approximately 15,000km2 Manú National Park in Peru, the approximately 26,000km2 Xingu National Park in Brazil, and numerous other reserves throughout its range.|$|E
