5000|$|This {{project will}} create [...] "New Ismailia City", which will cover 16500 acres of land. This new {{city will be}} created to {{accommodate}} approximately 500,000 Egyptians in order to relieve the pressure from the crowded towns of Cairo and the delta cities. The location of this city is designed to accommodate the workers of the nearby Wadi Al-technologiya (<b>Technology</b> <b>Valley)</b> which will be built in following years.|$|E
5000|$|... el-Sisi {{announced}} that the new Suez Canal project will operate after a year (instead of three years). The project's authority said that the revenues of the canal will increase from 5 billion dollars to 12.5 billion dollars yearly. The new Suez Canal and the seven tunnels are under construction simultaneously. Construction {{of the rest of}} the projects (which include building the city, industrial zone, <b>technology</b> <b>valley,</b> and fish farms) will begin in February 2015.|$|E
50|$|The <b>technology</b> <b>valley</b> {{is an old}} {{project that}} has stopped for about 17 years and now the {{government}} announced to re-continue the project. The project's location lies on {{the eastern part of}} Ismaïlia city and consists of four stages: the first stage covers 3021 acres, the second stage covers 4082 acres, the third stage covers 4837 acres, and the fourth stage covers 4160 acres. However, before seventeen years when the project started it completed only 108 acres and then stopped for seventeen years.|$|E

50|$|The project {{involves}} {{building a}} new city (new Ismailia city), an industrial zone, fish farms, completing the <b>technology</b> <b>valley,</b> building seven new tunnels between Sinai and Ismailia and Port Said, improving five existing ports, and digging a new canal parallel to the Suez Canal. The new canal will increase the canal capacity by allowing ships to sail into both directions {{at the same time}} for a greater proportion of the canal. The project will transfer the canal cities into an important trading center globally. It will also build new centers on the Suez Canal for logistic and ship services.|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} value {{creation}} {{out of the}} acquisition, transfer and exploitation of scientific knowledge {{has become a major}} challenge for developed economies. Knowledge institutions like universities and R&D centres are important actors in this context. This paper offers a novel contribution to the assessment of the regional-economic importance of local and regional knowledge centres in the Eastern part of the Netherlands (provinces Gelderland and Overijssel) by exploring the potential benefits of supra-regional synergy that may arise through an alliance of three important distinct regional knowledge clusters (a 'supernova star'), viz. the <b>technology</b> <b>valley,</b> the food valley and the health valley. We will evaluate their performance using a multi-parameter model, to identify the key handles for regional innovation policy. Through a strength-weakness analysis the relative strengths of each of these knowledge clusters will be investigated and we explore next whether a strategic alliance of the three knowledge clusters {{in the form of an}} integrated knowledge triangle (a 'supernova star') may create significant network economies. The paper will be concluded with some policy recommendation...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{electronics}} {{are based}} invariably on the intrinsic {{degrees of freedom}} of an electron, namely, its charge and spin. The exploration of novel electronic degrees of freedom has important implications in both basic quantum physics and advanced information <b>technology.</b> <b>Valley</b> as a new electronic degree of freedom has received considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we develop the theory of spin and valley physics of an antiferromagnetic honeycomb lattice. We show that by coupling the valley degree of freedom to antiferromagnetic order, there is an emergent electronic degree of freedom characterized by the product of spin and valley indices, which leads to spin-valley dependent optical selection rule and Berry curvature-induced topological quantum transport. These properties will enable optical polarization in the spin-valley space, and electrical detection/manipulation through the induced spin, valley and charge fluxes. The domain walls of an antiferromagnetic honeycomb lattice harbors valley-protected edge states that support spin-dependent transport. Finally, we employ first principles calculations {{to show that the}} proposed optoelectronic properties can be realized in antiferromagnetic manganese chalcogenophosphates (MnPX_ 3, X = S, Se) in monolayer form.
