On this journey, Harrison sings of Rajbun's adversaries, one of which warns him: [...] "You may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard the last of Katman / … I'll be watching you 'round ev'ry bend you'll take …" [...] Inglis writes that Rajbun must face his quest [...] "without 'fears' [...] or 'tears'" [...] and cites the verse-one lines [...] "Bunbury stands for freedom / Being young and having fun" [...] {{as evidence of the}} song's [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] message.|$|E
2500|$|The squatters {{had left}} behind a final manifesto. It read [...] "We have {{decided to leave the}} {{barricades}} and our home behind. We have been faced with politicians who have proven themselves to be more cynical than we could ever have imagined. We refuse to sit like a trapped bear waiting for the hunters to come. We refuse {{to be a part of}} your sick game. You might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> won now, but you are mistaken. You have not broken us. You have shown us what we have the strength to do. The experience we have gained and most of all the solidarity and support that the ordinary people of Copenhagen have shown us is something you can never take from us. We chose to live and fight another day. You have not broken us nor have you destroyed us. We are still here! The struggle continues!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Later on in {{the evening}} Mountjoy Scarborough began again. [...] "The {{governor}} <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> behaved uncommonly well to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] {{replied the}} girl faintly. [...] "Try to forget me--no, not that--I {{could not bear}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, I don't <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> two assets {{which would}} have made people excuse {{a great deal of}} inexperience, your grace and your beauty.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are so {{delighted to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken up your cousin's case," [...] said Mrs. Walker to Mr. Toogood, {{almost in a}} whisper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} hurt MYSELF, Sam, certainly,' replied Mr. Pickwick, {{from the other}} side of the wall, 'but I rather <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>have</b> hurt me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have others," [...] he retorted, [...] "but never mind. I {{understood}} you to say, I <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{heard nothing}} by wireless about me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By all means, Mannering," [...] he answered. [...] "But since <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} {{our little}} secret, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better speak to our hostess?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better {{run along}} home. I {{will come up}} to the {{shrubbery}} after dinner, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can get out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. and Mrs. Badger {{were here}} yesterday, Richard," [...] said I, [...] "and they seemed {{disposed}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no great liking for the profession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{we must go}} by averages of course. Shall we say {{two years}}? I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a full two years before you." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} your {{stricture}} about my not writing I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no cause of complaint. My time is all {{taken up with}} public duties.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{accurately}} reasoned out the case, Amuba, {{and that}} we have penetrated the whole conspiracy. The question is, what are we to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Ephraim Savage's grim {{face grew}} grimmer. [...] "It's a man's foot," [...] said he. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> best take the gal below to the cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{hear any}} strange voice," [...] said she. [...] "The {{way you are}} staring, Peter Rabbit, one would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> really heard {{something}} new and worth while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he {{does not}} bear malice; men may be angry without bearing malice. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> shown a want of {{confidence}} in him, and are still showing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{found your}} proper sphere," [...] Brooks answered, smiling. [...] "I can't think why you ever needed me to suggest it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too modest," [...] Madame de Melbain said slowly. [...] "Louise {{has told}} me a good deal. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been a very {{faithful}} friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any {{ground for}} fear on her behalf," [...] said Mrs. Grantly, [...] "seeing {{in what way}} she has {{hitherto}} conducted herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Appearances are deceitful," [...] {{replied the}} Zebra, smiling in the {{consciousness}} of a more insupportable wit, [...] "or I should <b>have</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{come out of the}} Legislature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The weather {{seems so}} very unsettled, Mr. Montgomery," [...] remarked the doctor, [...] "that I am {{inclined}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better postpone your little country excursion until a later date." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Grey! a {{conspiracy}}, {{a conspiracy}} against the Marquess, with Mr. Cleveland. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made him serve your purpose, {{and now you}} are going to get rid of him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't be frightened, Rachel, and don't be sad. You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost him, {{but soon}} or late {{he will come}} back to you, perhaps as you dreamed--perhaps otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's good, Bathurst," [...] the Doctor said, as he entered. [...] "Boy, put a {{chair for}} Mr. Bathurst. I <b>had</b> begun to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> deserted {{me as well}} as {{everybody}} else." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} feel it. I know {{it must be}} bad for you, {{but it is not}} quite that. I will not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> nothing left worth living for." ...|$|E
