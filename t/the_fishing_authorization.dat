The equation to describe this orientation is ξh= ϕE-ϕF. ϕE represents the angle of the electric field. ϕF represents the angle of <b>the</b> <b>fish,</b> taken from three body segments as <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> bends. ξh represents the error angle, which is how far off <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> is from being parallel with the field(.

40|$|As feeding is {{fundamental}} to any animal, this thesis examined constraints on foraging behaviour {{from the point of}} view of a predatory <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> threespine stickleback, encountering prey sequentially and simultaneously. Subsequent to prey detection, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> orientated towards <b>the</b> prey and then decided to attack. The probability of attack reduced with a decrease in fish size, an increase in the size of the prey and <b>the</b> <b>fish's</b> stomach fullness and was dependent on the presence of competitors. During the attack, if <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> hung midwater <b>the</b> probability of successful prey capture was greater. Hanging was more likely to occur with smaller fish and when larger prey were encountered and was also longer in duration when prey were encountered simultaneously. When handling <b>the</b> prey, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> made a decision to eat within the first few seconds. All of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> ate to fill their stomachs, with the critical factors involved in prey choice being the size of the prey in relation to the size of <b>the</b> <b>fish's</b> mouth and <b>the</b> stomach fullness of <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> With an empty stomach, <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> ate whatever prey was encountered.

5000|$|Through {{the use of}} {{high-speed}} cameras and hydrophones, the snake's method of ambush is revealed in greater detail. The snake anticipates the movements of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> as it attempts to escape. As <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims into range, the snake creates a disturbance in the water by moving part of its body posterior to the neck. This disturbance triggers an escape reflex in <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> called <b>the</b> C-start, in which <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> contorts its body into a [...] "C" [...] shape. Normally at this point <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> would swim quickly away from the disturbance by quickly straightening its body, but the snake grabs it, usually by the head, anticipating its movement. <b>The</b> snake catches <b>fish</b> by tricking them into reflexively attempting to escape in the wrong direction. Unlike most predators, the snake doesn’t aim for <b>the</b> <b>fish’s</b> initial position and then adjust its direction as <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> moves, it heads directly for the location where it expects <b>the</b> <b>fish’s</b> head to be. The ability to predict the position of its prey appears to be innate.|$|R
40|$|When various {{developmental}} {{measures are}} being undertaken to increase <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> production in India, it is pertinent to examine if <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> methods employed are quite efficient. In marine <b>fishing,</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>fishing</b> methods in general {{depends on the}} ability of the fishermen to locate <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> grounds where <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> are abundant and to catch them there. In case of some of the pelagic fisheries like Indian mackerel, in the exploitation of which the fishermen rely on the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> shoals in <b>the</b> inshore area, <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> efficiency will depend on the ability and skill of the fishermen to identify the time and period when the mackerel shoals are most abundant in the inshore waters and to concentrate most of their effort at the time to catch <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> present paper provides a method for measuring quantitatively <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> efficiency of <b>the</b> fishermen of the Karwar area with regard to the mackerel fishery.
