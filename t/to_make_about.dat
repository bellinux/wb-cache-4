5|$|This {{variation}} {{is named after}} Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926). White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn center and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ {{to be a bad}} move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3, but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4Nec6 6.Be3. After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe55.f4 when Black has an important choice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best, while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.|$|E
25|$|The Three Little Pigs {{become the}} target of a special-ops team of wolves. The wolves' plan to finally {{infiltrate}} the impenetrable house of bricks by leaving a tiny wolf cub on the unassuming pigs' doorstep. The pigs take the baby in and raise him as their own. The newest addition to their family, Lucky, grows up into his teens not knowing his history, his role in the wolves' plan or the difficult choice he will have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> the family that raised him.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat in}} the third test {{marked the end of}} Michael Vaughan's time as captain. Vaughan had been captain of the Test team before Moores had taken over, and his {{resignation}} left Moores with a decision <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> who succeeded him. Although it was Collingwood who had previously succeeded Vaughan as captain as the ODI Team, Kevin Pietersen was asked to step in as Captain for the final match of the series. Pietersen had been in good form with the bat and was seen by many as the obvious choice. England {{went on to win the}} final Test by 6 wickets, with Pietersen making a hundred on his first game as captain.|$|E

25|$|Barker's DJ Foundation, {{founded in}} 1994 and named after his late wife and mother, has contributed {{millions}} of dollars for animal neutering programs and to fund animal rescue and park facilities all over the United States. He worked closely with Betty White as an advocate for animal rights. However, in 2009, reports indicated that Barker threatened to not attend the 2009 Game Show Awards, where he was to receive a lifetime achievement award, because White would be attending. The reason for the conflict, according to the report, was over the proper treatment of an elephant at the Los Angeles Zoo. White instead did not attend and pre-recorded her comments that she was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> Mark Goodson.|$|E
25|$|Schweitzer quickly sought other {{financial}} backers. By September, he {{had signed a}} deal (backdated to June to hide Albert's involvement) with Richard Kny, a relative of the Heyden plant's manager. This allowed the phenol plot to continue {{for a short while}} longer. By the time the plot was discontinued, it had succeeded in diverting enough phenol, according to Albert, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> 4.5 million pounds of explosives. Schweitzer defended his actions, arguing that making medicine and disinfectants was a better use of the phenol than making weapons. The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the phenol deal, with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess phenol to the U.S. military, but by that time the deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough phenol to keep Bayer's aspirin plant running. Bayer's reputation took a large hit, however, just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand.|$|E

Nintendo and Game Freak have tweaked the original and built a sequel that's long, challenging and tremendous fun to play.

500|$|In 1996, {{documentary}} filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, who {{was greatly}} moved by Till's open-casket photograph, started background research for {{a feature film}} he planned <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> Till's murder. He asserted {{that as many as}} 14 people may have been involved, including Carolyn Bryant Donham (who had remarried). Mose Wright heard someone with [...] "a lighter voice" [...] affirm that Till was the one in his front yard immediately before Bryant and Milam drove away with the boy. Beauchamp spent the next nine years producing The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, released in 2003.|$|E
500|$|... "My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I {{probably}} {{should not have}} done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> someone who bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E

500|$|B11, now {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Gravener, encountered an Austro-Hungarian seaplane on 11 November {{that had been}} forced down by engine trouble. B11 attempted to engage the seaplane with the one Maxim gun she had aboard, but it jammed almost immediately and Gravener attempted to ram the aircraft. The Austrians managed to restart their engine, however, and flew off, easily avoiding Gravener's ramming attempt. On 17 January B11 encountered another seaplane with engine trouble. This time the Austrians were unable to repair their engine and were captured. B9 was spotted by an Austrian seaplane on 29 March and eventually forced to dive after both sides failed to damage each other with machine gun fire. B7 had a narrow escape off the Austrian naval base at Pola three months later when she was damaged by another seaplane that jammed her diving planes in the [...] "hard to rise" [...] position which meant she could not submerge until they were repaired. Both B8 and B11 were missed by torpedoes fired by Austrian submarines in early 1916. On one patrol the gear teeth of B11s steering mechanism were stripped which made the rudder loose and the boat unsteerable. Relieving tackles were rigged, despite the heavy seas, but they parted under the strain after 15 minutes. Slowly the boat began to drift towards the enemy coast, but a northwesterly breeze sprang up before dawn and the seas moderated which allowed her <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> [...] by going astern. By this time she was overdue and the Italians began to search for her. She was towed back to Venice by an Italian destroyer that found her about mid-morning.|$|E

2500|$|The present (2014) drought {{has brought}} {{reconsideration}} of the Charles Meyer Desalination Facility {{that was built}} for $34 million in the early 1990s in Santa Barbara but was later essentially mothballed when the drought was over. There are early discussions about investing around $20 million more to upgrade and restart the desalination plant. They have permits <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> [...] of desalinated water per year, but they will incur additional costs to pump their desalinated water to existing higher elevation reservoirs if they reactivate the plant. The projected costs (2014) were about $3,000 per acre foot.|$|E
2500|$|Brand's process {{originally}} involved letting urine {{stand for}} days until it {{gave off a}} terrible smell. Then he boiled {{it down to a}} paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, [...] While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about [...] of urine <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> 60g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.|$|E

The articles were later collected into multi-volume book series of the same name. In 1921, Ford cited evidence of a Jewish threat: [...] "The only statement I care <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>about</b> the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on. They are 16 years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time." [...] Robert A. Rosenbaum wrote that [...] "In 1927, bowing to legal and economic pressure, Ford issued a retraction and apology—while disclaiming personal responsibility—for the anti-Semitic articles and closed the Dearborn Independent in 1927.

2500|$|The art of {{distillation}} {{spread to}} Ireland and Scotland {{no later than}} the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling [...] "aqua vitae" [...] or spirit alcohol primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes {{the death of a}} chieftain in 1405 to [...] "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" [...] at Christmas.
