2500|$|The limited {{schedule}} for Live It Up meant that DeWyze {{had to write}} his songs while on tour, which he found to be an overwhelming task. He has said {{this was one of}} the reasons for why the album did not live up to expectations and has also explained that there was pressure in trying to work with a large number of people, all of whom had their own ideas. He described the situation as [...] "one of those too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen kind of things". Although DeWyze felt that he and RCA were not <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> regarding his musical style, he still had high hopes about recording a second album with them and trying to take it in a different direction, but in September 2011, he was dismissed by the label. He said that this was disheartening and not what he would have expected, but that the decision was [...] "fairly mutual" [...] and followed a series of talks between him and RCA.|$|E

His lips, between comely grey moustache and comely pointed beard, wore a mortified smile, and he gazed rather dazedly at the spindleberries fallen on to the flagged courtyard from the branch she had brought to show him. Why had she thrown up her head as if he had struck her, and whisked round so that those dull-pink berries quivered and lost their rain-drops, and four had fallen? He had but said: [...] "Charming! I'd like to use them!" [...] And she had answered: [...] "God!" [...] and rushed away. Alicia really was crazed; {{who would have thought that}} once she had been so adorable!

50|$|Edman {{spent his}} early years at the Institute {{designing}} and producing a machine that automated protein sequencing. In 1958 RMIT graduate Geoffrey Begg was employed as a junior laboratory assistant to Edman and became intimately involved in the project. Describing how the idea came to fruition, Begg said, “I was sitting having {{a cup of tea}} with some of the research blokes one day, just after I’d joined in 1958, and we were talking about how repetitive their analysis work was…I asked them why they didn’t invent a machine to speed up all the repetitive work. I was only a laboratory assistant and they all laughed, so I forgot about it. But apparently Dr Edman had been <b>thinking</b> about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> He heard about this and asked me if I could make a model of a possible machine.” The next day, Begg brought an electric motor from home and aided by his glass blowing skills, showed that the idea was feasible.

40|$|The popular {{notion of}} {{psychoanalysis}} {{in our culture}} is often one of a racy and prejudiced kind of translation. Both the highbrow and the lowbrow seem to reduce analysis to the one-dimensional basic concept of our human condition: libido. Whereas others simply become enraptured with beautiful works of art, with spiritual or mystical language or high-flown ideals, the analyst monotonously points to the small difference that renders all major cultural distinctions void: sex. Whenever obscure statements are made, strange symptoms occur, or the wildest delusions flourish, the analyst man-ages to interpret the incomprehensible unambiguously {{by pointing out that}} all of us are <b>thinking</b> about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> all <b>the</b> time: sex. If you present someone with a bouquet of flowers, the analyst will remind you that flowers are a plant’s sex organs. When you tell your analyst that you are troubled by the fact that you sometimes feel a severe anxiety attack coming on that you can only avert by frenetic counting, he will smile reassuringly.

Ormsgill, who had been driven until the sweat of anguished effort dripped from him, wondered vaguely what a man with brains and nerve and money might do on the negroes' behalf {{in spite of the}} opposition of a corrupt administration. The priest was also wondering how much he could accomplish with Lamartine's bequest, very little of which would, however, in all probability, be allowed to remain in his hands, though he knew that it would in any case not go very far, for he was one who recognized that the new beneficent order must be evolved slowly, here a little and there a little, with other men to carry out what he had begun.

40|$|In {{our days}} not only {{teachers}} and parents hope for the schools to become inclusive, but all the society seems to understand and advocate for this need. However, {{when we talk about}} inclusion are we <b>thinking</b> about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing?</b> Do we have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> perception of <b>the</b> needs, so that inclusion can really happen? In order to answers these questions a study was conducted using a questionnaire whose main objective was to understand how teachers understand and perceive the education of the pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN). 249 teachers participated in the study, all from elementary schools located in Braga, Northern Portugal. The questionnaire had 25 items, divided into three main clusters: (1) Attitudes; (2) Resources; and (3) Collaboration. The results showed significant differences between some of the items and the variables gender, academic qualifications and professional experience. Based on these results, this research indicates that, although participants recognize {{that it is important to}} implement the philosophy of inclusion in Portugal, it is necessary to provide more training for all individuals involved in the education of students with SEN. They also indicated that there is a lack of specialized human resources needed to provide quality educational responses for the abovementioned students...|$|R
60|$|Philip went to {{the public}} baths in Westminster and spent sixpence on a bath. Then he got himself {{something}} to eat. He {{did not know what}} to do with himself in the afternoon. He would not go back to the hospital in case anyone should ask him questions, and besides, he had nothing to do there now; they would wonder in the two or three departments he had worked in why he did not come, but they must think what they chose, it did not matter: he would not be the first student who had dropped out without warning. He {{went to the}} free library, and looked at the papers till they wearied him, then he took out Stevenson's New Arabian Nights; but he found he could not read: the words meant nothing to him, and he continued to brood over his helplessness. He kept on <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> all <b>the</b> time, and the fixity of his thoughts made his head ache. At last, craving for fresh air, he went into the Green Park and lay down on the grass. He thought miserably of his deformity, which made it impossible for him to go to the war. He went to sleep and dreamt that he was suddenly sound of foot and out at the Cape in a regiment of Yeomanry; the pictures he had looked at in the illustrated papers gave materials for his fancy; and he saw himself on the Veldt, in khaki, sitting with other men round a fire at night. When he awoke he found that it was still quite light, and presently he heard Big Ben strike seven. He had twelve hours to get through with nothing to do. He dreaded the interminable night. The sky was overcast and he feared it would rain; he would have to go to a lodging-house where he could get a bed; he had seen them advertised on lamps outside houses in Lambeth: Good Beds sixpence; he had never been inside one, and dreaded the foul smell and the vermin. He made up his mind to stay in the open air if he possibly could. He remained in the park till it was closed and then began to walk about. He was very tired. The thought came to him that an accident would be a piece of luck, so that he could be taken to a hospital and lie there, in a clean bed, for weeks. At midnight he was so hungry that he could not go without food any more, so he went to a coffee stall at Hyde Park Corner and ate a couple of potatoes and had a cup of coffee. Then he walked again. He felt too restless to sleep, and he had a horrible dread of being moved on by the police. He noted that he was beginning to look upon the constable from quite a new angle. This was the third night he had spent out. Now and then he sat on the benches in Piccadilly and towards morning he strolled down to The Embankment. He listened to the striking of Big Ben, marking every quarter of an hour, and reckoned out how long it left till the city woke again. In the morning he spent a few coppers on making himself neat and clean, bought a paper to read the advertisements, and set out once more on the search for work.|$|R
6000|$|But {{when the}} sun went down and the steamer turned and began to steam back towards civilisation, again her fears were calmed. In the semi-darkness the chairs on deck and the people sitting in them were angular shapes, the mouth being {{indicated}} by a tiny burning spot, and the arm by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> spot moving up or down as the cigar or cigarette was lifted to and from the lips. Words crossed the darkness, but, not knowing where they fell, seemed to lack energy and substance. Deep sights proceeded regularly, although with some attempt at suppression, from the large white mound which represented the person of Mrs. Flushing. The day had been long and very hot, and now that all the colours were blotted out the cool night air seemed to press soft fingers upon the eyelids, sealing them down. Some philosophical remark directed, apparently, at St. John Hirst missed its aim, and hung so long suspended in the air until it was engulfed by a yawn, that it was considered dead, and this gave the signal for stirring of legs and murmurs about sleep. The white mound moved, finally lengthened itself and disappeared, and after a few turns and paces St. John and Mr. Flushing withdrew, leaving the three chairs still occupied by three silent bodies. The light which came from a lamp high on the mast and a sky pale with stars left them with shapes but without features; but even in this darkness the withdrawal of the others made them feel each other very near, for they were all <b>thinking</b> of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> For some time no one spoke, then Helen said with a sigh, [...] "So you're both very happy?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Groupthink, {{or taking}} on the mindset {{of the rest of}} the group members, can also act as an {{unnecessary}} constraint while trying to solve problems. This is due to the fact that with everybody <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> stopping on the same conclusions, and inhibiting themselves to think beyond this. This is very common, but the most well-known example of this barrier making itself present is in the famous example of the dot problem. In this example, there are nine dots lying in a square- three dots across, and three dots running up and down. The solver is then asked to draw no more than four lines, without lifting their pen or pencil from the paper. This series of lines should connect all of the dots on the paper. Then, what typically happens is the subject creates an assumption in their mind that they must connect the dots without letting his or her pen or pencil go outside of the square of dots. Standardized procedures like this can often bring mentally invented constraints of this kind, and researchers have found a 0% correct solution rate in the time allotted for the task to be completed. The imposed constraint inhibits the solver to think beyond the bounds of the dots. It is from this phenomenon that the expression [...] "think outside the box" [...] is derived.|$|E

Katie is <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> and decides to invite them all to a sleepover, where she hopes they can discuss things and work through whatever theyre going through. Everyone accepts, but once everyone gets there, its awkward, and quite simply, they have forgotten how to relate with each other because it has been awhile since they have really done so. After a fierce argument, they go to sleep. Each of them has a dream where they are another in the group, and have to deal with their issues. For instance, Christie is Beth, Beth is Jana, Jana is Katie, Katie is Melanie, and Melanie is Christie. The dream lasts about a week and each girl is able to view the stressors in the other girls life from a different perspective, and realize certain things about each girl. They each get a chance to step into each others shoes and live their lives. Once they wake up, they calmly discuss this and although they are separate people with different interests, they realize that having those differences is a special part of each of them, and that it combines to so much more when they are all together.|$|E
5000|$|Art in {{the novel}} {{illustrates}} the struggle with AIDS, a community, and a means of identity. Perhaps the simplest connection to AIDS is in the fear of death {{and the creation of}} immortality. As an artist, one can be remembered, leaving something physical behind that will be protected or kept. Samir visits Mohammad and Scott and is inspired by Mo (a nickname given to him by other characters that he dislikes) and paints a portrait of their friend Juan, who just died (140). He then paints Steve, who also just died (140). By painting people who have just died, the painter preserves the subject. Regardless of the quality, the paintings are a tribute to their memory. Scott acknowledges this ability in art and asks Mo to use his ashes in a painting specifically so that he may be immortal (103). He is not only going to carry on through an image but knows that people will look at a painting of him and it will most likely be appreciated and never destroyed. In asking for his ashes on canvas, {{he will be able to}} actually physically remain a part of people's lives. Granted, this is a hard task for Mo, who ultimately paints his best friend into a peaceful lotus blossom. Scott epitomizes the theory behind using art as a refuge and as preserving oneself. Art is a part of Kurt's death wish as well when he asks Mo to take his paintings. He says [...] "I know they're not worth much. You can take them while I go on my trip" [...] (140). Kurt, lying on his death bed, leaves his work to Mo, who is his lover, but also in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> situation. As a part of the gay art community, Mo knows that Kurt means he cannot take his paintings after he dies, but that he wants them to remain somewhere. Through looking at the fact that the characters of the art community think about where there art will end up after their death gives the feeling that perhaps while alive they were <b>thinking</b> of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> that to an extent the art could preserve them.|$|R
40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{examine and}} resolve a fundamental and previously unnoted tension between Spinoza’s metaphysics and his moral philosophy. Spinoza’s metaphysics, I argue, entails that bodies have temporal (as well as spatial) parts; his moral philosophy, however, requires that human bodies (and minds) lack temporal parts. In this dissertation I defend a charitable reconstruction of Spinoza’s theory of bodily persistence which resolves this tension. ^ I begin the dissertation with two chapters concerning {{the nature of}} time. In the first chapter I argue that according to Spinoza all bodies (whether past, present, or future) are equally real. I argue that if God’s mind has adequate ideas of all present bodies (a claim all Spinoza scholars accept), then it must also have adequate ideas of all past and future bodies as well. But given Spinoza’s parallelism, if God’s mind has an adequate idea of a body, then it must exist. Thus, all bodies (whether past, present, or future) must exist in a Spinozistic universe. In the second chapter I argue that, in Spinoza, temporal passage (or the “moving now”) is an illusion arising in exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as <b>the</b> illusion of {{the closeness of the}} sun and the illusion of libertarian free will. Thus, Spinoza’s theory of time is not only eternalist, but also tenseless. ^ The third chapter concerns the nature of bodies. In this chapter I argue against the widespread view that Spinoza offers two different theories of bodily essence in the Ethics (the “ratio of motion and rest” theory after 2 p 13 s and the “striving [conatus] theory” at 3 p 7). This mistaken view arises from an ambiguity in the literature concerning exactly what kind of thing a conatus is supposed to be. Some scholars claim that a conatus is a tendency, others that it is a force, and still others that it is an activity. Many scholars are inconsistent on the issue. In this chapter I provide a new argument for the activity interpretation of conatus. Striving is something that bodies do. Furthermore, I argue that once this confusion is resolved it quickly follows that a “ratio of motion and rest” and a “conatus” are two ways of <b>thinking</b> about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> (namely, <b>the</b> essence of a body). I conclude that Spinoza offers only one theory of bodily essence in the Ethics. ^ In the fourth chapter I reveal the basic tension within Spinoza’s system. If the essence of a body is a complex motion, then (given Spinoza’s Cartesian theory of motion) it follows that the essence of a body must be temporally extended. Moreover, given Spinoza’s theory of time, it follows that each temporal part of a body’s essence must also exist. Thus, it seems as though bodies must be temporally extended and have temporal parts. This conclusion is deeply problematic, however, because Spinoza’s moral and political philosophy presupposes a theory of human bodies (and minds) whereby they do not have temporal parts. Thus, Spinoza seems to be committed to a contradiction {{at the very heart of}} his system. ^ In the fifth and final chapter I provide a charitable reconstruction of Spinoza’s views on the nature and persistence of bodies which reconciles his metaphysics with his moral philosophy. While this solution cannot be directly attributed to Spinoza, I argue that it follows naturally from his other commitments and is likely consistent with the rest of his system. In short, I argue that Spinoza has the resources within his own metaphysics to accept a kind of (what we would today call) “stage” or “exdurance” theory of persistence. According to this theory, persistence is not a matter of diachronic identity nor temporal parts. Instead a body persists by having “temporal counterparts” or “stages” at later and earlier moments. The key part of any such theory is explaining how a stage can be in some sense <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as earlier and later stages without being identical to them. Spinoza’s theory of formal and actual essence, I argue, provides a perfect basis for such a distinction. Spinoza, I conclude, can avoid the tension in his system without any significant costs by accepting a “stage theory” of persistence whereby each stage of a persisting body is a numerically distinct expression of one and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> formal essence. This suggestion provides the different stages of a persisting body enough similarity for diachronic sameness (and thus persistence) while avoiding diachronic identity (which would be inconsistent with his temporal parts metaphysic of bodies). ...|$|R
