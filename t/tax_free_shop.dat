40|$|At {{the end of}} June 1999 the intra-EU duty <b>free</b> <b>shopping</b> was {{abolished}} {{among the}} fifteen member nations. The opponents of this resolution argued that such a tax-free sales sector created jobs EU-wide and hardly reduced the value added and excise tax revenue of individual countries. In their opinion, duty free trade not only contributed to the reduction of travel fare within the EU but could also be characterised {{as a supplement to}} the normal retail trade for some products. Such ‘old’ ideas are increasingly popular in some Eastern European EU candidates where they are preparing for the introduction of the Single Market and EU membership in the near future. This study primarily shows that the arguments mentioned above were neither significant enough nor conclusive to maintain the intra-EU duty <b>free</b> <b>shopping.</b> Furthermore, the abolition of such <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> sales was approved in the EU in order to ensure the allocation efficiency of the VAT and excise tax system within a single market. Several arguments against the intra-EU <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> shop-ping examined in the study provide some helpful policy orientations for EU membership candidates. ...|$|R

Compared to free trade, its welfare impact depends on the redistribution mechanism accompanying free trade. We show that with a Dixit–Norman <b>tax</b> scheme <b>free</b> trade is Pareto-inferior to a duty free zone regime. The opposite holds true for lump su...|$|R
