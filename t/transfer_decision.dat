40|$|Adjustable {{autonomy}} {{refers to}} agents' dynamically varying their own autonomy, <b>transferring</b> <b>decision</b> making control to other entities (typically human users) in key situations. Determining whether and when such transfer of control must occur {{is arguably the}} fundamental research question in adjustable autonomy. Practical systems have made significant in-roads in answering this question and in providing high-level guidelines for <b>transfer</b> of control <b>decisions.</b> For instance, [11] report that Markov decision processes were successfully used in <b>transfer</b> of control <b>decisions</b> in a real-world multiagent system, but that use of C 4. 5 led to failures. Yet, an underlying theory of transfer of control, that would explain such successes or failures is missing. To take a step in building this theory, we introduce {{the notion of a}} transfer-of-control strategy, which potentially involves several transfer of control actions. A mathematical model based on this notion allows both analysis of previously reported implementations and guidance for the design of new implementations. The practical benefits of this model are illustrated in a dramatic simplification of an existing adjustable autonomy system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{importance}} of respecting women’s wishes {{to give birth}} close to their local community is supported by policy in many developed countries. However, persistent concerns about the quality and safety of maternity care in rural communities have been expressed. Safe childbirth in rural communities depends on good risk assessment and decision making as to whether and when the transfer {{of a woman in}} labour to an obstetric led unit is required. This is a difficult decision. Wide variation in transfer rates between rural maternity units have been reported suggesting different decision making criteria may be involved; furthermore, rural midwives and family doctors report feeling isolated in making these decisions and that staff in urban centres do not understand the difficulties they face. In order to develop more evidence based decision making strategies greater understanding {{of the way in which}} maternity care providers currently make decisions is required. This study aimed to examine how midwives working in urban and rural settings and obstetricians make intrapartum <b>transfer</b> <b>decisions,</b> and describe sources of variation in decision making. Methods The study was conducted in three stages. 1. 20 midwives and four obstetricians described factors influencing <b>transfer</b> <b>decisions.</b> 2. Vignettes depicting an intrapartum scenario were developed based on stage one data. 3. Vignettes were presented to 122 midwives and 12 obstetricians who were asked to assess the level of risk in each case and decide whether to transfer or not. Social judgment analysis was used to identify the factors and factor weights used in assessment. Signal detection analysis was used to identify participants’ ability to distinguish high and low risk cases and personal decision thresholds. Results When reviewing the same case information in vignettes midwives in different settings and obstetricians made very similar risk assessments. Despite this, a wide range of <b>transfer</b> <b>decisions</b> were still made, suggesting that the main source of variation in <b>decision</b> making and <b>transfer</b> rates is not in the assessment but the personal decision thresholds of clinicians. Conclusions Currently health care practice focuses on supporting or improving decision making through skills training and clinical guidelines. However, these methods alone are unlikely to be effective in improving consistency of decision making. </p...|$|R

In categorizing the schools, I use the school categorization from 2005 / 06 data and do not update the school categorization in year 2006 / 07 (when teachers show up in their new schools).
