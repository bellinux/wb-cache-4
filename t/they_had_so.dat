5|$|After the king's victory, {{one of his}} loyal adherents, Thomas Szécsényi was {{appointed}} voivode who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king. In appreciation of the Transylvanian noblemen's services in the crushing of the revolt, Charles I exempted them from the taxes <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far paid to the voivodes.|$|E
5|$|While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept {{up their}} attacks outside Boonesborough, {{destroying}} the surrounding cattle and crops. With {{the food supply}} running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat <b>they</b> <b>had,</b> <b>so</b> in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, 1778, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned {{the next day with}} Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.|$|E

25|$|After The Alliance was disbanded, the WWF {{was faced}} with a title crisis; that is, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many championships (due to them {{acquiring}} all of WCW's championships), each individual title became devalued.

First, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (simply renamed the World Championship) was unified with the WWF Championship to form the Undisputed WWF Championship.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1994 season, San Diego was not {{expected}} to do well because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many newcomers via the draft and free agency; the Chargers ended up with 22 new players on their roster, and 10 of them became starters. However, they ended up winning their first six regular season games en route to an 11–5 record, the AFC West championship, and the #2 AFC playoff seed. The Chargers went into the final game of the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers needing a win to get the #2 seed (a loss would have given that spot to the Miami Dolphins), which came with a first-round bye and a home game in the divisional round of the playoffs. Backup quarterback Gale Gilbert, subbing for injured starter Stan Humphries, led the Chargers to a come-from-behind 37–34 win, with John Carney kicking a game-winning field goal in the game's final seconds.|$|E
500|$|Herman Raucher {{wrote the}} film script in the 1950s {{during his tenure}} as a {{television}} writer, but [...] "couldn't give it away." [...] In the 1960s, he met Robert Mulligan, best known for directing To Kill a Mockingbird. Raucher showed Mulligan the script, and Mulligan took it to Warner Bros., where Mulligan argued the film could be shot for the relatively low price of $1 million, and Warner approved it. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> little faith in the film becoming a box-office success, though, they shied from paying Raucher outright for the script, instead promising him {{ten percent of the}} gross.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the vocal}} {{sessions}} {{took place in}} Paris, whereas the rhythm sections were recorded in the United States. The album incorporates a variety of accompanying performances including a horn section, woodwind instruments, a string orchestra and choir. Orchestral parts in particular were recorded for almost every track, but were only included on a few songs in the final product. The use of such performers and places came at great monetary expense, as noted by Bangalter: [...] "There {{used to be a}} time where people that had means to experiment would do it, you know? That's what this record is about." [...] He estimated a cost of over one million dollars, but felt that the number was not important. Bangalter stated that the sessions were financed by Daft Punk themselves, which allowed them the luxury of abandoning the project if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> wished. He also specified that [...] "there are songs on the album that traveled into five studios over two and a half years." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1943 {{a policy}} change was mooted to remove female {{officers}} from the technical musterings <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these roles. In opposing this, Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore John McCauley. She told McCauley, [...] "I contend {{that it is a}} waste of money and training to take women cipher officers, women from Signals (S4) and casualty... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job", and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions, and not simply for administration and welfare. McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to Air Vice Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones backed Lukis' authority, and the latter sent what Joyce Thomson described as a [...] "stinging rebuke" [...] to Stevenson, who was forced to apologise. In any event, women officers continued to be employed in technical positions as the WAAAF expanded over the next two years, peaking in strength at 18,667 members in October 1944. As of July that year, women comprised thirty-one per cent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one trades, all previously occupied by men. By {{the end of the war}} around 27,000 women had served in the WAAAF.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{three new}} songs: [...] "Oh Bubblegum", [...] "Nuts", and the titular [...] "Remember You". Sugar composed {{the music for}} all four, and wrote the lyrics (Sanchez co-wrote the lyrics for [...] "Oh Bubblegum"). Sugar recorded demos for the songs and Rob Sugar, Rebecca's father, released the three new demos on his official YouTube account. For the demo for [...] "I Remember You", Sugar recorded vocals over a separate track of her playing an omnichord; Sugar's ominchord playing was eventually worked directly into the episode. According to Rob, the [...] "off-key notes were accidents of running out of power—it {{took a lot of}} tries to make it happen on cue." [...] While Sugar was pitching the song, she played her songs but her omnichord started to lose power. Sugar and the crew realized that the sound of the omnichord losing power fit with the mood of the episode. For the eponymous song, Sugar noted that it [...] "was so amazing to work with Olivia Olson and Tom Kenny on the songs for this episode, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much chemistry in the booth together!" [...] She wrote that she constructed the episode to [...] "do them justice." [...] Olson noted that, despite the sad themes featured in the installment, recording the dialogue with Kenny and music for the episode was a fun experience. While the two were recording, Olson had to sing Kenny his melodies; Kenny would then parrot the lines back in the voice of the Ice King.|$|E
