5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, in stark contrast to the band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> beauty of a beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|Much {{commentary}} {{has focused}} on the novel's depiction of njais, a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes the novel as an ode to njais, citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept njais, showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this was manifested in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed njai (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the njai within the story, considering the novel to be an ode to <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> loyalty of the concubines.|$|E

5|$|The eponymous {{protagonist of}} the series is Septimus Heap. As the seventh son of a seventh son, the aptly named Septimus has {{exceptional}} magical powers. He shares his birthday with Jenna, his adoptive sister, but is presumed dead at birth by his family. For most of the first novel he appears as Boy 412, a child from the Young Army, where he has spent the first ten {{years of his life}} after DomDaniel attempted to abduct him. Thereafter he is apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand. He has a mop of curly hair, wears green apprentice robes and has a Dragon Ring on his right hand. In the second novel, he acquires a dragon called Spit Fyre as a pet. According to a review in the Manila Standard Today, the contrast between the caution he has learned from an early age and his longing for <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> affection of a family makes him an intriguing character.|$|E
5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E

25|$|Sex is not {{considered}} acceptable outside marriage, {{but it is an}} important part of <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> care shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E

There are also several days throughout the year that are set aside for general commemoration of the departed, sometimes including nonbelievers. These days usually fall on a Saturday, since it was on a Saturday that Christ lay in the Tomb.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} Diwali, is celebrated as Padwa. This day ritually celebrates <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> mutual devotion between {{the wife and}} husband. The husbands give {{thoughtful}} gifts, or elaborate ones to respective spouses. In many regions, newly married daughters with their husbands are invited for special meals. Sometimes brothers go and pick up their sisters from their in-laws home for this important day.

25|$|The {{last day}} of the festival is called Bhai dooj (Brother's second) or Bhai tika in Nepal, where it is the major day of the festival.

The day ritually emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> lifelong bond between siblings. It is a day when women and girls get together, perform a puja with prayers for the well being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of food-sharing, gift-giving and conversations. In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters, or bring over their sister's family to their village homes to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.|$|E
25|$|In Achaemenid Persia, the lie, drauga (in Avestan: druj), is {{considered}} to be a cardinal sin, and it was punishable by death in some extreme cases. Tablets discovered by archaeologists in the 1930s at the site of Persepolis give us adequate evidence about <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>and</b> veneration for the culture of truth during the Achaemenian period. These tablets contain the names of ordinary Persians, mainly traders and warehouse-keepers. According to Professor Stanley Insler of Yale University, as many as 72 names of officials and petty clerks found on these tablets contain the word truth. Thus, says Insler, we have Artapana, protector of truth, Artakama, lover of truth, Artamanah, truth-minded, Artafarnah, possessing splendour of truth, Artazusta, delighting in truth, Artastuna, pillar of truth, Artafrida, prospering the truth and Artahunara, having nobility of truth.|$|E
