5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder in the sense that they added new scenes not included in the book <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> the source material.|$|E
5|$|After a brief intermission, {{the second}} act was started by {{arrangements}} of pieces from The Last Story, Final Fantasy XIV and Blue Dragon. The Blue Dragon piece featured a violin performance by Juraj Čižmarovič, who also performed at the Symphonic Legends concert. They were followed by a suite of music from Lost Odyssey <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> {{the second half of}} the concert, which lasted twenty minutes. The concert was extended by two encore performances featuring Benyamin Nuss on piano; the first was an arrangement from Final Fantasy X, and the second a suite of battle music from Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E

Haddou took fifth {{in a field}} sprint at the Châteauroux Classic, behind 's Anthony Ravard. Voeckler took a podium finish at the GP Ouest-France. 's Grega Bole broke away in the final kilometer to win the race, and Simon Gerrans and Voeckler tried to bridge up to him. Though everyone in the peloton had the same time at the finish, Bole, Gerrans, and Voeckler finished {{just ahead of the}} main field, in that order <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> the podium. Voeckler also turned in the team's best ride at the Tour de la Somme, finishing ninth in the field sprint. At the Tour de Vendée, which took place not far from the team's headquarters, they had two riders take top-ten placings, Charteau in sixth and Quemeneur in seventh.|$|E
5|$|Ely was {{enrolled}} at Washington High School in Portland, Oregon. He {{did not play}} in the school band, but had a passion for singing. In 1959, Lynn Easton's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton on the drum kit. The two teenagers grew up together, as their parents were close friends. Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> a band. They called themselves The Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group. The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermaket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist. Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{enhanced}} the Furs' sound by adding new elements to their musical arrangements – {{along with his}} own varied musical contributions, Rundgren brought in session musicians to augment the band. Gary Windo was a renowned saxophonist in the jazz world who had in recent years collaborated with major rock acts like Ian Hunter and Nick Mason. Extra horn work was contributed by Donn Adams, a longtime player with the American blues-rock band NRBQ. A classical cellist, Ann Sheldon, was recruited from the Royal College of Music. Lastly, the seasoned pop backing vocal team of Flo & Eddie were called by Rundgren <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> many of the songs. The instrumentalists had all been accepted by the band willingly, even enthusiastically – the backing vocalists, however, were another matter.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Morris {{has said}} that even without Curtis's suicide, it was {{unlikely}} that Joy Division would have endured as they were. The members of Joy Division had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would change the name of the group. Eventually renaming themselves New Order, the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> the line-up as keyboardist and second guitarist. Starting as a member of punk group The Inadequates, Gilbert had become friends with the band's members and had played guitar at a Joy Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.|$|E
5|$|Later, in December 1942, the 27th Battalion was {{transferred}} from the 3rd Brigade to the 23rd Brigade. This unit had previously been a 2nd AIF unit, but the loss of several of its battalions when they had been deployed to Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, had resulted in it being re-formed with Militia battalions and the 27th joined the 7th and 8th Battalions <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> its establishment. In March 1943, after having endured several bombings by Japanese aircraft since their arrival in Darwin the previous year, the battalion was replaced in the Darwin garrison and its personnel returned Adelaide for leave. In December, they regrouped on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland for jungle training, as the 23rd Brigade—then part of the 3rd Division—was converted to the jungle establishment, in preparation for them undertaking active service in New Guinea. Around this time the battalion was gazetted as an AIF battalion, meaning that because more than 65 per cent of its personnel had volunteered for service outside of Australian territory, it could be deployed beyond the limits {{set out in the}} Defence Act (1903).|$|E

Rhino joined Team Cage on the March 20 episode of Impact!. On the March 27 episode of Impact!, Sting joined Team Cage, <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> the team. It was announced on the April 3 episode of Impact! that each team captain would be allowed to add another member, making it a five-on-five match at Lockdown. James Storm was added to Team Tomko during the show, while Matt Morgan aligned with Team Cage. This contest was the result of an existing feud pitting Cage against Tomko and Styles. Cage, Tomko, and Styles were once united under the Christian's Coalition banner, until Styles and Tomko aligned with Angle and formed The Angle Alliance in late 2007. At TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008, Cage fought Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Styles interfered in the contest aiding Angle, costing Cage the title. Cage fought for the title against Angle again at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, however, Tomko interfered aiding Angle to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|The SuperSkills {{competition}} {{began with}} the Fastest Skater competition, where the competitors skated one lap around the rink. The winner of each round earned a point for their team. The opening round was skated backwards, followed by each team's rookie representative. Then two goaltenders skated off {{before returning to the}} traditional form. Following preliminary rounds the two fastest competitors from each team faced off in a final round, where Michael Grabner defeated Taylor Hall earning two points for Team Staal. The Breakaway Challenge featured six players (three from each team) taking four shoot-out attempts. Fans voted for the winner via text message. The winner earned four points for his team. Second place was awarded three points and third received one point. Alexander Ovechkin won by a wide margin defeating second place P. K. Subban by over 17 percentage points, it was the third consecutive win in the competition by Ovechkin. Loui Eriksson finished third <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>out</b> the point earners from the competition. The Shooting Accuracy featured two players shooting targets in the four corners of the net. Winners were determined by the fastest player to hit all four targets. Daniel Sedin hit all four targets on four shots in his first round setting the overall fastest time hitting them all in just 7.3 seconds.
