25|$|Gang wars: Battles with enemy gangs are {{prompted}} {{whenever the}} player ventures into enemy territory and kills {{at least three}} gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the territory will be won and fellow gang members will begin wandering the streets of these areas. The more territory owned by the player, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> that will be generated. Occasionally, the player's territory will come under attack from enemy gangs and defeating them {{will be necessary to}} retain these areas. Once all marked territories are claimed from one of the two hostile gangs for the protagonist's gang, the opposing gang can no longer attack. Once the player takes control of all the territories, none can come under attack.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of The Godfather IIs {{gameplay}} is extorting businesses. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with two red bars. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter fills {{up to the first}} bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the second red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, the amount of money paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the second red bar. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, hanging them off ledges, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of The Godfathers {{gameplay}} is extorting businesses. The player must extort business to earn enough respect to level up, to complete certain missions, and to earn money. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with a green bar and a red bar. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter fills up to the green bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, {{the amount of money}} paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the red zone. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them. In the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player will occasionally have the option of carrying out a favor for a business owner rather than intimidating them. This can involve carrying out a hit on someone, scaring someone, or going to a particular location at a particular time. If the player chooses to perform the favor, the amount of protection money paid by the owner will be maximized.|$|E

[...] Regardless of the floorplan, as interactive theater, there are features every strip club will have. They include: performers (strippers), a floor area where the customers will congregate, and some form of staging for the striptease performance.|$|E

2500|$|Having overseen Kaiser Permanente's {{successful}} transformation from Henry Kaiser's healthcare experiment into a large-scale self-sustaining enterprise, Keene retired in 1975. By 1976, membership reached three million. In 1977, {{all six of}} Kaiser Permanente's regions had become federally qualified health maintenance organizations. Historians now believe then-President Richard Nixon specifically had Kaiser Permanente {{in mind when he}} signed the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as the organization was mentioned in an Oval Office discussion of the Act, where John Ehrlichman characterized Kaiser's philosophy thus: [...] "All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> they make." [...] In 1980, Kaiser acquired a non-profit group practice to create its Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. In 1985, Kaiser Permanente expanded to Georgia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origins of}} the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 are {{presented}} using a taped conversation between John Ehrlichman and President Richard Nixon on February 17, 1971; Ehrlichman is heard telling Nixon that [...] "...the less care they give them, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> they make," [...] a plan that Nixon remarked [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "not bad." [...] This led {{to the expansion of}} the modern health maintenance organization-based health care system. [...] Connections are highlighted between Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the lobbying arm of the largest drug companies in the United States, lobbying groups in Washington D.C., and the Congress. [...] Hillary Clinton, a champion of the Clinton health care plan, is shown as a crusader for change, appointed to reform the health care system in the United States by her husband, newly elected President Bill Clinton. Her efforts are met with heavy-handed criticisms by Republicans on Capitol Hill, and right-wing media throughout the country, who characterize her plan as the harbinger of socialism. When she is defeated, her punishment is to [...] "never speak of it again while in the White House." ...|$|E
2500|$|From this {{increased}} interest {{in the nature of}} the Earth and its origin, came a heightened attention to minerals and other components of the Earth’s crust. Moreover, the increasing economic importance of mining in Europe during the mid to late 18th century made the possession of accurate knowledge about ores and their natural distribution vital. Scholars began to study the makeup of the Earth in a systematic manner, with detailed comparisons and descriptions not only of the land itself, but of the semi-precious metals it contained, which had great commercial value. For example, in 1774 Abraham Gottlob Werner published the book Von den äusserlichen Kennzeichen der Fossilien (On the External Characters of Minerals), which brought him widespread recognition because he presented a detailed system for identifying specific minerals based on external characteristics. [...] The more efficiently productive land for mining could be identified and the semi-precious metals could be found, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> could be made. This drive for economic gain propelled geology into the limelight and made it a popular subject to pursue. With an increased number of people studying it, came more detailed observations and more information about the Earth.|$|E

60|$|Ethelred the Unready {{was glad}} enough, I dare say, {{to be rid}} of this holy saint; but, left to himself, he was a poor weak king, and his reign was a reign of defeat and shame. The restless Danes, led by SWEYN, a son of the King of Denmark who had quarrelled with his father and had been banished from home, again came into England, and, year after year, {{attacked}} and despoiled large towns. To coax these sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them money; but, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> he paid, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> the Danes wanted.

25|$|The {{national}} debt of the United States {{is the amount}} owed {{by the federal government}} of the United States. The measure of the public debt is the value of the outstanding Treasury securities at a point of time that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies.
