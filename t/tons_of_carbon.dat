5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how moderate {{actions to}} slow atmospheric accumulation {{of greenhouse gases}} from fossil fuel use also could reduce conventional air pollutants in the United States. The benefits that result would be “ancillary” to greenhouse gas abatement. Moreover, the benefits would tend to accrue locally and in the near term, while benefits from reduced climate change mostly accrue globally and over a time frame of several decades or longer. The previous literature suggests that changes in nitrogen oxides (NOx) {{would be the most}} important consequence <b>of</b> moderate <b>carbon</b> policies. We calculate these changes in a detailed electricity model linked to an integrated assessment framework to value changes in human health. A tax of $ 25 per metric <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions would yield NOx related health benefits of about $ 8 per metric <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> reduced in the year 2010 (1997 dollars). Additional savings accrue from reduced investment in NOx and SO 2 abatement in order to comply with emission caps. These savings sum to $ 4 -$ 7 per <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> reduced. Total ancillary benefits of a $ 25 carbon tax are estimated to be $ 12 -$ 14, which appear to justify the costs of a $ 25 tax, although marginal benefits are less than marginal costs. At a tax of $ 75 per ton carbon, greater health benefits and abatement cost savings are achieved but the value of ancillary benefits per <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> reductions remains roughly constant at about $ 12. climate change, greenhouse gas, ancillary benefits, air pollution, co-control benefits, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, particulates, health...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} economic potential of agriculture {{to participate in}} greenhouse gas emission mitigation efforts. Major agricultural mitigation strategies are included simultaneously to capture interactions. Results indicate that agriculture's contribution to emission reduction may be substantial, but not sufficient {{to fulfill the requirements}} of the Kyoto Protocol, which are estimated to be in the neighborhood of 700 million metric <b>tons</b> (MMT) <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> equivalents by the year 2010. Even under extreme economic incentives, the annual emission reduction potential from U.

25|$|Daniel Nepstad, a Senior Scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center {{which focuses}} on {{tackling}} two deforestation issues in Brazil has demonstrated that Brazil's deforestation rates have been cut nearly in half in recent years {{through a combination of}} government intervention and economic trends. Since 2004 the country has established more than 200,000 square kilometres of parks, nature reserves, and national forests in the Amazon rainforest. These protected areas, if fully enforced, aim to prevent an estimated one billion <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> from being transferred to the atmosphere through deforestation by the year 2015. The academic evidence suggests that the creation of public lands, through the assignment of property rights, reduces incentives to deforest land for agricultural conversion and has contributed to reduction in land related conflict.|$|E
25|$|Each {{cremation}} uses about 28 {{gallons of}} fuel and releases about 540 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce ~270,000 <b>tons</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide. That’s more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and not cremating {{on the same day}} as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment though natural burials are also possible. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{social cost}} <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> – or {{marginal}} {{damage caused by}} an additional <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide emissions – has been estimated by a U.

That calculation, however, omits many of the biggest risks associated with climate change, and downplays the impact of current emissions on future generations. Our reanalysis explores the effects of uncertainty about climate sensitivity, {{the shape of the}} damage function, and the discount rate. We show that the social cost <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> is uncertain across a broad range, and could be much higher than $ 21 /tCO 2. In our case combining high climate sensitivity, high damages, and a low discount rate, the social cost <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> could be almost $ 900 /tCO 2 in 2010, rising to $ 1, 500 /tCO 2 in 2050.
