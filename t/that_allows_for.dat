Cane has noted that there are three views.

The third view takes a middle ground <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

5|$|The MAM is a {{critical}} signaling, metabolic, and trafficking hub in the cell <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> the integration of ER and mitochondrial physiology. Coupling between these organelles is not simply structural but functional as well and critical for overall cellular physiology and homeostasis. The MAM thus offers a perspective on mitochondria that diverges from the traditional view of this organelle as a static, isolated unit appropriated for its metabolic capacity by the cell. Instead, this mitochondrial-ER interface emphasizes {{the integration of the}} mitochondria, the product of an endosymbiotic event, into diverse cellular processes.|$|E

5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any benefits or flaws that may come from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> players to jump in and out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E

Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 adds support BT.2020 color space and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.|$|E

5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova {{must use}} stealth and darkness to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a cloaking device <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities. Nova is also equipped with thermal imaging goggles {{and a special}} EMP device for disabling electronic devices and vehicles. In addition to the focus on stealth elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova can engage in hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will hunt for the player, set up traps, and fire blindly to nullify Nova's cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded {{the breadth of}} the Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients was made possible due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's kitchen is modeled around a more flexible concept <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> a multiple work-flow operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen at the time was a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
5|$|The HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2. The {{first game}} follows {{the journey of}} the {{teenager}} Tidus who is transported {{to the world of}} Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers. Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve. The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus. It reintroduces the series' classic job system {{in the form of the}} Garment Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle. X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.|$|E
