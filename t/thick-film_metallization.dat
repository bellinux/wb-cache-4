40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructure and electrical properties of silver-based <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallizations</b> of silicon solar cells prepared by infrared firing processes has been investigated. The {{performance of the}} cells are shown {{to be dependent on}} several dynamical and diffusive phenomena. In particular, the sintering of silver grains, silver diffusion into the glass, and the flow of glass at the metal/silicon interface strongly affect important characteristics of the cells such as sheet and contact resistivities and the adhesion of fingers and bus bars. The existance of an optimum value of the peak firing temperature is observed and explained in terms of competitive phenomena occurring at the metal/silicon interface. Moreover it is shown that IR firing treatments require a careful consideration of the sequence of printing and firing steps.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} ceramic substrates and <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallization</b> based packaging {{technologies in}} development for 500 C silicon carbide (SiC) electronics and sensors. Prototype high temperature ceramic chip-level packages and {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) based on ceramic substrates of aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) and aluminum nitride (AlN) have been designed and fabricated. These ceramic substrate-based chip-level packages with gold (Au) <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallization</b> have been electrically characterized at temperatures up to 550 C. The 96 alumina packaging system composed of chip-level packages and PCBs has been successfully tested with high temperature SiC discrete transistor devices at 500 C for over 10, 000 hours. In addition to tests in a laboratory environment, a SiC junction field-effect-transistor (JFET) with a packaging system composed of a 96 alumina chip-level package and an alumina printed circuit board was tested on low earth orbit for eighteen months via a NASA International Space Station experiment. In addition to packaging systems for electronics, a spark-plug type sensor package based on this high temperature interconnection system for high temperature SiC capacitive pressure sensors was also developed and tested. In order to further significantly improve the performance of packaging system for higher packaging density, higher operation frequency, power rating, and even higher temperatures, some fundamental material challenges must be addressed.

Prototype high temperature ceramic chip-level packages and {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) based on ceramic substrates of aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) and aluminum nitride (AlN) have been designed and fabricated. These ceramic substrate-based chip-level packages with gold (Au) <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallization</b> have been electrically characterized at temperatures up to 550 C. A 96 % alumina based edge connector for a PCB level subsystem interconnection has also been demonstrated recently. The 96 % alumina packaging system composed of chip-level packages and PCBs has been tested with high temperature SiC devices at 500 C for over 10, 000 hours. In addition to tests in a laboratory environment, a SiC JFET with a packaging system composed of a 96 % alumina chip-level package and an alumina printed circuit board mounted on a data acquisition circuit board was launched {{as a part of}} the MISSE- 7 suite to the International Space Station via a Shuttle mission. This packaged SiC transistor was successfully tested in orbit for eighteen months. A spark-plug type sensor package designed for high temperature SiC capacitive pressure sensors was developed. This sensor package combines the high temperature interconnection system with a commercial high temperature high pressure stainless steel seal gland (electrical feed-through). Test results of a packaged high temperature capacitive pressure sensor at 500 C are also discussed.

40|$|A high {{temperature}} n-channel 6 H-SiC metal semiconductor {{field effect transistor}} (MESFET) was fabricated, packaged, and electrically operated continuously at 500 °C for over 500 hours in an air ambient with less than 10 % change in operational transistor parameters. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of a semiconductor transistor operating in this harsh environment with excellent stability {{over an extended period of}} time. The fabrication process that enabled such stability in air atmosphere featured multiple levels of {{high temperature}} metal and dielectric passivation to prevent contamination (particularly oxygen) from reaching electrically sensitive interfaces. A <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallization</b> based ceramic package with conductive die attach material and Au wire bonds facilitated long-term testing under electrical bias at 500 °C. Over the course of the 500 hour operational test in air, the only observed degradation of transistor characteristics was increased leakage of the gate-channel diode as anneal time increased. This demonstration of 500 °C transistor durability represents an important step toward significantly expanding the operational envelope of sensor signal processing electronics for harsh combustion-engine environments...|$|E
40|$|NASA {{space and}} {{aeronautical}} missions for probing {{the inner solar}} planets {{as well as for}} in situ monitoring and control of next-generation aeronautical engines require high-temperature environment operable sensors and electronics. A 96 % aluminum oxide and Au <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallization</b> based packaging system including chip-level packages, printed circuit board, and edge-connector is in development for high temperature SiC electronics. An electronic packaging system based on this material system was successfully tested and demonstrated with SiC electronics at 500 C for over 10, 000 hours in laboratory conditions previously. In addition to the tests in laboratory environments, this packaging system has more recently been tested with a SiC junction field effect transistor (JFET) on low earth orbit through the NASA Materials on the International Space Station Experiment 7 (MISSE 7). A SiC JFET with a packaging system composed of a 96 % alumina chip-level package and an alumina printed circuit board mounted on a data acquisition circuit board was launched {{as a part of the}} MISSE 7 suite to International Space Station via a Shuttle mission and tested on the orbit for eighteen months.

40|$|High-temperature {{electronics}} and sensors {{are necessary for}} harsh-environment space and aeronautical applications, such as sensors and electronics for space missions to the inner solar system, sensors for in situ combustion and emission monitoring, and electronics for combustion control for aeronautical and automotive engines. However, these devices cannot be used until they can be packaged in appropriate forms for specific applications. Suitable packaging technology for operation temperatures up to 500 C and beyond is not commercially available. Thus, {{the development of a}} systematic high-temperature packaging technology for SiC-based microsystems is essential for both in situ testing and commercializing high-temperature SiC sensors and electronics. In response to these needs, researchers at Glenn innovatively designed, fabricated, and assembled a new prototype electronic package for high-temperature electronic microsystems using ceramic substrates (aluminum nitride and aluminum oxide) and gold (Au) <b>thick-film</b> <b>metallization.</b> Packaging components include a ceramic packaging frame, thick-film metallization-based interconnection system, and a low electrical resistance SiC die-attachment scheme. Both the materials and fabrication process of the basic packaging components have been tested with an in-house-fabricated SiC semiconductor test chip in an oxidizing environment at temperatures from room temperature to 500 C for more than 1000 hr. These test results set lifetime records for both high-temperature electronic packaging and high-temperature electronic device testing. As required, the thick-film-based interconnection system demonstrated low (2. 5 times of the room-temperature resistance of the Au conductor) and stable (decreased 3 percent in 1500 hr of continuous testing) electrical resistance at 500 C in an oxidizing environment. Also as required, the electrical isolation impedance between printed wires that were not electrically joined by a wire bond remained high (greater than 0. 4 GW) at 500 C in air. The attached SiC diode demonstrated low (less than 3. 8 W/mm 2) and relatively consistent dynamic resistance from room temperature to 500 C. These results indicate that the prototype package and the compatible die-attach scheme meet the initial design standards for high-temperature, low-power, and long-term operation. This technology will be further developed and evaluated, especially with more mechanical tests of each packaging element for operation at higher temperatures and longer lifetimes...|$|E
