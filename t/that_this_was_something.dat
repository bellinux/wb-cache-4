The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> only she and her brother could know about.|$|E
25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican {{with a picture}} of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour. From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> else. We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
25|$|Ancient sources mention {{what brought}} Pompey into the alliance, but are silent on what {{interests}} might have brought Crassus into the fold. There are only mentions of Caesar bringing Pompey and Crassus together, which Plutarch {{described as a}} reconciliation. Cassius Dio thought <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that required skill—almost {{as if it were}} a reconciliation of the irreconcilable. In the writings of Suetonius and Plutarch and in some letters and a speech of Cicero, we find clues about both what the interests of Crassus may have been, and indications that Crassus and Pompey might have been less irreconcilable that their portrayals suggest and that the three men of the triumvirate had collaborated before. It could be argued that the formation of the first triumvirate was the result of the marginalisation of an enemy (Caesar) and an outsider (Pompey) and the rebuttal of interests associated with Crassus by the optimates who held sway in the senate.|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} The Huffington Post, and Kevin O'Donnell of Spin magazine, noted that [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{features}} shout vocals and raw chanting.

[...] Kathy McCabe of Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph likened [...] "Run the World" [...] to [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and [...] "Diva" [...] (2009). Johnston Breihan of The Village Voice compared [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] to schoolyard chants, due to its [...] "cheer-team beats" [...] and the repetitive use of the word [...] "Girls".

500|$|After {{principal}} photography {{had finished}} for the episode, additional inserts were shot {{to add more}} variety to scenes featuring a lot of dialogue; Perry noted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> he had learned about from Wong and felt the technique was put to [...] "great use". Filming several of the episode's scenes, including the webcam feeds and footage Black watches of police officers investigating suspects was filmed in a deliberately low-resolution manner, on handheld cameras, as Perry felt footage that was too clean and high-quality would lessen the episode's tension, citing The Blair Witch Project {{as an example of}} how this approach has later been put to use. [...] "The Mikado" [...] featured Allan Zinyk's last appearance as Group member Brian Roedecker. Wong and fellow executive producer Glen Morgan wanted to sign Zinyk on for further appearances, but actor declined in order to pursue a career in the theatre in Toronto.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine met {{the album}} with a mixed to {{positive}} review. Cinquemani wrote that Kesha {{was able to}} pull off authentic and unapologetic lyrics with ease, noting <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> her pop-peers could not do. A complaint on the review was that the album was too similar to Animal, noting that she failed to [...] "branch out in any significant way" [...] and the overuse of processed vocals. Cinquemani ended the review praising the [...] "Animal (Billboard Remix)" [...] for its [...] "promise of something deeper, something beyond Dr. Luke's latest recycled formula." [...] Gary Graff from Billboard wrote [...] "Kesha sinks her teeth into some fresh flavors on Cannibal, which will certainly enhance her 'Animal' attraction." [...] Spin magazine's Barry Walters reviewed Cannibal with a mixed outcome giving the album five {{out of a possible}} ten stars. Walters criticized the album as a whole stating that it was full of contradictions, noting that on [...] "We R Who We R" [...] "she sends out pride vibes to bullied gays," [...] while on [...] "Grow a Pear", [...] "she emasculates a potential boyfriend." [...] The production of the album was stated as a positive, praising Dr. Luke for his consistent club-pop hooks and ability to [...] "render the hypocrisy [...] nearly irrelevant." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from The Boston Globe was mixed in his review of the album. Fekadu criticized the album's lyrical depth and use of auto-tune writing that the album was [...] "filled with vapid lyrics and battles any T-Pain album for most use of the auto-tune." [...] Kesha's mother, Pebe, was also targeted in the review criticizing her for helping write the album's title track, [...] "Cannibal" [...] which was called [...] "disturbing" [...] and [...] "sad".|$|E

The Royal Mint stated the new designs were [...] "reflecting a twenty-first century Britain". An advisor to the Royal Mint described the new coins as [...] "post-modern" [...] and said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that could not have been done 50 years previously.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

60|$|During {{the whole}} of this dialogue, Mr Chester had {{suffered}} nothing but his smile of unvarying serenity and politeness to appear upon his face.
