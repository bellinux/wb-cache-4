5|$|Virgil Earp {{picked up}} <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> he had {{retrieved}} from the Wells Fargo office earlier. He gave <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> to Doc Holliday who hid {{it under his}} overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return.|$|E
5|$|A movable {{cartridge}} {{guide was}} placed {{on the right side of}} the carrier block to prevent the escape of the shell when <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> was turned sideways in the act of loading.|$|E

5|$|In each of {{the cases}} above, the actual score is irrelevant; the {{projectiles}} simply have to hit the target sheet within the circles. Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. <b>The</b> <b>shotgun</b> is an exception to this, where only one round is allowed as a test shot.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 2009, in Michigan's {{season opener}} against Western Michigan, Robinson scored a {{touchdown}} {{on his first}} collegiate (fumbled) snap. As the ESPN television broadcast focused on his untied shoelaces, Robinson took the snap in <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> formation, ran to the right, broke a tackle at the 40-yard line, then cut left and ran 43 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 59 shots were fired. All shotgun rounds came {{from one of}} <b>the</b> <b>shotguns.</b> <b>The</b> other was a backup shotgun.|$|R

5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's account of what happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, except that he said he was the one, not Laura, who had objected to <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> being removed from the wall. He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E

50|$|The {{friends are}} arrested, but {{declared}} innocent after the traffic warden identifies Dog's dead crew {{as the prime}} suspects. Back at the bar, they send Tom out {{to get rid of}} the last piece of evidence connecting them to the case: <b>the</b> antique <b>shotguns.</b> Meanwhile, Chris arrives to give the friends back the duffel bag. He has taken all the money for himself and his son, and the bag is empty except for a catalogue of antique weapons. After leafing through the catalogue, the friends learn that <b>the</b> <b>shotguns</b> are actually quite valuable, and quickly call Tom. The film ends with Tom's mobile phone, situated in his mouth, ringing as he hangs over the side of a bridge, preparing to drop <b>the</b> <b>shotguns</b> into <b>the</b> River Thames, ending on a cliffhanger.|$|R
5|$|One episode {{includes}} a flashback to San Carlos de Bariloche, {{the location of}} the graduation trip (an Argentine prom tradition). Pablo Echarri made a guest appearance as the trip's coordinator, and fans of the show were selected in an internet competition to join the trip to Bariloche as extras. Another flashback features the Pumper Nic fast-food restaurant and a guest appearance by sportswriter Juan Pablo Varsky. Not all flashbacks are focused on the 1980s or high school; some are events from a character's adolescence, such as <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> wedding of Mar√≠a Laura and Pablo or her 15th birthday.|$|E
5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{barrel length}} was 30" [...] with 32" [...] {{available as a}} special order. In 1888 a 20" [...] barrelled version could be ordered and Winchester offered <b>the</b> <b>shotguns</b> with Damascus barrels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of <b>the</b> repeating pump-action <b>shotguns</b> in <b>the</b> 1890s {{led to their}} use by US Marines in the Philippines insurrections and by General [...] "Black Jack" [...] Pershing's pursuit of Pancho Villa, and [...] "riot" [...] shotguns quickly gained favor with civilian police units, but the modern concept of <b>the</b> combat <b>shotgun</b> was fully developed by the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. The trench gun, as it was called, was a short-barreled pump action shotgun loaded with 6 rounds containing antimony hardened 00 buckshot, and equipped with a bayonet. The M1897 and M1912 also could be slam fired: the weapon having no trigger disconnector, shells could be fired {{one after the other}} simply by working the slide if the trigger was held down. When fighting within a trench, <b>the</b> shorter <b>shotgun</b> could be rapidly turned and fired in both directions along the trench axis. <b>The</b> <b>shotguns</b> elicited a diplomatic protest from the German government, claiming <b>the</b> <b>shotguns</b> caused excessive injury, and that any troops found in possession of them would be subject to execution. The US Government rejected the claims, and threatened reprisals in kind if any US troops were executed for possession of a shotgun.|$|R

5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Chris takes {{a shotgun}} from his father-in-law's home and carries {{it to his}} office in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's {{building}} and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, who he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns he shoots her in the stairwell. Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found {{he was unable}} to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known. At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders. In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that he might not have had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from <b>the</b> <b>shotgun</b> pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the sport}} is popular {{with a wide variety}} of <b>shotgun</b> enthusiasts, <b>the</b> <b>shotguns</b> used do not fit an exact standard; however, every shotgun used for {{sporting}} clays must be capable of shooting two cartridges of 12 gauge or smaller. <b>The</b> most popular <b>shotgun</b> configurations are over-and-under, semiautomatic, and pump-action, using traditional cartridge shot sizes of 9, 8, or 7.5.|$|R
5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and is placed in <b>the</b> <b>Shotgun</b> Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap {{similar to the one}} used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as <b>the</b> <b>shotgun,</b> bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
