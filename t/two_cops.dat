500|$|... "X-Cops" [...] {{was filmed}} in Venice and Long Beach, California. When members of The X-Files staff asked Cops {{producer}} John Langley about a potential cross-over, {{the crew of}} Cops liked the idea and offered their complete cooperation. Gilligan was even invited to the shooting of an episode. Inspired by Cops, Watkins' directing style was unique for this episode. Watkins filmed some of the scenes himself, {{in addition to the}} shots caught by the usual camera operators of The X-Files. However, he also brought in Bertram van Munster, a cameraman for Cops, to shoot scenes to give the finished product an authentic feel. In an attempt at realism, other staff members from Cops participated in the production: Daniel Emmet and John Michael Vaughn, <b>two</b> <b>Cops</b> crew members, were featured during the episode's climax. During rehearsals, Watkins kept the cameras away from the set, so that when filming commenced, the cameramen's unfamiliarity would create the [...] "unscripted" [...] reality feel of a documentary. In addition, a Cops editor was brought in to insert the blur over the faces of bystanders.|$|E

2500|$|Brief vignettes {{featuring}} McKinney and McCulloch {{as a pair}} of Toronto {{city police}} officers, usually standing beside their squad car, making banal small-talk while rarely doing actual police work. One such sketch featured McKinney describing a homicide and police chase in technical detail, but it is revealed that he's describing a movie he saw (rather than an actual homicide), and has no idea what the story is with the actual dead body the <b>two</b> <b>cops</b> are standing over. The characters originated in the full-length sketch [...] "On the Run", in which the <b>two</b> <b>cops</b> try to pursue a group of escaped convicts without looking conspicuous. According to DVD commentary, McKinney and McCulloch, during a break in shooting that particular sketch, began to improvise several short scenes revolving around those two characters for fun; some of their improvisations were incorporated into the show, and proved so popular they became a fixture. The duo have the distinction of being the show's most frequently used recurring characters; they were also carried over into Brain Candy and Death Comes to Town.|$|E

[...] He described the film as a [...] "tapestry of ideas all related {{to some of the}} biggest issues that I think we're facing right now [...] [...] [...] alternative fuel or the increasing obsession with celebrity and how celebrity now intertwines with politics".
