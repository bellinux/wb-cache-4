25|$|Typical {{metamorphic}} mineralogy is tremolite-chlorite, or talc-chlorite mineralogy in {{the upper}} spinifex zones. The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base facies tend {{to be free from}} <b>tremolite</b> and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- anthophyllite if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated. The upper flow facies tend to be dominated by talc, chlorite, <b>tremolite,</b> and other magnesian amphiboles (anthophyllite, cummingtonite, gedrite, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Amphibole class fibers are needle-like. Amosite, crocidolite, <b>tremolite,</b> {{anthophyllite}} and actinolite {{are members}} of the amphibole class.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tremolite</b> Asbestos Registry {{contains}} {{people who}} lived in or worked in Libby, Montana, while vermiculite was mined there; these people were at risk for exposure to the <b>tremolite</b> asbestos that was naturally occurring in the vermiculite. ATSDR began addressing public health concerns in Libby in 1999 and created the registry in 2004. The purpose of the registry was to monitor the long-term health effects of people in Libby exposed to <b>tremolite</b> asbestos and to assist with communicating important health information to registrants. Researchers have used the registry to study how asbestos exposure affects human health. This research has yielded several important findings. Registry data was used to conduct the first study of the relationship between asbestos exposure and respiratory problems in children. Another study using registry data found a significant relationship between asbestos exposure and death from cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|There {{are thus}} two main classes of {{metamorphic}} komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form {{a series of}} rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, magnesite or dolomite and <b>tremolite.</b> Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, brucite. Traces of talc, <b>tremolite</b> and dolomite may be present, as it is very rare that no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, anthophyllite, enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates.|$|E
25|$|Nephrite {{consists}} of a microcrystalline interlocking fibrous matrix of the calcium, magnesium-iron rich amphibole mineral series <b>tremolite</b> (calcium-magnesium)-ferroactinolite (calcium-magnesium-iron). The middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called actinolite (the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos). The higher the iron content, the greener the colour.|$|E
25|$|Other {{regulated}} asbestos minerals, such as <b>tremolite</b> asbestos, CAS No. 77536-68-6, Ca2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2; actinolite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-66-4, Ca2(Mg, Fe)5(Si8O22)(OH)2; and anthophyllite asbestos, CAS No. 77536-67-5, (Mg, Fe)7Si8O22(OH)2; {{are less}} commonly used industrially but {{can still be}} found in a variety of construction materials and insulation materials and have been used in a few consumer products.|$|E
25|$|The factor {{controlling}} the mineral assemblage is the partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} within the metamorphic fluid, called the XCO2. If XCO2 is above 0.5, the metamorphic reactions favor formation of talc, magnesite (magnesium carbonate), and <b>tremolite</b> amphibole. These are classed as talc-carbonation reactions. Below XCO2 of 0.5, metamorphic reactions {{in the presence of}} water favor production of serpentinite.|$|E
25|$|Talc can {{sometimes}} be contaminated with asbestos due to the proximity of asbestos ore (usually <b>tremolite)</b> in underground talc deposits. By 1973, US federal law required all talc products to be asbestos-free, and today there is strict quality control {{in the production of}} talc products, separating cosmetic-grade talc (e.g. talcum powder) from industrial-grade talc (often used in friction products) has largely eliminated this issue for consumers.|$|E
25|$|Although not all {{vermiculite}} contains asbestos, {{some products}} {{were made with}} vermiculite that contained asbestos until the early 1990s. Vermiculite mines throughout the world are now regularly tested for it and are supposed to sell products that contain no asbestos. The former vermiculite mine in Libby, Montana, did have <b>tremolite</b> asbestos as well as winchite and richterite (both fibrous amphiboles) — in fact, it was formed underground through essentially the same geologic processes as the contaminants.|$|E
25|$|One {{vermiculite}} mine {{operated by}} W. R. Grace and Company in Libby, Montana exposed workers and community residents to danger by mining vermiculite contaminated with asbestos, typically richterite, winchite, actinolite or <b>tremolite.</b> Vermiculite contaminated with asbestos from the Libby mine {{was used as}} insulation in residential and commercial buildings through Canada and the United States. W. R. Grace and Company's loose-fill vermiculite was marketed as Zonolite but was also used in sprayed-on products such as Monokote.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{tests in}} a {{certified}} asbestos-testing laboratory found the <b>tremolite</b> form of amphibole asbestos in {{three out of}} eight bigger brands of children's crayons that are made partly from talc: Crayola, Prang, and RoseArt. In Crayola crayons, the tests found asbestos levels from 0.05% in Carnation Pink to 2.86% in Orchid; in Prang crayons, the range was from 0.3% in Periwinkle to 0.54% in Yellow; in Rose Art crayons, it was from 0.03% in Brown to 1.20% in Orange. Overall, 32 different types of crayons from these brands contained more than trace amounts of asbestos, and eight others contained trace amounts. The Art and Creative Materials Institute, a trade association which tests the safety of crayons {{on behalf of the}} makers, initially insisted the test results must be incorrect, although they later said they do not test for asbestos. In May 2000, Crayola said tests by Richard Lee, a materials analyst whose testimony on behalf of the asbestos industry has been accepted in lawsuits over 250 times, found two of its crayons tested negative for asbestos. In June 2000, Binney & Smith, the maker of Crayola, and the other makers agreed to stop using talc in their products, and changed their product formulations in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|An area of [...] of {{the county}} {{is known to be}} {{underlain}} with natural asbestos. Much of the asbestos is known to emanate from fibrous <b>tremolite</b> or actinolite. [...] The threat was discovered in 1987, prompting the county to establish laws to monitor air quality at construction sites, control soil taken from affected areas, and require freshly developed sites to lay [...] of clean, stable material over the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Amphiboles {{including}} amosite (brown asbestos) and crocidolite (blue asbestos) were formerly used in {{many products}} until the early 1980s. [...] <b>Tremolite</b> asbestos constituted a contaminant of many if not all naturally occurring chrysotile deposits. The use {{of all types of}} asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in much of the Western world by the mid-1980s, and in Japan by 1995. [...] Some products that included amphibole types of asbestos included the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Other natural {{asbestiform}} minerals, such as richterite, Na(CaNa)(Mg, Fe++)5(Si8O22)(OH)2, and winchite, (CaNa)Mg4(Al, Fe3+)(Si8O22)(OH)2, {{though not}} regulated, are said {{by some to}} be no less harmful than <b>tremolite,</b> amosite, or crocidolite. They are termed [...] "asbestiform" [...] rather than asbestos. Although the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not included them in the asbestos standard, NIOSH and the American Thoracic Society have recommended them for inclusion as regulated materials because they may also be hazardous to health.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vermiculite}} deposit at {{the mine}} in Libby, Montana, was (and is) heavily contaminated with asbestos. Numerous people were knowingly {{exposed to the}} harmful dust of vermiculite that contained asbestos. [...] Unfortunately, the mine had been operating since the 1920s, and environmental and industrial controls were virtually non-existent until the mine was purchased by the W.R. Grace Company in 1963. Yet, knowing the human health risks, the mining company still continued to operate there until 1990. Consequently, many of the former miners and residents of Libby have been affected and continue to suffer health problems. Over 400 people in the town have died from asbestos-related disease due to contamination from vermiculite mining from nearby Zonolite Mountain, where soil samples {{were found to be}} loaded with fibrous <b>tremolite</b> (known to be a very hazardous form of asbestos), and countless others there who insulated their homes with Zonolite have succumbed to asbestos-related diseases, most of whom never were employed in environments where asbestos was an issue.|$|E
2500|$|Amphiboles {{have great}} {{variability}} in chemistry, described variously as a [...] "mineralogical garbage can" [...] or a [...] "mineralogical shark swimming {{a sea of}} elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the 12−; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group (−), although it can {{be replaced by a}} fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion. Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+. Several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as asbestosis; amphibole asbestos (anthophyllite, <b>tremolite,</b> actinolite, grunerite, and riebeckite) are considered more dangerous than chrysotile serpentine asbestos.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tremolite</b> is {{a member}} of the {{amphibole}} group of silicate minerals with composition: ☐Ca2(Mg5.0-4.5Fe2+0.0-0.5)Si8O22(OH)2. <b>Tremolite</b> forms by metamorphism of sediments rich in dolomite and quartz. <b>Tremolite</b> forms a series with actinolite and ferro-actinolite. Pure magnesium <b>tremolite</b> is creamy white, but the color grades to dark green with increasing iron content. It has a hardness on Mohs scale of 5 to 6. Nephrite, one of the two minerals of the gemstone jade, is a green variety of <b>tremolite.</b>|$|E
