One of the most important assays for measuring DSB in cellular DNA is filter elution.

Major assumptions of the analysis are reptation through a channel formed by surrounding strands, with only strand ends captured by filter pores. Both viscosity and entanglement with surrounding strands are considered to determine the resistance to this motion. One important result is that the average <b>elution</b> <b>time</b> of a strand depends not only on its length, but also on the size distribution of the surrounding strands. This model is consistent with experimental observations, such as the dependence of elution kinetics upon radiation dose, but independence from the size of the DNA sample up to a critical filter loading, and possible overlap of <b>elution</b> <b>times</b> for strands of different length.

Use of a reverse-phase capillary column coupled to a mass spectrometer allows for separation and analysis of serum as part of efforts to discover biomarkers. Even after sample simplification by organic solvent precipitation, data files for a single sample typically exceed one gigabyte, making it difficult to analyze complete serum mass spectrometry profiles with currently available software. However, with adequate safeguards, it appears possible to consider portions of mass spectra to find differences in peak intensities between clinical comparison groups visually.

40|$|Abstract Background Identifying {{corresponding}} features (LC peaks registered by identical peptides) {{in multiple}} Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) datasets plays {{a crucial role}} in the analysis of complex peptide or protein mixtures. Warping functions are commonly used to correct the mean of <b>elution</b> <b>time</b> shifts among LC-MS datasets, which cannot resolve the ambiguity of corresponding feature identification since <b>elution</b> <b>time</b> shifts are random. We propose a Statistical Corresponding Feature Identification Algorithm(SCFIA) based on both <b>elution</b> <b>time</b> shifts and peak shape correlations between corresponding features. SCFIA first trains a set of statistical models, and then, all candidate corresponding features are scored by the statistical models to find the maximum likelihood solution. Results We test SCFIA on publicly available datasets. We first compare its performance with that of warping function based methods, and the results show significant improvements. The performance of SCFIA on replicates datasets and fractionated datasets is also evaluated. In both cases, the accuracy is above 90 %, which is near optimal. Finally the coverage of SCFIA is evaluated, and it is shown that SCFIA can find corresponding features in multiple datasets for over 90 % peptides identified by Tandem MS. Conclusions SCFIA can be used for accurate corresponding feature identification in LC-MS. We have shown that peak shape correlation can be used effectively for improving the accuracy. SCFIA provides high coverage in corresponding feature identification in multiple datasets, which serves the basis for integrating multiple LC-MS measurements for accurate peptide quantification. </p...|$|R

However, the specificity of an LC-MS measurement depends upon the complexity of the proteome (i. e., the number of possible peptides) and the accuracy of the LC-MS measurements. In this work, theoretical tryptic digests of all predicted proteins from the genomes of three organisms of varying complexity were evaluated for specificity. Accuracy of the LC-MS measurement of mass-NET pairs (on a 0 to 1. 0 NET scale) was described by bivariate normal sampling distributions centered on the peptide signatures. Measurement accuracy (i. e., mass and NET standard deviations of ± 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 ppm, and ± 0. 01 and 0. 05, respectively) was varied to evaluate improvements in process quality.

Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low <b>elution</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{research}} {{that appeared to}} spark an onslaught of modified applications was a gel permeation chromatography technique of fixing poly(isopropyl acrylate) (PIPA) strands to glass beads and separating a mixture of dextrans, which was developed by Gewehr et al. They found that between the temperatures of 25-32 °C, the <b>elution</b> <b>time</b> of dextrans at different molecular weights exhibited a dependence on the temperature. Dextrans of the highest molecular weight eluted first since the PIPA chains exhibit hydrophilicity at temperatures below the LCST. As {{the temperature of the}} elution increased, when the chains behave in a more hydrophobic manner, the <b>elution</b> <b>times</b> increased for each of the analytes for the given range. The trend generally applies over the entire temperature range, but there is a flattening of the curve before 25 °C and after 32 °C (the approximate LCST for this experiment). It {{is important to note that}} above the LCST, the PIPA acts as a typical nonpolar stationary phase that would be used in reverse-phased chromatography. There are also instances of the <b>elution</b> <b>times</b> increasing below 15 °C, which most likely can be attributed to the lower temperatures’ effects on mass transfer playing a more significant role on retention than the stationary phase behavior. This study showed that the resolution could essentially be tuned by adjusting the operating temperature. The scope of this study was limited to isothermal conditions and attaching polymer chains to glass beads. The results, however, were satisfying enough to inspire other investigations and modifications to create a more versatile stationary phase for the advancement of chromatography.|$|R
30|$|The amylose {{content of}} samples was {{determined}} by analysing debranched starches using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with Ultrahydrogel (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) as described previously (Butardo et al. 2011). Pullulan standards (Shodex P- 82) calibrated with the Mark–Houwink–Sakaruda equation {{were used for the}} estimation of the molecular weight from the <b>elution</b> <b>time</b> (Castro et al. 2005; Ward et al. 2006). Samples were prepared and analysed in triplicate.|$|R
