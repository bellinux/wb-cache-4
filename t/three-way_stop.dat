40|$|The {{current study}} is an {{acoustic}} {{investigation of the}} three-way obstruent contrast between voiceless aspirated, voiceless unaspirated and voiced stops in the medial position of tone sandhi domains in Lili Wu Chinese, a language that has an aspiration-induced tonal split in lexical tones. The main focus of the thesis {{was to examine the}} acoustic realizations of the <b>three-way</b> <b>stop</b> contrast. By analyzing acoustic data from twenty old-generation Lili Wu native speakers, we found that f 0 perturbation was employed by speakers to contrast phonological voicing: voiced stops introduced lower f 0 contours to the following vowels than the voiceless ones. Durational data on consonant release (c/v ratio) and difference in phonation types (H 1 *-H 2 *) were adopted as two cues to contrast aspiration: voiceless aspirated stops tend to be associated with greater c/v ratio and H 1 *-H 2 * differences than voiceless unaspirated ones...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates supralaryngeal articulatory {{characteristics}} of denti-alveolar (coronal) stops /t, th, t* / and /n / in /aCa / context in Seoul Korean. An Electromagnetic Articulograph (EMA, Carstens) {{was used to}} explore kinematics of the consonants by examining the kinematic data of the tongue tip (the primary articulator for the coronal consonants), along with some additional supplementary position data of the tongue body, the tongue dorsum and the jaw. The {{results showed that the}} constriction duration was the most robust articulatory correlates of the <b>three-way</b> <b>stop</b> contrast with a pattern of /t/</th/</t*/. The contrast was further reinforced by the tongue body position (higher for /th, t*/) and the tongue tip opening displacement (less displaced for /th, t*/). The articulation of /n / was quite {{similar to that of the}} lenis /t / in terms of the constriction duration, and it was different from the oral stops in that it was produced with larger tongue tip displacement and lower jaw position than the oral stops, indicating its weak articulatory nature. The results are also discussed in comparison with those of bilabial stops with implications that the three-way contrast may be kinematically expressed differently depending on the physiological constraints imposed on the primary articulator (the tongue tip versus the lips). The present study, therefore, provides new articulatory (kinematic) data of denti-alveolar consonants in Korean, and demonstrates that the three-way stops, that have been known to differ primarily in their laryngeal settings, are indeed produced with kinematic distinctions at the supralaryngeal level...|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of Korean's <b>three-way</b> voiceless <b>stop</b> contrast {{depends on the}} combination of a number of acoustic properties including closure duration, f 0, VOT and spectral slope. Production studies indicate that these same properties systematically vary according to a stop's position in the hierarchical prosodic structure of an utterance. This study investigated interactions between prosodic structure and the recognition of tense, lax and aspirated stops by using stimuli that contained stops produced at one position in the prosodic hierarchy cross-spliced into utterances at a different prosodic level. The results of the experiment showed that recognition of tense and aspirated stops remained high regardless of the degree of mismatch between the underlying prosodic position of a segment and the domain into which it was inserted. Misrecognition rates were higher for cross-spliced lax stops, and underlying Utterance and Intonation Phrase initial lax stops spliced into the syllable level were perceived as aspirated by a majority of listeners. These findings are interpreted in terms of Cho & Keating's (2001) study of domain-initial strengthening and the acoustic overlap that is observed between stop manner and prosodic position. These results are taken as preliminary evidence that could support Cho & Keating's (2001) suggestion that prosodically conditioned acoustic differences aid listeners in discerning intended phrasings...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the relative contributions of spectral and temporal infor-mation to Korean phoneme recognition and to compare them with those to English pho-neme recognition. Eleven normal-hearing Korean-speaking listeners participated in the study. Korean phonemes, including 18 consonants in a /Ca / format and 17 vowels in a /hVd/ format, were processed through a noise vocoder. The spectral information was controlled by varying the number of channels (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16) whereas the temporal infor-mation was controlled by varying the lowpass cutoff frequency of the envelope extractor (1 to 512 Hz in octave steps). A total of 80 vocoder conditions (8 numbers of channels × 10 lowpass cutoff frequencies) were presented to listeners for phoneme recognition. While vowel recognition depended on the spectral cues predominantly, a tradeoff between the spectral and temporal information was evident for consonant recognition. The overall con-sonant recognition was dramatically {{lower than that of}} English consonant recognition under similar vocoder conditions. The complexity of the Korean consonant repertoire, the <b>three-way</b> distinction of <b>stops</b> in particular, hinders recognition of vocoder-processed phonemes...|$|R
40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} collect electromyographic signals from the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the larynx, {{as well as from}} the orbicularis oris superior, during the production of three classes of voiceless stop consonants: unaspirated, aspirated, and glottalized. Two phoneticians, both nonnative speakers of ejectives, produced the three classes of stops. The unaspirated stops are characterized by simultaneous voice onset, while the aspirated and glottalized stops both have long voicing lags. ^ The results of an analysis of two of the experiments are reported. The aim of the analysis was to isolate (1) patterns of muscle activity which are common to all three classes of homorganic stops, and (2) patterns which distinguish the three classes from each other. The orbicularis oris muscle shows greater activity for labial ejectives (glottalized stops) than for the other two classes. Acceptable recordings were obtained from three intrinsic laryngeal muscles, the interarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, and vocalis muscles. The interarytenoid is inactive during oral closure for all three classes, but it is markedly suppressed for the aspirated stops. It is more active for the onset of voicing following an aspirated stop. Vocalis activity parallels that of the interarytenoid for unaspirated and aspirated stops. For ejectives, the vocalis and lateralis are both especially active during oral closure, and their activity subsides after oral release. By contrast, the interarytenoid is inactive during oral closure for ejectives, and its activity peaks following release for the onset of voicing. Attempts to record from the posterior cricoarytenoid and cricothyroid were unsuccessful. ^ Bolivian Quechua is one language that makes use of these three particular classes of voiceless stops to effect linguistic distinctions. Although the results of this study do not necessarily indicate the manner in which a Quechua speaker 2 ̆ 7 s larynx operates in producing this <b>three-way</b> <b>stop</b> distinction, it is possible to state that this way of manipulating the larynx is one way of producing the phonetic categories of unaspirated, aspirated, and glottalized stops, such as those found in Bolivian Quechua. ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to examine if there is a word superiority effect on {{perception}} of <b>three-way</b> contrast of <b>stops</b> in Taiwan Southern Min (TSM). Based on Ganong’s (1980) findings that English participants showed a significant lexical effect in phonetic perception, I hypothesize that there exists a difference in perception between real words and nonwords in TSM. The prediction is that the categorical boundary shifts as lexical status plays a role in perception of stops. Experiment 1 was conducted as a neutral set of perception of TSM bilabial stops b-p-p h. In experiment 2, cases of “nonword-word-nonword ” set along the b-p-p h continuum were conducted. Results showed that real words corresponded to a wider range of VOT in the continuum compared to the neutral pattern. The categorical boundaries (both between /b / and /p / and between /p / and /p h /) were found to shift away from the real word sides towards the nonword sides. The lexical effect may be explained by parallel processing in which a higher level of processing (lexical level) interacts with a lower level (phonemic level) in speech perception...|$|R

The first experiment examines the maintenance of a <b>three-way</b> oral <b>stop</b> contrast in laryngeal setting across three generations of speakers. The results suggest that while the youngest generation of speakers generally patterns like the elder generations, there is an increase in the amount of variability in consonant production. Static palatography was employed for the second experiment to investigate a shift in place of articulation for the sibilant across two generations of speakers. The findings illustrate that the traditional palatalized retroflexed sibilant has been replaced by a fricative identical to American English /s/, causing interesting changes to a phonetically motivated allophonic pattern in the traditional form of the language. After considering the sound changes described in languages experiencing attrition, this paper concludes by arguing that sound change in obsolescing languages takes one of two predictable paths: approximation or transfer (terms originally applied to patterns of vowel mergers in Trudgill and Foxcroft (1978). Approximation, a type of change being experienced by the sounds examined in the first experiment, involves the expansion of phonological categories within the moribund language. Transfer, a type of substitution (e. g. Weinreich 1953; Thomason and Kaufman 1988), is exemplified by the second experiment where a dominant language phoneme replaces a similar sound in the obsolescing language. These types of changes, at least in their current state in Mono Lake Northern Paiute, do not cause neutralizations in the phonological system. This contradicts claims made by Andersen (1982), who argues that ultimate speakers of moribund languages fail to make phonological distinctions in the endangered language that are not supported by identical distinctions in the dominant language...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 30 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 11 - 14 July 2011 "Africa on the Move", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (2008) the third highest number of road fatalities (818 in 2007 - 08) in South Africa can be ascribed to "Failure to stop or yield". This follows behind pedestrian and overtaking related road fatalities. In {{a study of the}} minimum speed of vehicles through stop-controlled intersections during free-flow conditions it was found that very few drivers would come to a complete stop. Very high speeds were observed at some locations. Different types of layout were observed - such as two-way, <b>three-way</b> and four-way <b>stops,</b> with different available sight distances. At the same time a user survey was done by means of a questionnaire to determine the reasons why drivers do not stop at stop- controlled intersections. It was observed that nearly 90 per cent of road users do not come to a complete stop while less than eight per cent said in the user survey that they would always come to a complete stop. The 85 th percentile speed through these intersections was found to be 19 km/h. The paper describes the data collection, the results and discusses the possible reasons for non compliance of the traffic rules. Different solutions to this problem will be discussed. These include the increased use of yield signs, traffic circles and improved law enforcement. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.
