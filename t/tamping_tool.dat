40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{showing how}} to transform hydraulic systems of railway multi-actuator machinery characterized by inefficient state-of-the-art systems into the 21 st Century. Designing machines {{that are highly}} efficient, productive, reliable, and cost affordable represents the target of this research. In this regard, migrating from valve-controlled architectures to displacement-controlled layouts is the proper answer. Displacement-controlled systems remove the losses generated by flow throttling typical of conventional circuits, allow an easy implementation of energy recovery (e. g. during regenerative braking), and create the possibility {{for the use of}} hybrid systems capable of maximizing the downsizing of the combustion engine. One portion of the dissertation focuses on efficient propulsion systems suitable for railway construction and maintenance machines. Two non-hybrid architectures are first proposed, i. e. a novel layout grounded on two independent hydrostatic transmissions (HSTs) and two secondary controlled hydraulic motors (SCHMs) connected in parallel. Three suitable control strategies are developed according to the specific requirements for railway machines and dedicated controllers are implemented. Detailed analyses are conducted via high-fidelity virtual simulations involving accurate modeling of the rail/wheel interface. The performance of the propulsion systems is proven by acceptable velocity tracking, accurate stopping position, achieving regenerative braking, and the expected behavior of the slip coefficients on both axles. Energy efficiency is the main emphasis during representative working cycles, which shows that the independent HSTs are more efficient. They consume 6. 6 % less energy than the SCHMs working with variable-pressure and 12. 8 % less energy than the SCHMs controlled with constant-pressure. Additionally, two alternative hybrid propulsion systems are proposed and investigated. These architectures enable a 35 % reduction of the baseline machine’s rated engine power without modifying the working hydraulics. Concerning the working hydraulics, the focus is to extend displacement-controlled technology to specific functions on railway construction and maintenance machines. Two specific examples of complete hydraulic circuits for the next generation tamper-liners are proposed. In particular, an innovative approach used to drive displacement-controlled dual function squeeze actuators is presented, implemented, and experimentally validated. This approach combines two functions into a unique actuator, namely squeezing the ballast and vibrating the <b>tamping</b> <b>tools</b> of the work-heads. This results in many advantages, such as variable amplitude and variable frequency of the tamping tools’ vibration, improved reliability of the tamping process, and energy efficient actuation. A motion of the squeeze actuator characterized by a vibration up to 45 Hz, i. e. the frequency used in state-of-the-art systems, is experimentally confirmed. In conclusion, this dissertation demonstrates that displacement-controlled actuation represents the correct solution for next-generation railway construction and maintenance machines. ...|$|R
40|$|Repeated train loads produce {{settlements}} in railway tracks, particularly in ballasted trail tracks. When the settlement reaches the allowable limit, a maintenance method {{should be applied}} to bring the railway tracks into the original position. Settlements in railway tracks are hugely influenced by degree of ballast fouling (i. e., a ballast fouling index) in addition to train loads themselves (i. e., from large number of train passes). Sources of ballast fouling vary from ballast layer itself to underneath layers. Fouling materials coming from underneath layers {{is also an important}} source of ballast fouling in addition to particle crushing. Tamping method, stoneblowing and cleaning/replacement are the maintenance methods in practice currently. While replacement method is rarely applied due to huge costs and interruption to regular traffic, tamping method is applied throughout the world. However, tamping application induces particle crushing due to <b>tamping</b> <b>tools</b> in addition to loosening of top ballasts (i. e., thereby reducing original compaction level). Effect of tamping method on settlement characteristics haven’t been studied before. In this research, effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics of fouled ballast were studied conducting scaleddown model tests. Fouled ballast was simulated by gap-graded gradation curves with gravel (i. e., 1 / 5 size of actual ballast) and medium sand (D 50 = 1. 54 mm). In model tests, 100 loading cycles (no. of loading cycles were limited to 100 as this is a manual-controlled process) were applied to simulate cyclic behaviour with the designed vertical stress. After 100 loading cycles were applied, tamping method was simulated as in field conditions using a simple <b>tool.</b> After <b>tamping</b> application, again 100 loading cycles were applied with the same vertical stress. Continuous images were captured during each loading cycle to obtain strain distribution in ballast layer. The results revealed that settlement characteristics are influenced by degree of ballast fouling in addition to tamping application. As anticipated, the results suggested that settlement reduce after tamping application, mainly due to densification of specimen from previous 100 loading cycles. The results further revealed that the largest reduction in settlement occurs at 30 - 50 % of fouling index (FIP,m). Relationship of settlement ? no. of loading cycles was fitted as two processes; initial and residual settlement processes. The results suggested that initial settlement rate (?) becomes smaller after tamping application beyond 15 % of FIP,m. The results also suggested that residual settlement rate increases after taming application beyond 30 % of FIP,m. If results are interpreted in terms of practical application, {{it can be said that}} tamping application is effective only up to 30 % of FIP,m (which is equal to percentage of fouling materials for gadgraded sand-gravel specimens tested in this research). More detailed analysis on effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics were studied using strain distribution evaluated using the images captured during loading cycles in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) software (i. e., Flow-PIV). The PIV results confirmed that tamping application loosens top ballasts, particularly, at the sides of sleeper, where <b>tamping</b> <b>tools</b> are inserted. In next step, void ratio characteristics of sand-gravel specimens (simulating fouled ballasts) were evaluated in YADE (a DEM approach). In YADE, a method was proposed to produce gap-graded gradation curves. Verification of YADE simulations were done by the results of laboratory density tests. The comparison of results showed differences in void ratios (i. e., maximum and minimum void ratios). As laboratory materials consist of irregular particles and DEM simulations were conducted with spheres, the difference in void ratios is assumed to be due to different shapes of particles. Therefore, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced using the results of image analysis (i. e., in ImageJ) on shape characteristics of medium sand and gravel particles. Introduction of clump particles led to have similar results as those of laboratory void ratio characteristics. The results further revealed that variation of void ratios with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics with some accuracy. In next analysis, strength and deformation characteristics of fouled ballast were studied from triaxial compression tests. Triaxial compression tests were conducted in two series; dense and loose specimens simulated by 80 and 50 % of relative density, Dr respectively. The results from laboratory tests suggested that strength properties, represented by peak deviator stress, qf, and failure friction angle, ??f, change with FIP,m with some similarities with variation of ??with FIP,m. In next part, triaxial compression tests were conducted in DEM simulations with spheres. However, as comparison of DEM results with those of laboratory tests is influenced by particle shape, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced in DEM simulations. The results suggested that clump shape can simulate stressstrain behaviours same as laboratory triaxial compression tests. As different gradation curves can be simulated in YADE simulations, the method used can be extended to different type of fouled ballasts through different gradation curves. Also, it is also clear that variation of qf and ?f with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics (particularly, variation of ??) of fouled ballasts with FIP,m with some accuracy. In a simultaneous work, an in-situ method was proposed to evaluate particle size distribution of fouled ballast using image analysis techniques. ImageJ software was used to conduct image analysis. Particles (i. e., both gravel and medium sand) were simulated by different shapes in ImageJ and found the best available shape as ellipse shape to simulate laboratory particles. Gradation curves were evaluated as area-, number of particle- and volume-based gradation curves. Area-based gradation curve was possible to produce the gradation curve evaluated by sieve analysis test with some image analysis techniques. However, number of particles-based gradation curve underestimates that of sieve analysis. However, given both area- and number of particle-based gradation curves are not based on volume of particles (which is the case with sieve analysis test), a method was proposed to evaluate thickness of particles using 2 D images (hence, evaluation of volume of particle is possible). It was also discussed how definition of grain size should be used in image analysis results to compare with those of sieve analysis test. Finally, a simple method was proposed to evaluate volume-based gradation curve of fouled ballast using 2 D images using a size correction factor on grain size...|$|R
