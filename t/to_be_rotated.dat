5|$|Neutron {{interferometry}} {{has been}} used to investigate the Aharonov–Bohm effect, {{to examine the effects of}} gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
5|$|Royal Air Force policy {{required}} pilots <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> to home establishment for {{rest and}} instructional duties after nine to twelve months in combat. Promoted to captain in March 1918, Holden was posted to England in May as a flying instructor with No.6 (Training) Squadron at Minchinhampton. His unit {{was part of}} the 1st Training Wing, led by Lieutenant Colonel Watt, the former commanding officer of No.2 Squadron. Holden briefly took command of No.6 Squadron from 25 July to 11 August. He was awarded the Air Force Cross, promulgated on 3 June 1919, for his skill as an instructor.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|In 1926–1927, a royal {{commission}} into bribery {{of members}} of the police by bookmakers was conducted, finding that it was probable that two detectives and several plainclothes constables were guilty of taking bribes. After considering the report of the royal commission, Leane submitted his own report to the government, in which he criticised the vague nature of its findings, and while accepting that some police may have accepted bribes, he asserted that corruption was not widespread. One detective and three constables were offered the opportunity to resign and took it, and another plainclothes constable was returned to uniformed duty. During the course of the royal commission, several other plainclothes constables had resigned. Before the commission concluded, Leane recommended to the Chief Secretary, James Jelley, who was the minister responsible for the police, that the plainclothes branch of the police be abolished, with uniformed constables <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> through those duties as required. His recommendation was accepted. In January 1927, the design by Leane's brother-in-law, Louis Laybourne Smith, was selected for the National War Memorial in Adelaide. In early 1928, Leane became a foundation member and the inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen.|$|E

5000|$|Newton {{suggested}} {{the shape of}} {{the surface of the water}} indicates the presence or absence of absolute rotation relative to the fixed stars: rotating water has a curved surface, still water has a flat surface.

25|$|A 1988 {{commission}} considered Eggemoen as {{a potential}} site for a new main air station for fighter aircraft in Eastern Norway. Although it had sufficient area for construction, an air station {{would have to be}} built {{on both sides of the}} Randsfjorden Line. The proximity to Hønefoss and Jevnaker would incur high noise pollution. Investments would be high as the entire runway would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> ten degrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow both range and bearing to be {{measured}} at the same time, separate antennas, receivers, amplifiers and displays were needed. The antennas were mounted on triangular trusses mounted rigidly to a wooden cabin, in turn mounted on an AA gun carriage bearing system which allowed the entire cabin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> around the vertical axis. For tracking, the transmitter and receiver cabins were both {{turned to face the}} general direction of the target. The result was an unwieldy system of some complexity.|$|E
25|$|Antennae are {{generally}} sensitive to signals {{only when they}} have a length that is {{a significant portion of the}} wavelength, or larger. A common example is the half-wave dipole. For longwave use, this resulted in loop antennae tens of feet on a side, often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal. This presented a significant problem in arranging for the antenna <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated.</b> The US Navy overcame this problem, to a point, by mounting long antennae on ships and sailing in circles.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electrostatic}} generators {{are called}} friction machines {{because of the}} friction in the generation process. A primitive form of frictional machine was invented around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand.

Isaac Newton suggested the use of a glass globe instead of a sulphur one. Francis Hauksbee improved the basic design, with his frictional electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> rapidly against a woollen cloth.|$|E

25|$|Taildog {{was highly}} {{manoeuvrable}} {{through the use}} of thrust vectoring for all flight control. Vectoring was accomplished by rotating small vanes into the rocket exhaust. Six of these vanes were arranged as segments of a circle {{at the tail end of}} the missile body, where they were protected from the rocket exhaust. Each segment was pivoted at one end, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rotated</b> so the other end would be moved into the exhaust. The control system would activate the segment closest to the required change in direction. External aerodynamic surfaces were reduced to vestigial surfaces near the rear of the missile, and were unmovable.|$|E
