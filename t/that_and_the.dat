The Methodist congregation was successful for a time, with membership peaking at 572 members in 1873. It declined after <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> church ran into financial difficulties. In 1878 the congregation transferred ownership to the New York City Church Extension and Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.|$|E

However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. <b>That,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) was {{established}} in the area in 1963. <b>That</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> explosive growth of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s, caused the remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore to urbanize. The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. The communities around Clear Lake rapidly reoriented toward aerospace related industries, and the region's economy diversified further. Urban development spread solidly between Houston and the Bay Area communities. Houston formally annexed most of Clear Lake City in 1977 with Pasadena annexing most of the rest. Most of the other communities around the bay, however, had already incorporated, or incorporated soon afterward, and thus were independent of the metropolis. Texas State Historical Association.|$|E

On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall had a record-breaking season.

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is <b>that?</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> parent might respond, that is a zebra.

5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} solders, {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and the one with the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> low-bismuth solders about average. The acidification potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average.|$|E
