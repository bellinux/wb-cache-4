50|$|The People was an {{official}} {{organ of the}} Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP), a weekly newspaper established in New York City in 1891. The paper is best remembered {{as a vehicle for}} the ideas of Daniel DeLeon (1852-1914), the dominant ideological leader of the SLP from the 1890s until the time of his death. The paper became a daily in 1900, reverting to weekly publication in 1914 for budgetary reasons. Publication of the paper was moved to Palo Alto, California during its later years, finally <b>terminating</b> <b>publication</b> in 2008. Its 117 years of continuous publication make The People the longest running socialist newspaper in the history of American political radicalism.|$|R

5000|$|Littérature was a {{literary}} magazine edited by André Breton, Philippe Soupault, and Louis Aragon. Its first issue was published on March 19, 1919. Because of dwindling circulation, Breton decided to <b>terminate</b> <b>publication</b> after the August 1921 issue. In March 1922, however, he relaunched the magazine with the cover illustrating a Man Ray {{drawing of a}} shiny top hat, and the title, [...] "Littérature: New Series." [...] Breton remained {{the only one in}} charge of the review, after the departure of Aragon and Soupault, and to mark the review's change of direction, Breton decided to replace the cover image created by Man Ray with drawings - different each time - by Francis Picabia, to whom he gave carte blanche for each issue. Picabia drew on religious imagery, erotic iconography, and the iconography of games of chance.|$|R

500|$|Skylon has {{its origins}} within a {{previous}} space development programme for an envisioned single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane, known as HOTOL. In 1982, when work commenced on the HOTOL by several British companies, there was significant international interest {{to develop and}} produce viable reusable launch systems, perhaps the most high-profile of these being the NASA-operated Space Shuttle. In conjunction with British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce, a promising design emerged to which the British government contributed £2million towards its refinement; British engineer Alan Bond was amongst the engineers who worked on HOTOL. However, during 1988, the British government decided to withdraw further funding from the programme, resulting in development work being <b>terminated.</b> Aerospace <b>publication</b> Flight International observed that HOTOL and other competing spaceplane programmes were [...] "over-ambitious" [...] and that development on such launch systems would involve more research and slower progress than previously envisioned.|$|R

5000|$|The Prussian {{government}} never deployed Virchow {{to study}} the typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia in during 1847-1848. It was from this medical campaign that he developed his ideas on social medicine and politics after seeing the victims and their poverty. Even though he was not particularly successful in combating the epidemic, his 190-paged Report on the Typhus Epidemic in Upper Silesia in 1848 became {{a turning point in}} politics and public health in Germany. He returned to Berlin on 10 March 1848, and only eight days later, a revolution broke out against the government in which he played an active part. To fight political injustice he helped finding Die medicinische Reform (Medical Reform), a weekly newspaper for promoting social medicine, in July of that year. The newspaper ran under the banners [...] "medicine is a social science" [...] and [...] "the physician is the natural attorney of the poor". Political pressures forced him <b>terminate</b> the <b>publication</b> in June 1849 and became expelled from his official position. In November, he was given academic appointment and left Berlin for University of Würzburg to hold Germany's first chair of pathological anatomy. During his six-year period there, he concentrated on his scientific work, including detailed studies on venous thrombosis and cellular theory. His first major work there was a six-volume Handbuch der speciellen Pathologie und Therapie (Handbook on Special Pathology and Therapeutics) published in 1854. In 1856, he returned to Berlin to become the newly created Chair for Pathological Anatomy and Physiology at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University, as well as Director of the newly built Institute for Pathology on the premises of the Charité. He held the latter post for the next 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|By {{using these}} tactics, along with tricking Daniel into {{dropping}} an advertiser because of Alexis (which {{resulted in a}} major boycott against MODE), Wilhelmina had already started plans to destroy the magazine and the Meade family altogether by [...] "relaunching" [...] MODE as [...] "Slater" [...] Magazine. But after she was <b>terminated</b> from Meade <b>Publications,</b> Wilhelmina secretly unveiled a virus disk called [...] "Medusa X" [...] and wiped out the entire magazine's database. She then informed Daniel and Alexis she will launch [...] "Slater" [...] as MODE's new competitor and lured the MODE staff over to her side by offering benefits and incentives. Unfortunately, after seeing those plans fall apart {{due to a lack}} of finances (her father would not help fund the world that took his daughter away from him), she turns to another scheme, using the sperm of Bradford Meade so she can become pregnant and produce an heir that will give her a piece of the company, as it turns out moments after Bradford's death, she bribed a morgue doctor into acquiring the sperm, which can remain alive for 48 hours, before Bradford was embalmed.|$|R
40|$|In the Fall of 2009 Brill, {{confronted with}} budget challenges, chose to <b>terminate</b> its <b>publication</b> of Societies Without Borders: Human Rights and the Social Sciences. There were {{two ways to}} respond to this change: shop the journal to other {{publishers}} or look into a closer relationship with Sociologists Without Borders/ Sociólogos Sin Fronteras (SSF). The answer was clear almost immediately—we should look for a way for SSF to publish Societies Without Borders. This would free us from the tides of capitalism and allow SSF to push the boundaries {{of what it means to}} publish in academic journals. The first step for the new iteration of Societies Without Borders was the naming of a new editorial staff. Three co-editors, David L. Brunsma, Keri E. Iyall Smith, and Mark Frezzo guide the new journal with extensive assistance from our Editorial Collective. Members of the editorial collective offer leadership and guidance, in addition to offering thoughtful reviews of submitted articles. As both readers and authors they constructively contribute to, critique, and shape the new Societies Without Borders. It is with this first issue of Volume V that we are beginning to establish new norms of what it means to publish and read academic journal articles. Societies Without Borders is now open source—the content is freely available to all readers. The journal is solely published at www. societieswithoutborders. org, with subscription services and updates offered via email. Signing up for an email subscription allows readers to be notified when new content is available. Many double-blind, peer reviewed journals, like Societies Without Borders, have moved to the web to save production and printing costs. There are other advantages to the use of the web for publication. With assistance from Google translate, Societies Without Borders is now available in forty-nine languages. Using a blog format for the journal also allows for continuous dialogue about articles. Under each article, readers may click the “Leave a Comment” button to offer feedback to the author or ask a question of the community of readers. For authors this is an opportunity to learn how readers receive their work and for readers it is an opportunity to engage ideas in a more dynamic fashion. The use of comments will also create space for community to develop. In this way the journal is not only talking about human rights and social sciences, it is also a way of doing human rights as social scientists. In addition to changing the way we read and analyze content, Societies Without Borders is changing how we produce academic content. As well as the traditional article and book review formats employed by academic journals, the journal now offers three other ways to publish. In “Expressions of Human Rights” authors are invited to analyze, present, articulate, and express human rights in human societies in poetic or artistic works. Authors of “Living Human Rights” share a view of the ways that people around the world are demanding respect for their human rights. Research notes, commentaries, and shorter analyses and arguments are presented in “Notes from the Field. ” To maintain academic integrity, articles are double blind peer-reviewed, the editors review “Notes from the Field,” and jury of artists evaluates submissions for “Expressions of Human Rights. ” For Societies Without Borders to achieve its goal of being a journal of Human Rights and the Social Sciences, we rely upon you—the reader and author—to participate in myriad ways to make this a vibrant space. Our human rights city is unbound, but it can only thrive with active civic engagement. Join us...|$|R
