40|$|Conventional <b>threshold</b> models contain {{only one}} <b>threshold</b> variable. Such models are of limited {{economic}} application. This paper provides the theoretical foundation for <b>threshold</b> models with multiple <b>threshold</b> variables. The new model {{is much more}} complicated than a model with a single <b>threshold</b> variable as sev-eral novel problems arise with an additional <b>threshold</b> variable. First, models with multiple <b>threshold</b> variables cannot be con-verted into change-point models in the manner of Tsay (1998) and Hansen (1999). Second, asymptotic joint distribution of the <b>threshold</b> estimators may be ill-behaved should the <b>threshold</b> variables be dependent. Third, having more <b>threshold</b> variables introduces the curse of dimensionality to the estimation. In this paper, we establish the consistency of the <b>threshold</b> estimators. In particular, under certain conditions, we obtain the asymptotic joint distribution of <b>threshold</b> estimators and suggest a quick algorithm to estimate the <b>threshold</b> values. Tests for the number of <b>threshold</b> variables and their critical values are also developed. Asymptotic critical values of the LR type test for multiple <b>threshold</b> variables are computed.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{considers}} {{the appropriateness of}} a network survivability reporting <b>threshold</b> by investigating the optimality of different <b>thresholds,</b> and <b>threshold</b> types. The <b>threshold</b> in question was set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U. S. where a telecommunication outage affecting 30, 000 or more users for at least 30 minutes must be reported. Previous work has shown that this <b>threshold</b> masks considerable communications loss. Here, we dub this type <b>threshold</b> an AND <b>threshold,</b> and we investigate the optimality {{of a variety of}} different AND <b>thresholds.</b> In addition, we define here a PRODUCT <b>threshold</b> where the product of the outage size and the duration is a constant. The investigation is empirical, using over 19, 000 network outage events above and below the FCC reporting <b>threshold.</b> We wish to search for an optimal <b>threshold,</b> which minimizes the number of reports, and maximizes the amount of communication loss exposed by the reports. As a consequence we define here a <b>threshold</b> figure of merit, which is the ratio of the communications loss and the number outages exposed relative to the FCC <b>threshold,</b> and seek to maximize this metric. Findings are that the PRODUCT <b>threshold</b> is superior, and a specific <b>threshold</b> is identified as a candidate for further consideration. The FCC <b>threshold</b> is found to be 33 % from the optimal <b>threshold,</b> and to censor significant outliers. Based upon this work, the FCC may want to consider modifying the current reporting <b>threshold</b> to a PRODUCT <b>threshold.</b> 1...|$|R

25|$|Given its {{conservation}} throughout evolution, {{the action}} potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the conduction velocity can exceed 110m/s, which is one-third {{the speed of}} sound. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics. The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its <b>thresholding</b> to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, {{one that has been}} exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks.|$|E

40|$|We use {{the term}} "renal <b>threshold</b> for hemoglobin" to {{indicate}} the smallest amount of hemoglobin which given intravenously will effect the appearance of recognizable hemoglobin in the urine. The initial renal <b>threshold</b> level for dog hemoglobin is established by the methods employed at an average value of 155 mg. hemoglobin per kilo body weight with maximal values of 210 and minimal of 124. Repeated daily injections of hemoglobin will depress this initial renal <b>threshold</b> level on the average 46 per cent with maximal values of 110 and minimal values of 60 mg. hemoglobin per kilo body weight. This minimal or depression <b>threshold</b> is relatively constant if the injections are continued.
