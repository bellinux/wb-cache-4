Two-dimensional photographs may be inadequate for effective comparison of a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>mark</b> with a putative instrument. Taking a cast and producing a positive image results in a lasting three-dimensional record. This project aimed to develop and demonstrate the accuracy of an easy technique for production of long-lasting positive images (using plaster of Paris and dental alginate). Casts of facial features of embalmed cadavers were used to produce a positive image of the face (death mask). Measurements of distances between facial anatomical landmarks were compared with measurements of distances between the same landmarks on the death masks to assess accuracy of reproduction. There {{were no significant differences}} between cadaver and death mask in 6 of 9 measurements, indicating this technique has high accuracy with less mobile facial features, but produces deformation of pliable features...|$|E

First part of this work focuses on the questions regarding the registration requirements of the <b>three-dimensional</b> trade <b>marks.</b> The work looks closely on what constitutes a sign and which absolute grounds for refusal of registration are mostly employed when dealing with the <b>three-dimensional</b> trade <b>marks.</b> Furthermore this work looks at exclusion of registration of certain types of shapes, on the requirement of good faith when applying for trade mark registration and briefly at the average consumer. The landmark cases cited {{in this part of the}} work are Dyson v Registrar of Trade Marks, Philips v Remington, Henkel v OHIM, Lego v OHIM and Lindt v Franz Hauswirth. Second part of this work looks at the definition of design and its relationship to product itself.

50|$|The Carmelite altarpiece was a polyptych {{commissioned}} in 1329 for the Carmelite order monks. It {{consisted of}} a central panel depicting the Madonna and Child with St. Nicholas and Elijah. The side panels displayed St. Agnes, John the Baptist, Catherine, and Elisha. The predella below comprised five narrative paintings. Instead of taking their subject from the Bible, these five paintings show events {{from the history of}} the Carmelite Order. A striking feature of the overall design is the broad central panel of the predella, which allowed the painter to depict the consignment of the Carmelite rule in the early thirteenth century in a particularly detailed manner. The significance of Elijah in the Carmelite altarpiece is that Elijah was held to be the founder of the Carmelite order.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{capacity}} to confer ‘eternal’ protection on product shapes, <b>three-dimensional</b> trade <b>marks</b> seem to defy the basic tenets of intellectual property. Registration of such marks is therefore regularly subject to certain restrictions {{set forth in the}} law or developed by the courts. European trade mark law is no exception in that regard. While the CJEU insists that shape marks are to be assessed under the same principles as other forms of marks, obtaining protection in practice is quite difficult, which is only partially explained by the different perception of consumers. Furthermore, shapes are the only form of signs that is subject to an absolute and permanent exclusion from protection in order to safeguard competition interests. While the latter provision has been dormant in practice for most of the time, recent jurisprudence has given it more teeth; however, it has also rendered the contents of the provision and its relation to the other obstacles for protection more obscure, making it extremely difficult in practice to distinguish between the different categories. The article gives an overview on the legal situation and recommends a more transparent, balanced approach...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a number}} of {{workshops}} delivered to BA fine art students across all years and two institutions, this paper examines a selection of experimental results from participants. It also includes a discussion on the workshop methodology of spatial mark making and how this {{can be used as a}} tool for exploring surfaces, drawn interventions, and participatory group works. We ‘draw’ on surfaces but, by moving the ‘mark’ off that surface, and allowing it to be ‘seen’ in more than on space, there is a subtle (but noticeable) shift in the perceptual and conceptual analysis of these new marks. They exist in a ‘space’ between sculpture, installation and drawing. Their unfamiliar location offers an opportunity to look more closely – a state of ‘slow’ reading. Using light from lo-fi, semi-redundant sources, including 35 mm and overhead projectors, these workshops examine methods of manifesting marks on multiple translucent screens, existing architecture, smoke, columns of steam, clouds of water and rapidly oscillating webs manipulated in real-time by workshop participants. Many of the results experienced within the workshops are pseudo <b>three-dimensional,</b> creating <b>marks,</b> which appear to be solid and can be viewed from multiple angles. This raises questions about our perception of the ‘solid’ and the ‘flat mark’ as well as prompting discussions around validity of the process (particularly in fine art), the place of the spectacle in contemporary art practice and how much the tail is wagging the dog...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{three-dimensional}} full Navier–Stokes {{method is}} developed {{and applied to}} calculations of unsteady flows through multiple blade rows in axial-flow turbomachinery. The solver adopts the cell-centred finite volume discretization and the four-stage Runge–Kutta time-marching scheme. Unsteady calculations are effectively accelerated by using a time-consistent multi-grid technique, resulting in a speed-up {{by a factor of}} 10 – 20 with adequate temporal accuracy. The computational efficiency and validity of the present multi-grid technique are illustrated by comparisons with the results of the conventional dual time-stepping scheme. Calculated unsteady pressures on blade surfaces for a turbine stage test rig compare well with the corresponding experimental data. A computational study of turbine stage performances at different stator–rotor axial gaps reveals a <b>marked</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> behaviour of the interaction between incoming wakes and rotor passage-vortex structures. The time-averaged losses from unsteady calculations show a noticeable spanwise redistribution compared with the steady results.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the implementation and performances of a parallel solver for the {{direct numerical simulation}} of the three-dimensional and time-dependent Navier Stokes equations on distributed-memory, massively parallel computers. The feasibility of this approach to study Marangoni flow instability in half zone liquid bridges is examined. The {{results indicate that the}} incompressible, non linear Navier-Stokes problem, governing the Marangoni flows behaviour, can effectively be parallelized on a distributed-memory parallel machine by remapping the distributed data structure. The numerical code is based on a <b>three-dimensional</b> Simplified <b>Marker</b> and Cell primitive variable method applied to a staggered finite-difference grid. Using this method, the problem is split in two problems, one parabolic and the other elliptic. A parallel algorithm, explicit in time, is utilized to solve the parabolic equations. A parallel multisplitting kernel is introduced for the solution of the pseudo-pressure elliptic equation, representing the most time-consuming part of the algorithm. A grid-partition strategy is used in the parallel implementations of both the parabolic equations and the multisplitting elliptic kernel. A Message Passing Interface (MPI) is coded for the boundary conditions; this protocol is portable to different systems supporting this interface for interprocessor communications. Numerical experiments illustrate good numerical properties and parallel efficiency. In particular, good scalability on a large number of processors can be achieved as long as the granularity of the parallel application is not too small. However, increasing the number of processors, the Speed-Up is ever smaller than the ideal linear Speed Up. The communication timings indicate that complex practical calculations, such as the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for the numerical simulation of the instability of Marangoni flows, can be expected to run on a massively parallel machine with good efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{cryptography}} {{relies on}} algorithmic one-way functions - numerical functions which {{are easy to}} compute but very difficult to invert. This dissertation introduces physical one-way firnctions and physical one-way hash functions as primitives for physical analogs of cryptosystems. Physical one-way functions are defined {{with respect to a}} physical probe and physical system in some unknown state. A function is called a physical one-way function if (a) there exists a deterministic physical interaction between the probe and the system which produces an output in constant time (b) inverting the function using either computational or physical means is difficult (c) simulating the physical interaction is computationally demanding and (d) the physical system is easy to make but difficult to clone. Physical one-way hash functions produce fixed-length output regardless {{of the size of the}} input. These hash functions can be obtained by sampling the output of physical one-way functions. For the system described below, it is shown that there is a strong correspondence between the properties of physical one-way hash functions and their algorithmic counterparts. In particular, it is demonstrated that they are collision-resistant and that they exhibit the avalanche effect, i. e., a small change in the physical system causes a large change in the hash value. An inexpensive prototype authentication system based on physical one-way hash functions is designed, implemented, and analyzed. (cont.) The prototype uses a disordered three-dimensional microstructure as the underlying physical system and coherent radiation as the probe. It is shown that the output of the interaction between the physical system and the probe can be used to robustly derive a unique tamper-resistant identifier at a very low cost per bit. The explicit use of <b>three-dimensional</b> structures <b>marks</b> a departure from prior efforts. Two protocols, including a one-time pad protocol, that illustrate the utility of these hash functions are presented and potential attacks on the authentication system are considered. Finally, the concept offabrication complexity is introduced as a way of quantifying the difficulty of materially cloning physical systems with arbitrary internal states. Fabrication complexity is discussed in the context of an idealized machine - a Universal Turing Machine augmented with a fabrication head - which transforms algorithmically minimal descriptions of physical systems into the systems themselves. by Pappu Srinivasa Ravinkanth.

She had progressive decreased effort tolerance with increasing shortness of breath and increased frequency of wheezing episodes for which she had to seek treatment at the emergency depart-ment. She had no other medical conditions. She did not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. There was no occu-pational exposure to toxic substances. Family history was not significant.

40|$|A simple {{model of}} the thermohaline {{circulation}} (THC) is formulated, with the objective to represent explicitly the geostrophic force balance of the basinwide THC. The model comprises advective-diffusive density balances in two meridional-vertical planes located at the eastern and the western walls of a hemispheric sector basin. Boundary mixing constrains vertical motion to lateral boundary layers along these walls. Interior, along-boundary, and zonally integrated meridional flows are in thermal-wind balance. Rossby waves {{and the absence of}} interior mixing render isopycnals zonally flat except near the western boundary, constraining meridional flow to the western boundary layer. The model is forced by a prescribed meridional surface density profile. This two-plane model reproduces both steady-state density and steady-state THC structures of a primitive-equation model. The solution shows narrow deep sinking at the eastern high latitudes, distributed upwelling at both boundaries, and a western boundary current with poleward surface and equatorward deep flow. The overturning strength has a 2 / 3 -power-law dependence on vertical diffusivity and a 1 / 3 -power-law dependence on the imposed meridional surface density difference. Convective mixing plays an essential role in the two-plane model, ensuring that deep sinking is located at high latitudes. This role of convective mixing is consistent with that in <b>three-dimensional</b> models and <b>marks</b> a sharp contrast with previous two-dimensional models. Overall, the two-plane model reproduces crucial features of the THC as simulated in simple-geometry three-dimensional models. At the same time, the model self-consistently makes quantitative a conceptual picture of the three-dimensional THC that hitherto has been expressed either purely qualitatively or not self-consistently...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian {{dynamical}} {{systems are}} well formalized mathematically. They {{give rise to}} geometric structures describing motion of a point in smooth manifolds. Riemannian metric is a different geometric structure formalizing concepts of length and angle. The interplay of Riemannian metric and its metric connection with mechanical structures produces some features which are absent {{in the case of}} general (non-Riemannian) manifolds. The aim of present paper is to discuss these features and develop special language for describing Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian dynamical systems in Riemannian manifolds. 1. Force field of Newtonian dynamical system. The primary and most transparent way of describing real mechanical systems is based on Newton laws. Newton’s second law yields differential equation for the motion of small particle with mass m under the action of force F: m · ¨r = F(r, ˙r). (1. 1) Here r = r(t) is a vector of <b>three-dimensional</b> geometric space <b>marking</b> position of moving particle. Formally, one can consider the equation (1. 1) for r ∈ R n and can take m = 1 for the sake of simplicity. Further one can replace R n by arbitrary smooth manifold M and write the equation (1. 1) in local coordinates x 1, [...] ., x n: ¨x k = Φ k (x 1, [...] ., x n, ˙x 1, [...] ., ˙x n), k = 1, [...] ., n. (1. 2) Once the equations (1. 2) are written, we meet the problem if interpreting these equations. If x 1, [...] ., x n are coordinates of moving point p = p(t) in M, then their first derivatives ˙x 1, [...] ., ˙x n are components of velocity vector v ∈ Tp(M). But second derivatives ¨x 1, [...] ., ¨x n are not components of a tangent vector of Tp(M). Therefore we are to consider the pair q = (p,v) being a point of tangent bundle TM, and then write the equations (1. 2) as a system of first order ODE’s: ˙x k = v k, ˙v k = Φ k (x 1, [...] ., x n, v 1, [...] ., v n).
