5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the}} late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, in {{the hopes}} of saving the species, the then undescribed {{specimens}} of E. rabborum that teams of herpetologists collected were sent to captive breeding facilities in the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Centre (EVACC), Zoo Atlanta, and the Atlanta Botanical Garden. However, these efforts ultimately proved to be futile. The frogs <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> these facilities but never mated. The last female died in 2009 in the Atlanta Botanical Garden.|$|E
5|$|Low {{concentrations}} of pollen {{are found in}} sediments left by Lake Tauca in the Salar de Uyuni. Lake Minchin sediments contain more pollen (indicating {{that it may have}} had a more favourable climate), but the lack of pollen may be the product of a deeper lake.

Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> high temperatures. Psychrophiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> extremely low temperatures. – Temperatures as high as , as low as [...] Halophiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> an alkaline pH of about 8.5–11. Acidophiles can <b>thrive</b> <b>in</b> a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000-2,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space. A few extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans are radioresistant, resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.|$|R

5|$|Oklahoma {{also has}} a rich African American history. Many black towns <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century because of black {{settlers}} moving from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P.

David Beckham was runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass desertion of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> eastern Bosnia for the reminder of 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše regime and as many Chetniks and Partisans were unwilling to kill fellow Bosnian Serbs of the opposing faction.|$|E

He {{played in}} the violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great {{experience}} was to play Dvořák's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton. Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|As {{the town}} became more prominent, it was {{repeatedly}} {{attacked by the}} Hanseatic League. As the fishing industry <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding {{to the north of}} Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.|$|E

He <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> the new position, and was named a sophomore all-star by the Associated Press after the Rice Owls finished 1941 with a 6–3–1 win–loss–tie record. The following year, Humble earned All-Southwestern Conference honors and won the George Martin Award, given to Rice's most valuable player, as Rice put up a 7–2–1 record.|$|E

5|$|It is {{an ancient}} {{fortress}} with historical links to a village nearby traced to early Iron Age and later owned by the Thracians in the 5th century BC. Then, from 2nd to 4th centuries AD, it was controlled by the Romans who built towers and walls, and it was refurbished by the Byzantines as their garrison town. Shumen <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> the Middle Ages as an important stronghold of the Bulgarian Empire. In 1444 the fort was destroyed by the Ottomans after their victory in the Battle of Varna over a Christian army under Władysław III of Poland. The fortress remained deserted ever since.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild animal community once <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> the area of Level Mountain. This included {{a wide range of}} animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{hearings}} are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). HUAC {{is best known}} for the investigation of Alger Hiss and for its investigation of the Hollywood film industry, which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. HUAC was a House committee, and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938-1975).|$|E

5|$|Modern {{evidence}} indicates that even non-avian dinosaurs and birds <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> cooler temperate climates, and {{that at least some}} early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (aided by the animals' bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species). Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica as well as analysis of blood-vessel structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms. Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species such}} as tree {{squirrels}} and New World porcupines are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems.

Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea. Rodents have also <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War forever altered Indiana's economy. Despite hardships {{during the}} war, Indiana's {{economic}} situation improved. Farmers received {{higher prices for}} their agricultural products, railroads and commercial businesses <b>thrived</b> <b>in</b> the state's cities and towns, and manpower shortages gave laborers more bargaining power. The war also helped establish a national banking system to replace state-chartered banking institutions; by 1862 there were thirty-one national banks in the state.

In 1917, the British colonial government in Johor implemented an act which abolished the Kangchu system in the state, and the value for gambier declined during the early 20th century.|$|E
