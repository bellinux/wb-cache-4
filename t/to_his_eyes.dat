5|$|On 1 September 1863, {{twelve days}} after his sixteenth birthday, Prus {{took part in a}} battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four {{kilometers}} south of Siedlce. He suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong agoraphobia.|$|E
5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper closer and closer <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> When it was only {{an inch or so}} away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{specific}} work {{required by the}} make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go {{through a series of}} levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to make them bloodshot.|$|E

25|$|In 1801, Thomas Young made a pair {{of basic}} contact lenses based on Descartes' model. He used wax to affix water-filled lenses <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> which {{neutralized}} its refractive power. He then corrected for it with another pair of lenses.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, HLS {{managing}} {{director in the}} UK, Brian Cass, was beaten outside his home by three masked men — animal rights activist David Blenkinsop was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison for the attack — and HLS marketing director Andrew Gay was attacked on his doorstep with a chemical spray <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> that left him temporarily blinded.|$|E
25|$|Once {{he joined}} the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his {{trademark}} goggles (he briefly ditched them in the 1979–80 season). Years of battling under NBA backboards, and being hit and scratched in the face in the process, had taken their toll on his eyes and he developed corneal erosion syndrome, where the eyes begin to dry out easily and cease to produce moisture. He missed one game in the 1986–87 season due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> drying out and swelling as a result.|$|E

25|$|Horton's article {{includes}} an account by Shaker Aamer, a detainee and legal resident of Britain. His lawyer, Zachary Katznelson, had filed an affidavit {{in federal court}} in which Aamer said that he had been taken to the black site on 9 June 2006, where he was beaten and nearly asphyxiated. This was the same evening that the three prisoners died. Aamer said that during his interrogation, he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body. They also inflicted pain <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> bent his fingers until he screamed and then pressed against his throat and put a mask over him so he could not cry out. He said he could hardly breathe. Although Aamer was cleared for repatriation to Britain in 2009, as of 2015 he is still detained at Guantanamo, where he has been held for almost 15 years without charge or trial. He is the last British resident to be held there.|$|E
500|$|Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin, {{a cynical}} red dwarf. Dinklage was Adamson and Johnson's first choice, having {{seen him in}} The Station Agent. He {{accepted}} because [...] "often, you get the hero and the villain and not much in between. Trumpkin is in between. He is not a lovable Snow White dwarf. Audiences appreciate these cynical characters. It helps parents and adults {{to go along with}} the journey." [...] Dinklage's prosthetics took three hours to apply, and restricted his performance <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Even his frown was built into the make-up. On his first day of filming, he was bitten by sand flies and fell into a river. [...] "We were lucky that he returned after his first day!" [...] recalled Johnson.|$|E
500|$|During the trial's {{four weeks}} of testimony, the court heard {{evidence}} from Thomas S. Moulton, Hubbard's second-in-command aboard the USS PC-815. Moulton testified that Hubbard {{had told him that}} he had been involved in the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 and that he had been the only survivor of his destroyer, which had gone down with all hands save himself. The [...] "submarine battle" [...] of May 1943 was also described by Moulton and was hailed by a Church of Scientology attorney as [...] "a new untold chapter to the history of the Pacific conflict during World War II; and new perspectives on the magnitude – and proximity – of Japanese naval operations off the U.S. coast during the war." [...] Moulton also testified that Hubbard had told him that he had received combat injuries <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and back. In response, documents contradicting Moulton's (and Hubbard's) account were read into the record by Armstrong's attorney, Michael Flynn.|$|E

500|$|Animation on The Sorcerer's Apprentice {{began on}} January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the {{director}} of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem Der Zauberlehrling, and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as [...] "brilliantly colored thumbnails" [...] from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{for the first time to}} achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was used for reference when Mickey traverses through water.|$|E
500|$|The film {{contains}} more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements. Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years {{and make it a}} pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> his teeth, and his tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel film, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 31, 1911. The Billboard praised Marie Eline's acting also noting the good photography in its review. The Moving Picture Worlds review states, [...] "The part played by the grandmother and the one played by the child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch the heart. The person who can sit through this and not feel the tears welling up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> is strangely callous to human grief and emotion." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting, but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity. The reviewer wrote, [...] "It was noticed that the old lady's bag was brought on immediately, already packed, {{when she left the}} son's house and when she left the home. It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence of a number of this company's superior films. It would take time in life, and a split in the film would have done it. Such things spoil the illusion to a spectator." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was known}} for his high leg kick, the menacing glare through his cap pulled down almost <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and his {{deceptive}} changeup. When Hoffman first came into the league, he could throw up to 95mph. He would also throw a slider and only an occasional changeup. His original changeup was a conventional circle changeup taught to him by Cincinnati scout Larry Barton. Hoffman learned a different changeup, which he throws with a palmball grip, from teammate Donnie Elliott in 1994. [...] He began using the new changeup in 1995 when his fastball had dropped to 88–90mph after his offseason injury on the beach. [...] With the decrease in velocity, Hoffman knew he could not rely as much on his fastball. [...] He played through 1995 and had surgery the following offseason for a torn rotator cuff. When he returned the following year, Hoffman's fastball was at 87–88mph, but he had more experience with his new changeup. [...] His fastball reached back as high as 91mph in 1998, but by sometime after 2000 it dropped down to 83–88mph. His repertoire by then included primarily of his changeup, a four-seam fastball, a slower cut fastball that moves in towards a left-handed batter, and the occasional slider and a curveball.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{parents of}} the baby have {{miraculously}} escaped death in the crash of their carriage and trace the strange creature who rescued the child to his lair. They arrive as he ponders upon the picture in the locket and tries to recall the original of it. The babe {{is the daughter of}} the original and its mother the hermit's daughter, Agnes - the one-time tot whom the deserting wife took with her. A wife and mother, she is quite a mature woman now - but her features are unchanged. The face appears familiar to the hermit and he tries to place it. Eventually he succeeds. The shock of recognition dazes him - and changes him. The light of sanity returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> His reason is restored. He takes to his breast the daughter whom he had lost and found again. She takes him from his forest home and back to the civilization that had tricked him. But the kindly care and love his daughter bestows on him to act in a measure as a recompense for the wrong done him in the long ago, and with the passing years the bitterness passes from his being. The picture touches the heartstrings; it will please to a certainty." ...|$|E
500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{had previously}} used makeup to age DeForest Kelley {{in the season}} premiere [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] proved a unique challenge as four stages of make-up were required to show Admiral Jameson de-aging. The initial stage to show Jameson at his oldest, involved Rohner wearing a bald-cap and wig plus latex prosthetics applied <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> forehead, throat and jowls. That stage took up to four hours {{to apply to the}} actor. Westmore found himself worn out by the volume of work during this episode, as at the time the make-up team on the series included just him and Werner Keppler. On the second day of shooting the first stage make-up, Westmore arrived after Rohner had been in make-up for three hours only to find that he was only half finished. Keppler and Westmore rushed to get him so as not to delay the filming of the episode. Bowman later criticised the make-up used on Rohner, describing it as sub-par. Westmore said that [...] "if I was working on a film, and had several months to test Clayton's make-up beforehand, it probably would have turned out more to my liking. With less than a week to work with, I don't think it turned out too badly." ...|$|E

500|$|Russell {{refused to}} attend the {{ceremony}} when his #6 jersey was retired in 1972, or his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1975. While Russell still has sore feelings towards the city, there has {{been something of a}} reconciliation; and he has even visited the city regularly in recent years, something he never did in the years immediately after his retirement. When Russell originally retired, he demanded that his jersey be retired in an empty Boston Garden. In 1995, the Celtics left Boston Garden and entered the FleetCenter, now the TD Garden, and as the main festive act, the Boston organization wanted to re-retire Russell's jersey in front of a sellout audience. Perennially wary of what he long perceived as the racist city of Boston, Russell decided to make amends and gave his approval. On May 6, 1999, the Celtics re-retired Russell's jersey in a ceremony attended by his on-court rival (and friend) Chamberlain, along with Celtics legend Larry Bird and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The crowd gave Russell a prolonged standing ovation, which brought tears <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He thanked Chamberlain for taking him to the limit and [...] "making [...] a better player" [...] and the crowd for [...] "allowing [...] {{to be a part of}} their lives." [...] In December 2008, the We Are Boston Leadership Award was presented to Russell.|$|E
2500|$|The remark was spontaneous, and unprepared. As Brody put it, it just [...] "came {{out of my}} heart, at that instant."

2500|$|Pope Benedict was {{a slight}} man.

Benedict XV was dignified in bearing and courtly in terms of matters, but his appearance was not that of a pope. He had a sallow [...] complexion, a mat of black hair, and prominent teeth. Everything about him seemed crooked, from his nose <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and shoulders.|$|E
