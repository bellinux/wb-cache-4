5|$|The {{mortality}} rate {{for people who}} reach a hospital alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates place this number at 9%. The number of people reaching a hospital alive has increased, perhaps due to improved prehospital care or specialized treatment centers. Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first two hours of arrival. The sooner a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the {{mortality rate}}; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries <b>that</b> <b>prove</b> fatal.|$|E

25|$|In both, {{the male}} heroes make rash {{promises}} {{after having been}} stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, Arthur and Finrod; both show rings <b>that</b> <b>prove</b> their identities; both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, Twrch Trwyth and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf Carcharoth) {{with the help of}} a supernatural hound (Cafall and Huan). Both maidens possess such beauty that flowers grow beneath their feet when they come to meet the heroes for the first time, as if they were living embodiments of spring.|$|E
25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), {{the argument is}} not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments <b>that</b> <b>prove</b> the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.|$|E

However, this was only enough to provide Coleridge with a meagre living at Jesus College, which he would complain of often. This was compounded by the debt that Coleridge began to accrue and avoided paying. It is uncertain how Coleridge used his income, {{but it is possible}} that he ran into debt because of indulgence in wine and opium, the drug that he continued to use throughout college. It is also possible that he spent his money on prostitutes, which he deeply regretted and even had nightmares over. He was prone to sexual nightmares, and he recorded one such dream in 1803 about being pursued by a prostitute at both Christ's Hospital and Jesus College.|$|E

They first try to establish themselves in Crete, where Dardanus had once settled, but find it ravaged by the same plague that had driven Idomeneus away. They find the colony led by Helenus and Andromache, but decline to remain. After seven years they arrive in Carthage, where Aeneas has an affair with Queen Dido. (Since according to tradition Carthage was founded in 814 BC, the arrival of Trojan refugees a few hundred years earlier exposes chronological difficulties within the mythic tradition.) Eventually the gods order Aeneas to continue onward, and he and his people arrive {{at the mouth of the}} Tiber River in Italy. Dido commits suicide, and Aeneas's betrayal of her was regarded as an element in the long enmity between Rome and Carthage that expressed itself in the Punic Wars and led to Roman hegemony.|$|E

500|$|Weber {{defines the}} {{importance}} of societal class within religion by examining {{the difference between the}} two theodicies and to what class structures they apply. The concept of [...] "work ethic" [...] is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant [...] "work ethic", there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants. Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions <b>that</b> <b>prove</b> their right of possessing greater wealth.|$|E

[...] Evita premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on December 14, 1996, the Savoy Cinema in Dublin, Ireland, on December 19, 1996, and the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, London, on December 20, 1996.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, {{the study}} by Horner [...] tried {{to account for the}} fact that within a limited {{geological}} period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of anagenesis. This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true autapomorphies – unique traits <b>that</b> <b>prove</b> a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal (or ancestral) into more derived characters.|$|E

There Nikki and Loudon— who had become close with each other on their journey— express their love for each other, and Murray finds a partner. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki becomes broken-hearted, realizing that she has to go back to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married.

Nikki gate-crashes the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested and proclaims her love for Loudon. The film ends with Nikki and Loudon riding off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.|$|E
500|$|An early {{issue that}} {{attracted}} much attention, {{both positive and}} negative, was G.I. Joe #21, titled [...] "Silent Interlude", which was told entirely without words or sound effects.

[...] At first, the issue was controversial; some readers felt cheated that it had no words and could be [...] "read" [...] so quickly. However, it eventually became one of the series' most enduring and influential issues. Issue #21 has been recognized as a modern comic classic, and has become a prime example of comics' visual storytelling power.
