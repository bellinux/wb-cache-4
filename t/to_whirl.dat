25|$|The {{manner in}} which the bolas is swung differ between the three genera. Mastophora holds the bolas {{stationary}} with a front leg until a moth approaches, and then cocks the leg and swings the bolas towards the prey with a rapid pendulum-like stroke. Ordgarius begins <b>to</b> <b>whirl</b> the bolas rapidly when detecting an incoming moth. Cladomelea akermani whirls the bolas immediately after it is prepared for about 15 minutes, even when there is no moth present. Ordgarius sometimes has smaller droplets above the terminal one, whereas the other genera produce only one terminal globule.|$|E

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{susceptibility}} of a German wild rainbow trout strain (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to Myxobolus cerebralis, the causative agent of whirling disease in salmonids Whirling disease {{is an important}} parasitic disease of salmonids that attains increasing importance in Europe and in the USA. Previous {{studies have shown that}} a hatchery rainbow trout strain from Germany (DtHo) is relatively resistant <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> disease compared <b>to</b> three other German strains and one North American strain. The focus of this work was to investigate the susceptibility of the German wild rainbow trout strain DtWf to Myxobolus cerebralis and compare it with an American rainbow trout strain (AmTl), known to be very susceptible to the parasite. For the laboratory exposure, the trout strains were divided into 5 groups, each with 30 to 40 fish. These groups were infected with different doses of triactinomyxon-spores. The Susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> disease was gauged using the following two parameters, the incubation time and the percentage of fish exhibiting clinical signs of the disease over a five month period. Five months post exposure, 10 fish from each group were randomly taken for histological evaluation and counting of the spores. Each fish was processed separately. They were anesthetized; the weight and the length of each fish were documented. The present findings indicate that the German wild trout strain was less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> disease than the American AmTl strain. In the American strain, the disease had the shortest incubation time and lead to the most severe clinical symptoms. In the laboratory experiments, the American strain AmTl had the highest prevalence of infection. The spore count and the patho-histological assessments showed that the American strain was remarkably more susceptible to the disease than the German wild trout strain. Indeed, the American strain AmTl had 18 times more spores develop in their head than the German strain DtWf, at a dosage comparable to that present natural condition in North America. The investigation demonstrated that German strain of rainbow trout DtWf possess significantly greater resistance <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> disease than the American strain AmTl...|$|R

This investigation {{is concerned with}} planar <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> motion transition in the oscillation of an electrostatically actuated nanowire, which is pre-deflected due to applied DC voltage. We have derived dynamical equations of motion using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Galerkin formulation as reduced order model of the governing coupled partial differential equations. The dynamical equations have been solved using second-order averaging method and the averaging solution has been validated by comparing with the numerical solution of the reduced order model. Further, planar <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> motion transition has been investigated by studying qualitative changes in resonance curves with variation of electrostatic actuation. In this paper, we provide a simple analytical condition which {{takes into account the}} effects of DC voltage for prediction of initiation of whirling motion.

40|$|Abstract Background Whirling disease, {{caused by}} the {{pathogen}} Myxobolus cerebralis, afflicts several salmonid species. Rainbow trout are particularly susceptible and may suffer high mortality rates. The disease is persistent and spreading in hatcheries and natural waters of several countries, including the U. S. A., and the economic losses attributed <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> disease are substantial. In this study, genome-wide expression profiling using cDNA microarrays was conducted for resistant Hofer and susceptible Trout Lodge rainbow trout strains following pathogen exposure with the primary objective of identifying specific genes implicated in whirling disease resistance. Results Several genes were significantly up-regulated in skin following pathogen exposure for both the resistant and susceptible rainbow trout strains. For both strains, response to infection appears to be linked with the interferon system. Expression profiles for three genes identified with microarrays were confirmed with qRT-PCR. Ubiquitin-like protein 1 was up-regulated over 100 fold and interferon regulating factor 1 was up-regulated over 15 fold following pathogen exposure for both strains. Expression of metallothionein B, which has known roles in inflammation and immune response, was up-regulated over 5 fold in the resistant Hofer strain but was unchanged in the susceptible Trout Lodge strain following pathogen exposure. Conclusion The present study has provided an initial view into the genetic basis underlying immune response and resistance of rainbow trout <b>to</b> the <b>whirling</b> disease parasite. The identified genes have allowed us to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms implicated in salmonid immune response and resistance <b>to</b> <b>whirling</b> disease infection. </p...|$|R
50|$|Oil whirl can be {{prevented}} by a stabilising force applied to the journal. A number of bearing designs seek to use bearing geometry to either provide an obstacle <b>to</b> the <b>whirling</b> fluid or <b>to</b> provide a stabilising load <b>to</b> minimize <b>whirl.</b> One such is called the lemon bore or elliptical bore. In this design, shims are installed between {{the two halves of}} the bearing housing and then the bore is machined to size. After the shims are removed, the bore resembles a lemon shape, which decreases the clearance in one direction of the bore and increases the pre-load in that direction. The disadvantage of this design is its lower load carrying capacity, as compared to typical journal bearings. It is also still susceptible <b>to</b> oil <b>whirl</b> at high speeds, however its cost is relatively low.|$|R
