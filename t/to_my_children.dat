500|$|In August 1991, Gore {{announced}} that his son's accident {{was a factor}} in his decision not to run for president during the 1992 presidential election. Gore stated: [...] "I would like to be President. But I am also a father, and I feel deeply about my responsibility <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>children.</b> I didn't feel right about tearing myself away from my family to the extent that is necessary in a Presidential campaign." [...] During this time, Gore wrote Earth in the Balance, a text which became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make The New York Times Best Seller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>children?...</b> It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|After a few days, {{almost all}} the Dudley family were imprisoned in the Tower. All the men were {{eventually}} attainted and condemned to death. Warwick was tried on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall, alongside his father and the Marquess of Northampton. Warwick's turn was last and he, unlike the other defendants, pleaded guilty immediately. After sentence was passed Northumberland asked: [...] "that her Majesty may be gracious <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>children</b> ... considering they went by my commandment who am their father, and not of their own free wills". His execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning, however, it was suddenly cancelled; Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he publicly took the Catholic communion, forswearing his hitherto Protestant faith, in what was a great propaganda coup for the new, Catholic, government. Any hopes of a pardon were in vain for the Duke who, after short notice, was now to be beheaded the next day. An hour before his father's execution the Earl of Warwick was likewise led to St Peter ad Vincula to receive the sacrament; he then returned to his prison cell.|$|E
