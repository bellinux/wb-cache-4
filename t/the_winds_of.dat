5|$|As it is near several film studios {{including}} those at Pinewood, the airfield {{has been used}} to represent outside locations in a number of feature films. Scenes of the James Bond films Goldfinger, Thunderball and Octopussy were all filmed at Northolt, and station personnel served as extras in the Octopussy hangar fly-through stunt scene. The mini-series <b>The</b> <b>Winds</b> <b>of</b> War and The Bill and the BBC shows Waking the Dead, Doctor Who and Red Dwarf have all used Northolt to represent various fictional airfields. In early 2010 the station was used for action scenes in the final episode of the BBC's final series of Ashes to Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is a dwarf {{and member}} of House Lannister, {{one of the wealthiest}} and most {{powerful}} families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros. He subsequently appeared in Martin's A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000). Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in A Feast for Crows (2005) but returned in the next novel A Dance with Dragons (2011). The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume <b>The</b> <b>Winds</b> <b>of</b> Winter. The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels, in 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent GHRS {{observations}} of the Herbig Ae star AB Aur demonstrate the presence of N V in <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> this star. This result reveals temperatures much higher than those previously considered for <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> AB Aur. We show that homogeneous spherically symmetric models are unable to reproduce the available observations, including the C IV resonance lines in absorption {{and the absence of}} N IV emission. We then study models including hot (T≈ 140, 000 K) clumps, and argue that the N V lines can be formed in such hot regions. The filling factor of the hot clumps can be as small as a few 10 − 3. This type of clumpy structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is expected in the framework of a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> AB Aur, in which fast and slow streams alternate, and produce shocks where fast streams overtake slow ones. The presence <b>of</b> shocks in <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> <b>of</b> AB Aur would also be consistent with its X-ray emission...|$|R
5|$|Martin {{believes}} {{the last two}} volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called <b>The</b> <b>Winds</b> <b>of</b> Winter, taking {{the title of the}} last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.|$|E
5|$|October 24, 2005– Hurricane Wilma makes {{landfall}} near Cape Romano {{as a major}} hurricane, producing hurricane-force {{winds and}} moderate precipitation across much of southern portion of the state. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane leave 98% of South Florida without power. The passage of Wilma results in hundreds of damaged or destroyed homes, with damage reaching $20.6billion (2005USD, $25.8billion 2017USD), the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in United States history. Five people die in {{the state as a}} result of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{continued to}} intensify, although the NHC anticipated strengthening to cease, because the hurricane {{was expected to}} move into areas of colder sea surface temperatures. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the system increased and Fausto became a Category 4 hurricane. Becoming a Category4 hurricane, Fausto attained its peak intensity, with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 936mbar (hPa; 27.64inHg). After attaining peak intensity, the NHC again noted {{that it was very}} likely that Fausto attained its peak intensity, as it was nearing a region of sea surface temperatures less than 78°F (26°C).|$|E
40|$|Vortex, <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> a {{vector field}} in two dimensions, has its core the field {{singularity}} and its topological charge defined by <b>the</b> quantized <b>winding</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector field. Vortices {{are one of}} the most fundamental topological excitations in nature, widely known in hair whorls as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> hair strings, in fluid dynamics as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> velocities, in angular-momentum beams as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> phase angle and in superconductors and superfluids as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> order parameters. Nevertheless, vortices have hardly been observed other than those in the real space. Although band degeneracies, such as Dirac cones, can be viewed as momentum-space vortices in their mathematical structures, there lacks a well-defined physical observable whose winding number is an arbitrary signed integer. Here, we experimentally observed momentum-space vortices as <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> <b>of</b> far-field polarization vectors in the Brillouin zone (BZ) of periodic plasmonic structures. Using a home-made polarization-resolved momentum-space imaging spectroscopy, we completely map out the dispersion, lifetime and polarization of all radiative states at the visible wavelengths. The momentum space vortices were experimentally identified by their <b>winding</b> patterns in <b>the</b> polarization-resolved iso-frequency contours and their diverging radiative quality factors. Such polarization vortices can exist robustly on any periodic systems of vectorial fields, while they are not captured by the existing topological band theory developed for scaler fields. This work opens up a promising avenue for exploring topological photonics in the momentum space, studying bound states in continuum (BICs), as well as for rendering and steering vector beams and designing high-Q plasmonic resonances.

5|$|The wind-wind {{collision}} cone separates <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the two stars. For 55–75° {{behind the}} secondary, {{there is a}} thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that {{are unlikely to be}} produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000K and 41,000K.|$|E
5|$|The {{worst of}} the damage {{occurred}} {{on the island of}} Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm. Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E

5|$|A {{flock of}} birds {{encountered}} the hurricane over eastern Virginia; hundreds of birds were killed {{and fell to the}} ground near Old Point Comfort, many stripped of their feathers. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy amounts of precipitation near Washington, D.C., canceling a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and the Washington Senators after the field was flooded. In Ocean City, Maryland, the hurricane was considered the worst in 40years. The hurricane produced 80mph (130km/h) winds and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force winds affected the state. It was one of only two storms on record to produce such winds in the state. Three barges and a steamer capsized in the Delaware Bay, while onshore, <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane destroyed the roofs of four houses in Laurel. The winds downed many trees and destroyed several chimneys near Lewes. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, winds reached , which damaged telegraph and phone lines, knocked down several trees, and damaged the roof of Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station.|$|E
5|$|Early {{during the}} {{development}} of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (The New York Times reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least <b>The</b> <b>Winds</b> <b>of</b> Winter before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published {{before the start of the}} sixth season of the HBO series.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Fefa was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} slightly after reaching hurricane status to reach peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). However, it quickly intensified after a large, ragged eye developed early on August 1. On August 2, the eye organized further, and Fefa strengthened {{to attain a}} peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) while located about 940miles (1,510km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Based on higher Dvorak numbers, the hurricane could have peaked with winds stronger than 120mph (195km/h). Fefa encountered cooler waters shortly after peaking in intensity, and subsequently began to weaken. The hurricane gradually weakened as it turned more to the west, a change in motion due to building high pressures to its north, and on August 3 <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> Fefa dropped to 85mph (135km/h) due to cooler water and dry air.|$|E

5|$|Late on August 29, the cyclone {{leveled off}} in {{intensity}} as a mid-level Category4 hurricane {{due to an}} eyewall replacement cycle, where one eye gets replaced by another. The cycle continued for another 24 hours, only to start another burst of intensification. By the evening of August 31, Hurricane hunters measured winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a pressure of 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg) while the powerful cyclone began {{to turn to the}} north due to nearby Tropical Storm Kevin and a low pressure area west of Baja California. Wind shear increased as the hurricane moved over progressively cooler water. Despite weakening slightly, Jimena was anticipated by meteorologists to still remain a major hurricane as the storm moved ashore. This did not occur and Jimena steadily weakened. On September 1, Hurricane hunters found Jimena weaker, reporting winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). About 12 hours after the flight, <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> Jimena dropped below major hurricane intensity despite an increase of convection.|$|E
5|$|Pauline rapidly {{intensified}} {{after becoming}} a hurricane with favorable conditions for continued development, and 18hours after becoming a hurricane it attained a peak intensity of 135mph (215km/h). <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane weakened slightly to 115mph (185km/h), but on October 8 Pauline re-strengthened to reach winds of 135mph (215km/h) {{a short distance}} {{off the coast of}} Mexico. The hurricane turned more to the west-northwest while paralleling the southern coast of Oaxaca, and Pauline quickly weakened due to interaction with the mountainous terrain before landfall near Puerto Ángel as a 110mph (175km/h) hurricane early on October 9. The tropical cyclone continued to weaken as it paralleled the coast a short distance inland. On October 10, Pauline dissipated over the state of Jalisco.|$|E
