A special Reform Party meeting was planned for Nashville {{at which the}} Perot faction was expected to vacate the national chairmanship of Ventura-ally Jack Gargan. Both Trump and Ventura expressed disgust with the national party. [...] Ventura desired to disassociate the Minnesota Reform Party from the national party. [...] An unnamed official within the party told the AP that Ventura and Trump discussed a scenario where Ventura would run as the presidential nominee of the disaffiliated party with Trump as his running mate. [...] The chairman of the Minnesota Reform Party denied Ventura {{would be part of}} any presidential ticket. After privately notifying Trump of his intentions and seeking his blessing, Ventura held a press conference on February 12 and officially left the national Reform Party, remaining a member of his state party, which he urged to disaffiliate and return to its original name, the Independence Party of Minnesota. [...] He voiced dissatisfaction with the presidential contest, explaining <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> was running [...] "virtually unopposed" [...] and receiving support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke; something with which Ventura could not associate. [...] Ventura invited Trump to run for the presidential nomination of the Independence Party, which Ventura believed could become a national entity. [...] At the party's next meeting, it disaffiliated. [...] Trump considered Ventura's invitation but had concerns, particularly the question of whether other state parties would affiliate with the new party. [...] Minnesota political scientist Steve Schier doubted the party could become a national entity, arguing that it was far too small to make an impact on the national level. [...] Ventura's move came just ahead of the Nashville meeting where, with the rationale of failing to [...] "faithfully perform and execute the duties of his office," [...] Gargan was removed by a 109 to 31 committee vote. The chaotic meeting, dominated by Perot-faction members, featured shoving matches and physical squabbles as the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department intervened to restore order. [...] Gargan charged that the meeting was illegal due to insufficient notice, though a quorum was present.|$|E

40|$|Regardless of his {{finish in}} the primaries, Mr. Buchanan is {{determined}} to be heard from at the Republican National Convention in late summer. Mr. [Bob Dole] would like his endorsement for the votes it would provide, but cannot be serious about hoping 2 ̆ 2 <b>that</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> would find it in his heart as a good Republican to join forces and close ranks. 2 ̆ 2 Can good Republicans be outright bigots? Does Mr. Dole have a political death wish? What 2 ̆ 7 s in Mr. Buchanan 2 ̆ 7 s heart is the cause. 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ll go forward, 2 ̆ 2 he vowed on national television, 2 ̆ 2 fighting for the cause. 2 ̆ 2 But {{the purity of the}} cause is forever tainted by the essential Buchanan: a mean-spirited racist, an articulate hatemonger, a political pundit who relishes his reputation for pulling few punches when attacking blacks, liberals, Jews and Israel. A master of ad hominem attack invites the same in return. Bob Dole must challenge [Patrick J. Buchanan], and ultimately hold him accountable, for all that he has said and written. It won 2 ̆ 7 t be easy. Mr. Dole must not allow himself to be out-Scriptured by Mr. Buchanan, who professes to be motivated by the Bible...|$|E
