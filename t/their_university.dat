5|$|Gan also {{founded a}} school for the poor {{in the village of}} Sam-toh in Fujian, China, where his forefathers were born, and helped to finance and {{maintain}} the Tranquerah Chinese Free School in Melaka. He also enabled young men of promise to realise their potential by paying for <b>their</b> <b>university</b> education. An example was the case of Wee Theam Tew, who gave up a clerical post with Macalister & Co. and proceeded to England to further his studies in law and qualify for the Bar in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Tolman and Conant, {{in their}} role as the project's {{scientific}} advisers, drew {{up a list of}} candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of <b>their</b> <b>university</b> or company asking for them to be released for essential war work. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} business students’ individual values and {{their perception of}} <b>their</b> <b>university’s</b> values {{and the relationship between}} these values and affective organisational commitment. Findings indicate that both groups of business students rated their personal values as consistent with the rankings of the major pan—cultural values with strong ethical orientation and self—development and learning values. In both educational institutions organisational vision values and individual conservatism values predicted affective commitment. Findings also indicate statistically significant differences between the students’ personal values and their perception of <b>their</b> <b>university’s</b> values, suggesting a degree of lack of P—O fit between the students’ values and <b>their</b> <b>university’s</b> values...|$|R

5|$|When Muñoz Rivera {{was twelve}} years old, his mother fell ill and died. By this time, the family had grown to include nine more siblings, whom he taught. By the age of fourteen, Muñoz Rivera was {{managing}} legal documents, working with the local church clergy, and helping in his father's store. There were no {{institutions of higher learning}} on the island at that time, and most families sent their children to Cuba (University of la Habana, founded in 1728), Spain or North America to complete <b>their</b> <b>university</b> education. Muñoz Rivera wanted to travel to Spain and study law, but his father wanted him {{to take care of the}} family's business.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the spread}} of such ideas was {{forbidden}} in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of LouisXVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News {{of the events of}} 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many enlightened criollos came into contact with liberal authors and their works during <b>their</b> <b>university</b> studies, either in Europe or at the University of Chuquisaca (modern Sucre). Books from the United States found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, owing to the proximity of Venezuela to the United States and the West Indies.|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} emeritus professors at an English {{university}} aims to stimulate debate about their professional and leisure activities in retirement, how much use they make of <b>their</b> <b>university’s</b> facilities {{and how much}} use <b>their</b> <b>universities</b> make of them. It reveals that about half remain very happily active in teaching and research, though not always remunerated for it or recognised by <b>their</b> <b>universities</b> for <b>their</b> contributions. Unlike their North American counterparts, hardly any have celebratory rites of passage to emeritus status, or emeritus associations or centres that they can join. There was some disquiet amongst emeriti about their status and no university policy about using emeriti’s contributions, but generally England’s emeriti are healthily active, enjoying {{a wide range of}} activities and some contacts with their previous careers...|$|R

25|$|The {{students}} have different teachers for different subjects, {{and it is}} normal that these teachers stay with a class for an entire course. A teacher usually holds a combined master's degree in two different subjects which are the only subjects which that teacher is qualified to teach. In addition to <b>their</b> <b>university</b> studies, newly employed teachers take a pædagogicum which since August 2009 is a one-year part-time course in pedagogy, having previously been a two-year course.|$|E
50|$|Content is not {{generally}} output across traditional media, as a broadcast licence may be prohibitively expensive to small non-profit organisations. Most student television stations use the Internet {{as a primary}} method of distributing content; either on a dedicated website, via <b>their</b> <b>university's</b> pages or on video sharing sites such as YouTube.

25|$|This system {{dates from}} the Middle Ages, when {{the study of the}} liberal arts took seven years. In the late Middle Ages most {{students}} joined <b>their</b> <b>university</b> at an earlier age than is now usual, often when aged only 14 or 15. The basic university education in the liberal arts comprised the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric and dialectic) and the Quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and music), and typically took seven years of full-time study.|$|E

In 1971, he put together the Electronic Warfare Study Group, a team of newly graduated engineers who had excelled in <b>their</b> <b>university</b> studies which was headed by Dr. Tay Eng Soon, then a university lecturer. The group worked on Project Magpie, a secret project to develop Singapore's defence technology capabilities.|$|E

The intention {{is to give the}} prisoners the tools to deal with life outside, so that upon release from prison they will have the appropriate education to help them obtain jobs, and prevent them from returning to a life of crime.|$|E

After getting a statement of successful completion of each month from their supervisors, new doctors take the esame di stato ("state exame") to obtain full license to practise medicine. They will then have to register with one of the branches of the Ordine dei Medici ("Order of Physicians"), which are based in each of the Provinces of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Conservatives, Eves {{announced}} that he would resign as leader in 2004. Flaherty declared himself a candidate to succeed him, but was defeated by John Tory by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent on the second ballot of the PC leadership election held on September 18, 2004. His supporters included former cabinet ministers John Baird, Tim Hudak and Norm Sterling. His 2004 leadership campaign was similar to that of 2002. He emphasized fiscally conservative themes, including further tax cuts and greater privatization. He promised to create EXCEL scholarships, whereby students attaining high grades in high school would have half <b>their</b> <b>university</b> tuition paid by the government. Until 2005, Flaherty served as finance critic in John Tory's shadow cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to {{go out of their way}} to protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees were more likely to report having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with <b>their</b> <b>university</b> were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E
