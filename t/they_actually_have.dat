5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, tells people that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E
25|$|Counterfeit USB flash drives are {{sometimes}} sold with claims of having higher capacities than <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have.</b> These are typically low capacity USB drives which are modified {{so that they}} emulate larger capacity drives (for example, a 2GB drive being marketed as a 64GB drive). When plugged into a computer, they report themselves as being the larger capacity they were sold as, but when data is written to them, either the write fails, the drive freezes up, or it overwrites existing data. Software tools exist to check and detect fake USB drives, {{and in some cases}} it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real storage limit.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} species of fungus that grow alongside the domatia where the ants live. In fact, when the founding queen first starts laying eggs in the domatia of a new H. physophora, the hyphae of multiple different species of fungi will entirely cover {{the entrance to the}} domatia. When the worker ants mature, <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> to dig their way through the fungal covering to get to the outside of the plant. However, almost even more remarkably, out of all of these fungal species, A. decemarticulatus will only cultivate one specific species. This fungus is a sooty mold which, according to one study by Mario X. Ruiz-Gonzalez et al. (2010), is characterized by closely related haplotypes (genetic markers) in the order Chaetothyriales. The ants use this mold to construct their traps.|$|E

500|$|In a February 4, 2008 {{appearance}} on the G4 television program Attack of the Show!, Mark Ebner, journalist {{and author of the}} book Hollywood, Interrupted, and Nick Douglas of Gawker.com commented on Project Chanology. Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E

[...] "Spider web" [...] is typically {{used to refer to}} a web that is apparently still in use (i.e. clean), whereas [...] "cobweb" [...] refers to abandoned (i.e. dusty) webs. However, [...] "cobweb" [...] is used to describe the tangled three-dimensional web of some spiders of the Theridiidae family. While this large family is also known as the tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders and comb-footed spiders, <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a huge range of web architectures.|$|E

2500|$|Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) are {{important}} ancillary tests in CRPS {{because they are}} among the most reliable methods of detecting nerve injury. They can be used as one of the primary methods to distinguish between CRPS I & II, which differ based on whether there is evidence of actual nerve damage. EMG & NCS are also among the best tests for ruling in or out alternative diagnoses. CRPS is a [...] "diagnosis of exclusion", which requires that there be no other diagnosis that can explain the patient's symptoms. This is very important to emphasise because otherwise patients can be given a wrong diagnosis of CRPS when <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a treatable condition that better accounts for their symptoms. An example is severe Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which can often present in a very similar way to CRPS. Unlike CRPS, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can often be corrected with surgery in order to alleviate the pain and avoid permanent nerve damage and malformation.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Wang Wei's {{most famous}} poetry was {{done as a}} series of couplets written by him to which his friend Pei Di wrote {{replying}} couplets. Together, these form a group titled the Wang River Collection. Note that [...] "Wang" [...] as in the river is a different character that the [...] "Wang" [...] of Wang Wei's name. It literally refers to the outside part of a wheel; and also that these are sometimes referred to as the [...] "Lantian poems", after the real name of Wang's estate's location, in what is now Lantian County. Inspired in part by Wang's Lantian home and features of its neighborhood and by their correspondences with other places and features, the collection includes such pieces as the poem often translated [...] "Deer Park" [...] (literally, [...] "Deer Fence"). However, the poems tend to have a deceptive simplicity to them, while <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> great depth and complexity upon closer examination.|$|E
2500|$|Testing {{is often}} edited due to time {{constraints}} of a televised episode. It can often {{seem as if}} the teams draw results from fewer repetitions and a smaller data set than <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have.</b> During the Outtakes Special, they specifically stated that while they are, in fact, very thorough in testing myths and repeat experiments many times in many different configurations, it is simply impossible to display all of it during a program. Beginning in the fifth season, episodes typically contain a prompt for the viewer to visit the show's homepage to view outtake footage of either additional testing, or other facets of the myths being tested. However, Savage himself has acknowledged {{that they do not}} purport always to achieve a satisfactorily large enough set of results to overcome definitively all bias. In response to criticisms they receive about their methods and results in previous episodes, the staff produced several [...] "Myths Revisited" [...] episodes, in which the teams retest myths to see if the complaints have merit. These episodes have sometimes resulted in overturning results of several myths, as well as upholding some results for different reasons than originally concluded.|$|E
50|$|Morrison turned mutants into a subculture, {{a logical}} {{extension}} {{of what happens}} when new elements are introduced into society. They were still oppressed, but <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>had</b> some kind of culture to go along with their oppression.

5000|$|Football {{coaches at}} the University of Delaware named a {{football}} play after Sally Rand.

60|$|But let us {{look over}} the months of our calendar. In which of them do we not need fires on our hearths? We will venture to say that from October to June all families, whether <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> it or not, would be the more {{comfortable}} for a morning and evening fire. For eight months in the year the weather varies {{on the scale of}} cool, cold, colder, and freezing; and for all the four other months what is the number of days that really require the torrid-zone system of shutting up houses? We all know that extreme heat is the exception, and not the rule.|$|E
60|$|For {{our next}} example {{let us take}} the great islands of Sumatra and Java. These {{approach}} so closely together, and the chain of volcanoes that runs through them gives such an air of unity to the two, {{that the idea of}} their having been recently dissevered is immediately suggested. The natives of Java, however, go further than this; for <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> a tradition of the catastrophe which broke them asunder, and fix its date at {{not much more than a}} thousand years ago. It becomes interesting, therefore, to see what support is given to this view by the comparison of their animal productions.|$|E

Halting {{on the banks of the}} Portneuf, he dispatched scouts a few miles above, to visit the old camping ground and search for signals of the party, or of their whereabouts, should <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> abandoned the spot.

The upper classes, broadly speaking, are originally composed of the best-bred (in the mere animal sense of the term), the most energetic, and most thoughtful, of the population, who either by strength of arm seize the land from the rest, and make slaves of them, or bring desert land into cultivation, over which they have therefore, within certain limits, true personal right; or, by industry, accumulate other property, or by choice devote themselves to intellectual pursuits, and, though poor, obtain an acknowledged superiority of position, shown by benefits conferred in discovery, or in teaching, or in gifts of art. This is all in the simple course {{of the law of}} nature; and the proper offices of the upper classes, thus distinguished from the rest, become, therefore, in the main threefold:-- ...|$|E
