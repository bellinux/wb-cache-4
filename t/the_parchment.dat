5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. <b>The</b> <b>parchment</b> worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
5|$|The folios {{are made}} of vellum {{parchment}} primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. (Tischendorf himself thought that <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise.) Most of the quires or signatures contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. As {{for the cost of}} the material, time of scribes and binding, it equals the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} of {{treatment}} stabilized the ink of the text using a gelatin adhesive. The dirt and grime were then cleaned from <b>the</b> <b>parchments,</b> though original intentional marks were left alone. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were then humidified and dried under tension to flatten <b>the</b> <b>parchments.</b> <b>The</b> Declaration of Independence, which has been damaged by frequent handling and exposure, was not humidified because of its increased moisture sensitivity. All <b>the</b> <b>parchments</b> were then installed into new titanium and aluminum encasements, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which are filled with inert argon gas. The current environmental conditions of the Charters of Freedom encasements is monitored by scientists and conservators for signs of possible deterioration agents.|$|R

The beans are bagged and labeled according to their quality, and stored in the compound's warehouse to await sale.|$|E
5|$|The text {{is written}} in gold in Carolingian {{minuscule}} calligraphy, and the gold ink was obtained from an alloy of silver and gold leaf. A few lines or words stand out as they are written in rustic capitals. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> has slightly warped, {{and there is a}} fold {{in the middle of the}} document.

5|$|The fourth copy, {{owned by}} Salisbury Cathedral, was first given in 1215 to its predecessor, Old Sarum Cathedral. Rediscovered by the cathedral in 1812, it has {{remained}} in Salisbury throughout its history, except when being taken off-site for restoration work. It is possibly the best preserved of the four, although small pin holes {{can be seen in}} <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> from where it was once pinned up. The handwriting on this version is {{different from that of the}} other three, suggesting that it was not written by a royal scribe but rather by a member of the cathedral staff, who then had it exemplified by the royal court.|$|E

5|$|The two 1215 {{charters}} {{held by the}} British Library, {{known as}} Cotton MS. Augustus II.106 and Cotton Charter XIII.31a, were acquired by the antiquarian Sir Robert Cotton in the 17th century. One of these was originally found by Humphrey Wyems, a London lawyer, who may have discovered it in a tailor's shop. The other was found in Dover Castle in 1630 by Sir Edward Dering. The Dering charter is usually identified as the copy originally sent to the Cinque Ports in 1215. (In 2015 {{it was announced that}} David Carpenter had found Dering's copy to be identical to a 1290s transcription made from Canterbury Cathedral's 1215 copy and so he suggests that the Dering copy's destination was the Cathedral rather than the Cinque Ports.) This copy was damaged in the Cotton library fire of 1731, when its seal was badly melted. <b>The</b> <b>parchment</b> was somewhat shrivelled but otherwise relatively unscathed, and an engraved facsimile of the charter was made by John Pine in 1733. In the 1830s, however, an ill-judged and bungled attempt at cleaning and conservation rendered the manuscript largely illegible to the naked eye. This is, nonetheless, the only surviving 1215 copy still to have its great seal attached.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>parchment</b> of the Birmingham Quran {{manuscript}} received radiocarbon {{analysis in}} 2015, which revealed with a 95.4% accuracy {{that it was}} made from an animal alive sometime between 568 and 645 AD, roughly around the lifetime of Muhammad. The text differs only slightly to modern versions of the Quran. Only <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> has been analysed, {{the date of the}} ink is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating, {{begun in}} 1995 by {{physicist}} Douglass Donahue and chemists Jacqueline Olin and Garman Harbottle, places {{the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> somewhere between 1423 and 1445. The initial results were confusing because the unknown substance the British Museum had found across the whole map, effectively ignored by later researchers who were concentrating on the ink, {{turned out to be}} trapping tiny traces of fallout deep within <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> from 1950s nuclear tests. Although there is none of this 1950s substance on top of the ink, further tests, starting with a detailed chemical analysis, are needed to confirm whether the lines were drawn after it soaked into <b>the</b> <b>parchment.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{coexistence}} of time in Gabriel Garcfa Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude as a cause of the supernatural events, the hereditary memory, and the solitude and {{to examine the effects of}} this mythical time frame on character development, plot, narrative structure, and theme. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter introduces <b>the</b> <b>parchments</b> as creators of mythical time. The second, third, and fourth chapters investigate the effects of this unconventional time. Supernatural events, clairvoyance, and solitude are all examined as effects. The final chapter correlates the writing of <b>the</b> <b>parchments</b> with <b>the</b> writing of the novel and explains the effects of unconventional time on the reader. Thus, this thesis illustrates how the coexistence of time functions of two levels: the level of <b>the</b> <b>parchments</b> and <b>the</b> level of the novel...|$|R

25|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques {{that are used}} on papyrus {{can be applied to}} parchment as well. They do not date the age of the writing but the preparation of <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> itself. While it is feasibly possible also to radio carbon date certain kinds of ink, it is extremely difficult to do {{due to the fact that}} they are generally present on the text only in trace amounts, and it is hard to get a carbon sample of them without the carbon in <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> contaminating it.|$|E
25|$|At first, little {{interest}} {{was shown in}} <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–1809) but having left Washington, he had lost track {{of it in the}} years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> folded in a small tin box {{on the floor of a}} closet at the State, War and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two glass plates and kept them in a safe.|$|E
25|$|To make <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> more aesthetically {{pleasing}} or {{more suitable}} for the scribes, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing pumice powder into the flesh side of parchment {{while it was still}} wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> smooth and white, thin pastes (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.|$|E

Minstrels will turn it into songs which thy own Saxon serfs shall sing behind their plough-stilts, and men-at-arms riding through thy Norman towns.

50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>parchment</b> {{documents}} were {{turned over to}} the Library of Congress by executive order, and in 1924, President Coolidge dedicated the bronze-and-marble shrine for public display of the Constitution at the library's headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>parchments</b> were laid over moisture-absorbing cellulose paper, vacuum-sealed between double panes of insulated plate glass, and protected from light by a gelatin film. Although building construction of the Archives Building was completed in 1935, in December 1941 they were moved from the Library of Congress and stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository, Fort Knox, Kentucky, until September 1944. In 1951, following a study by the National Bureau of Standards to protect from atmosphere, insects, mold and light, <b>the</b> <b>parchments</b> were re-encased with special light filters, inert helium gas and proper humidity.

25|$|In addition, tests by the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Sicily, Italy, have {{suggested}} that the origin of parchment of select Dead Sea Scroll fragments is from the Qumran area itself, by using X-ray and Particle Induced X-ray emission testing of the water used to make <b>the</b> <b>parchment</b> that were compared with the water from the area around the Qumran site.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>parchment</b> sheet Nomina defunctorum ("Names of the Dead"), most {{probably}} {{written in the}} second half of 1161, mentions the nobleman Rudolf of Tarcento, a lawyer of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, who had bestowed a canon with 20 farmsteads beside the castle of Ljubljana (castrum Leibach) to the Patriarchate. According to the historian Peter Štih's deduction, this happened between 1112 and 1125, thus representing the earliest mention of Ljubljana.|$|E
25|$|Other {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} grease-resistant paper, such as waxing the paper or using fluorine-based chemicals. Highly beating the fibers gives an even more translucent paper with the same grease resistance. Silicone and other coatings may also be applied to <b>the</b> <b>parchment.</b> A silicone-coating treatment produces a cross-linked material with high density, stability and heat resistance and low surface tension which imparts good anti-stick or release properties. Chromium salts {{can also be used to}} impart moderate anti-stick properties.|$|E
