5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use plumage {{to assess}} and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E
5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Some caterpillars, {{especially}} {{members of}} Papilionidae, contain an osmeterium, a Y-shaped protrusible gland {{found in the}} prothoracic segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> the predators.|$|E

5|$|A meter {{in length}} canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, {{are used to}} make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black patina over the {{engraved}} parts; the engraving designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Cubeb {{was thought}} {{by the people}} of Europe to be repulsive to demons, just as it was {{by the people of}} China. Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of {{exorcism}} in the late 17th century, includes cubeb as an ingredient in an incense <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> incubus. Even today, his formula for the incense is quoted by neopagan authors, some of whom also claim that cubeb can be used in love sachets and spells.|$|E

During the rare event, a ring of grass measuring two metres in height is erected within the temple's hall. After receiving a blessing from the priest, the worshipper steps through the ring while praying for good health and long life.|$|R

5|$|Female vampire-like monsters are the Soucouyant of Trinidad, and the Tunda and Patasola of Colombian folklore, {{while the}} Mapuche of {{southern}} Chile have the bloodsucking snake {{known as the}} Peuchen. Aloe vera hung backwards behind or near a door was thought <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> vampiric beings in South American superstition. Aztec mythology described tales of the Cihuateteo, skeletal-faced spirits {{of those who died}} in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.|$|E
5|$|Inari's kitsune are white, a {{color of}} good omen. They possess the power <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> evil, and they {{sometimes}} serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene {{on behalf of}} the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, coumarin, rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E

5|$|Solar and lunar eclipses were {{considered}} to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> disaster.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil {{is made from}} their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|The game's puzzles {{are divided}} into groups set on {{different}} planets. Players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress to the next one, but the game includes optional harder puzzles. Final boss levels, called out as defense levels, complete each planet; here, the player must efficiently create chemicals and deliver them in a timely manner, once the reactor systems have been started, to trigger defense systems <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the alpine}} winter {{manifestations of the}} agrarian year, some ancient rituals are held to secure {{prosperity}} and good harvest. Masked parades are striking examples of these activities. Masks are {{an essential part of}} the carnival costume. They are used with the purpose of waking, activating, stimulating and increasing the creative forces of life and conversely <b>to</b> <b>warding</b> <b>off</b> evil spirits. The mask is the symbol of all metamorphoses: in this sense, the rites of Carnival and the Commedia dell’Arte reveal similar action and similar characters, cast in very similar original patterns...|$|R

He was our professor’s father and unofficial course aid, but he became so much more as the summer grew on. Behind his rugged and somewhat aged exterior is a man of youthful curiosity and extraordinary experience.

50|$|Keeping {{peace on}} the borders was a {{constant}} preoccupation of Byzantine emperors, who often bought off Barbarian threats in addition <b>to</b> <b>warding</b> <b>off</b> actual attacks. Zeno was no exception, and often tried to play off different tribes against each other. In matters of religion Byzantine Emperors had to steer between competing versions of Christianity and in 482 Zeno attempted a compromise with his Henotikon. Zeno had no heirs at his death and although the Leonid dynasty technically ended with Leo II, Zeno was allied to them through marriage.|$|R
5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors have been used <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires {{do not have a}} reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{regarded as}} foreign elements in Roman culture, {{music and dance}} had existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the tibia (Greek aulos), a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> ill influences. Song (carmen) {{was an integral part}} of almost every social occasion. The Secular Ode of Horace, commissioned by Augustus, was performed publicly in 17 BC by a mixed children's choir. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos, and was associated particularly with mathematics and knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Apotropaics—items able <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> revenants—are {{common in}} vampire folklore. Garlic {{is a common}} example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E

5|$|City at the End of Time is a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom.

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{during which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} as new fortifications like Fort Chambers, near Anahuac, were constructed <b>to</b> <b>ward</b> <b>off</b> a mainland invasion by Union forces and to protect supply routes to and from Galveston.

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{in which}} Texas seceded from the United States, the area served a limited {{role in the}} {{conflict}} though no major battles were fought on the mainland shoreline.
