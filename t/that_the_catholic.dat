5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. He argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism came to the fore.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of an artillery blockhouse at East Tilbury in 1539–40 as part of a major scheme to fortify the coastline of England and Wales. It followed his break from the Pope and the Catholic Church, which led to fears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> powers of Europe would seek to invade so as to reimpose Papal authority. Five blockhouses were built along the Thames between Gravesend and Higham – two on the north bank at Tilbury and East Tilbury and three on the south bank at Gravesend, Milton (near the present New Tavern Fort) and Higham.|$|E

During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Asháninka, because of the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted {{to the use of}} violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E

5|$|Keeler {{was known}} for his {{commitment}} to ecumenism. When Pope John Paul II visited the United States in 1987, Keeler helped arrange his meetings with Jewish leaders in Miami, Florida and Protestant leaders in Columbia, South Carolina. The meeting with the Jews took place after they threatened to boycott the meeting after the Pope met with former U.N. General Secretary Kurt Waldheim, whom, as it had recently been revealed, had previous connections to Nazi Germany. After Keeler intervened, the Jewish leaders agreed to attend the meeting. On November 18, 2005, at the annual general assembly of the National Council of Churches, he reassured delegates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church, and Pope Benedict XVI, were firmly ecumenical.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{identify}} themselves as adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, Cao Đài or Roman Catholicism. Vietnamese Buddhists are mainly found among impoverished communities living in the Tonle Sap or the rural parts of Cambodia. As Vietnamese Buddhists derive their religious doctrines and beliefs from Chinese folk religion, they participate in religious rituals organised by Chinese Cambodians during festive seasons. Vietnamese communities that have settled down in Cambodia have adopted Khmer Theravada Buddhist practices to some extent. Vietnamese adherents of Roman Catholicism consist of descendants of refugees that fled the religious persecution {{during the reign of}} Tự Đức. They are split between city dwellers based in Phnom Penh and fishing communities that are based in Tonle Sap. Vietnamese Catholics make up about 90% of Cambodia's Roman Catholic community, and in the 1960s they had about 65,000 adherents in the country. Most of the Vietnamese Catholics were either deported to Vietnam or killed in March 1970, and it was only in 1990 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> church was allowed to re-establish itself in Cambodia. In 2005, there were about 25,000 Catholics in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
50|$|Henry Spalding {{and other}} anti-Catholic ministers later claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Whitman killings were instigated by Catholic priests. According to their accounts, <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> may have told <b>the</b> Cayuse <b>that</b> Whitman had caused disease among their people and incited them to attack. Spalding and other Protestant ministers {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> {{wanted to take}} over the Protestant mission, which Whitman had refused to sell to them. They accused Fr. Pierre-Jean De Smet of being a party to such provocations.|$|R

60|$|Francois de Laville had, {{with his}} own troop, ridden off to his chateau from Parthenay {{on the morning after}} the battle; Coligny advising him to take his mother, at once, to La Rochelle, as the chateau would speedily be attacked, in revenge for <b>the</b> sharp repulse <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> had {{suffered}} there. On his arrival the countess at once summoned all the tenants, and invited those who chose to accompany her; pointing out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholics</b> would speedily ravage the land. Accordingly, the next day all the valuables in the chateau were packed up in carts, and the place entirely abandoned. The whole of the tenants accompanied her, driving their herds before them, as they would find a market for these in the city. As they moved along they were joined by large numbers of other fugitives, as throughout the whole country the Protestants were making for refuge to the city.|$|R
5|$|Soon after, {{the chaos}} of the English Civil War gave Claiborne another {{opportunity}} to reclaim Kent Island. The Calverts, who had received such constant support from the King, in turn supported the monarchy during {{the early stages of the}} parliamentary crisis. Claiborne found a new ally in Richard Ingle, a pro-Parliament Puritan merchant whose ships had been seized by the Catholic authorities in Maryland in response to a royal decree against Parliament. Claiborne and Ingle saw an opportunity for revenge using the Parliamentary dispute as political cover, and in 1644 Claiborne seized Kent Island while Ingle took over St. Mary's. Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> Calverts could not be trusted. By 1646, however, Governor Leonard Calvert had retaken both St. Mary's and Kent Island with support from Governor Berkeley of Virginia, and, after Leonard Calvert died in 1648, Cecil Calvert appointed a pro-Parliament Protestant to take over as governor. The rebellion and its religious overtones was one of the factors that led to passage of the landmark Maryland Toleration Act of 1649, which declared religious tolerance for Catholics and Protestants in Maryland.|$|E
