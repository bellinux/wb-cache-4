500|$|Speed Racer premiered on April 26, 2008 {{during a}} $500,000-estimated {{event at the}} Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, where 4,000 people attended. It was {{released}} in regular theaters on May 9, 2008, grossing $18,561,337 in its opening weekend from around 6,700 screens at 3,606 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking third {{at the box office}} behind Iron Man and What Happens in Vegas. In its second weekend it grossed $8,117,459 and ranked fourth at the box office. The film closed its run on August 1, 2008 with $43,945,766 domestically and $93,945,766 worldwide. Based on its total gross, it was considered a box office bomb. The results were well below studio expectations, given that the production costs of Speed Racer were estimated to be over $120 million. Despite the low box office numbers, Warner Bros. remained optimistic about sales of associated products ranging from toys to tennis shoes. Brad Globe, president of Warner Bros. Consumer Products, expressed hope that [...] "We're still going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> with Speed Racer", acknowledging that [...] "a giant movie would have made it all a lot bigger".|$|E
500|$|A live match {{audience}} witnessed Arsenal trounce Nottingham Forest at the City Ground {{in early}} November. Steve Bould, Brian Marwood Adams, Smith each scored {{as the team}} {{came back from a}} goal behind to win. [...] "It was a performance of true quality which must have made excellent viewing," [...] was Graham's verdict and he described it as [...] "satisfying" [...] to beat Forest at their home ground. Arsenal were not at their fluent best against Newcastle United though came away from St James' Park with a cleansheet and a 1–0 win – Bould scored for the second successive match. Paul Merson scored twice against Middlesbrough as Arsenal recorded a 3–0 win and moved into second place, just two points behind Norwich City. Arsenal's five England internationals, who featured against Saudi Arabia a week before, were lauded in The Times for their performances, despite playing tamely for country. The match reporter suggested the club versus country dilemma could be solved by including more Arsenal players, something Graham was sceptical about when put to him. [...] "I want England <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> It's just I want Arsenal to do better," [...] he said. Arsenal's unbeaten run came to an end against Derby County, where at the Baseball Ground a debatable penalty was awarded to the home side which allowed them {{to get back into the}} game.|$|E

Upon the song's release {{as an official}} single, Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented its choice {{for the promotion of}} Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that the singer could have chosen [...] "Breakin' Dishes" [...] which served as a promotional single for Good Girl Gone Bad and charted at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in February 2008—but had opted for [...] "Take a Bow" [...] due to it being new and more likely to find a receptive audience. Levine continued in his review to write that although the ballad succeeds in its mission of telling of a failed relationship, he noted that the song was not at the same level as the singer's previous single, [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] (2007). Levine cited that his reason for this was that [...] "'Take a Bow' does what it sets out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music". Levine also commented on the song with regard to the other new songs included on the re-release, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] (a collaboration with Maroon 5), as part of his review of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is inferior to the former, but superior to the latter.

The CA uses the learner’s response to suggest an appropriate topic (theories, life/people, or both depending on stated preference).

This somewhat amazed me, but as I had never spoken in public before I was rather in a flutter. However, I conquered my girlish shyness, and if the audience was not large it was enthusiastic. When I came to the peroration about wishing them all happy endings and real beginnings of true life, don't you know, the audience actually rose at me, and cheered like anything. Then someone proposed, [...] "Three cheers for young Warren," [...] and they gave them like mad; I did not know why, nor did he: he looked quite pale.

At last we got out by a back way, where our cab was waiting. Young Mr. Warren was as puzzled as myself, and his father was greatly overcome and sobbing in a corner.

6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} what I said, my dear. 'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad {{there was never any}} thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you, my dear!--And not a {{creature}} knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out. 'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity HER. And I must say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and {{said he did not know}} what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly." ...|$|E
