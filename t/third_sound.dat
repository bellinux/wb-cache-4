5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as <b>third</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, if a 530Hz {{pure tone}} is {{presented}} to a subject's right ear, while a 520Hz pure tone {{is presented to}} the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, {{in addition to the}} two pure-tones presented to each ear. The <b>third</b> <b>sound</b> is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10Hz, that being the difference between the 530Hz and 520Hz pure tones presented to each ear.|$|E
25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a <b>third</b> <b>sound.</b> The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E

60|$|She shivered. Now she was {{determined}} to go to sleep; there could be nothing else left to be heard or to imagine--it was horrid that her imagination should be so restless.

60|$|Fast and eagerly the Paladin rode for St. Andrews, {{with his}} squire and the {{trembling}} damsel, {{who was now}} agitated for new reasons, though the knight gave her assurances of his protection. They were {{not far from the}} city when they found people talking of a champion who had certainly arrived, but whose name was unknown, and his face constantly concealed by his visor. Even his own squire, it seems, did not know him; for the man had but lately been taken into his service. Rinaldo, as soon as he entered the city, left the damsel in a place of security, and then spurred his horse to the scene of action, when he found the accuser and the champion in the very midst of the fight. The Paladin, whose horse, notwithstanding the noise of the combat, had been heard coming like a tempest, and whose sudden and heroical appearance turned all eyes towards him, rode straight to the royal canopy, and, begging the king to stop the combat, disclosed the whole state of the matter, to the enchantment of all present, except the Duke of Albany; for the villain himself was on horseback there in state as grand constable, and had been feasting his miserable soul with the hope of seeing Ginevra condemned. The combatants were soon changed. Instead of Lurcanio and the unknown champion (whom the new comer had taken care to extol for his generosity), it was the Paladin and the Duke that were opposed; and horribly did the latter's heart fail him. But he had no remedy. Fight he must. Rinaldo, desirous to make short work of him, took his station with fierce delight; and at the <b>third</b> <b>sound</b> of the trumpets, the Duke was forced to couch his spear and meet him at full charge. Sheer went the Paladin's ashen staff through the false bosom, sending the villain to the earth eight feet beyond the saddle. The conqueror dismounted instantly, and unlacing the man's helmet, enabled the king to hear his dying confession, which he had hardly finished, when life forsook him. Rinaldo then took off his own helmet; and the king, who had seen the great Paladin before, and who felt more rejoiced at his daughter's deliverance than if he had lost and regained his crown, lifted up his hands to heaven, and thanked God for having honoured her innocence with so illustrious a defender.|$|E

50|$|It is well known, {{that when}} two {{consonant}} sounds are heard together, a <b>third</b> <b>sound</b> {{results from the}} coincidences of their vibrations; and that this <b>third</b> <b>sound,</b> which is called the grave harmonic, is always equal to unity, when the two primitive sounds are represented by the lowest integral numbers.

In western classical music, this usually means music written prior to the 15th century.|$|R
