5|$|On March 31, 2009, a {{full-length}} DVD-quality workprint {{of the film}} without a <b>timecode</b> or watermark, with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, and alternate sound effects was leaked online. The studio {{said it would be}} able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the workprint. The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting. Fox estimated the workprint was downloaded roughly 4.5million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters. As of 2014, Fox estimates that a minimum of 15 million people downloaded it.|$|E
25|$|Some {{programs}} may be prepared {{in their entirety}} several hours before broadcast, but with insufficient time to prepare a timecoded caption file for automatic play-out. Pre-prepared captions look similar to offline captions, although the accuracy of cueing may be compromised slightly as the captions are not locked to program <b>timecode.</b>|$|E
25|$|South African psytrance {{is a form}} of darker {{psychedelic}} trance {{music that}} started and is produced mostly in South Africa. Unlike the Russian dark psytrance, South African psytrance is more rhythmic, melodic and danceable, yet keeps the 'nasty-like' attitude. Notable record labels include <b>Timecode</b> Records, Mind Manipulation Device and Nano Records.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Timecodes</b> are {{generated}} {{as a continuous}} stream of sequential data values. In some applications [...] "wall clock" [...] time is used, in others the time encoded is a notional time. After making a series of recordings, or after crude editing, recorded <b>timecodes</b> may consist of discontinuous segments.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Timecoded</b> {{audio signal}} pressed onto vinyl/CD {{picked up by}} vinyl/CD {{turntable}} ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} <b>timecodes,</b> the {{components}} are encoded in straight binary, not binary-coded decimal.|$|R
25|$|Like SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M {{supports}} the SMPTE 291M standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; {{it is used}} for things such as embedded audio, closed captions, <b>timecode,</b> and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload.|$|E
25|$|For {{portions}} of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, {{it is recommended that}} the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0mV. It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval <b>timecode</b> or vertical interval test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the digital interface.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{professional}} subtitlers usually {{work with}} specialized computer {{software and hardware}} where the video is digitally stored on a hard disk, making each individual frame instantly accessible. Besides creating the subtitles, the subtitler usually also tells the computer software the exact positions where each subtitle should appear and disappear. For cinema film, this task is traditionally done by separate technicians. The end result is a subtitle file containing the actual subtitles as well as position markers indicating where each subtitle should appear and disappear. These markers are usually based on <b>timecode</b> {{if it is a}} work for electronic media (e.g., TV, video, DVD), or on film length (measured in feet and frames) if the subtitles are to be used for traditional cinema film.|$|E
50|$|The xwax {{source code}} {{is used to}} decode <b>timecodes</b> for vinyl control in Mixxx.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} vertical {{blanking interval}} lines are typically used for datacasting or ancillary data such as video editing timestamps (vertical interval <b>timecodes</b> or SMPTE <b>timecodes</b> on lines 12-14), test data on lines 17-18, a network source code on line 20 and closed captioning, XDS, and V-chip data on line 21. Early teletext applications also used {{vertical blanking interval}} lines 14-18 and 20, but teletext over NTSC was never widely adopted by viewers.|$|R
50|$|This {{will yield}} lyrics that are {{synchronized}} to the music, as most lyric files contain <b>timecodes</b> {{in addition to}} the lyric text.|$|R
25|$|For {{the audio}} and sound {{engineering}} on the tour, DiGiCo SD7 consoles {{were used by}} mixing specialists Andy Meyer and monitor engineers Matt Napier and Sean Spuehler. Since Madonna wanted to have an authentic feel with the live sound, Spuehler mixed her vocal effects and then added it to the house consoles. During {{the duration of the}} concert, the singer ventures {{into the middle of the}} crowd as the runway approaches, resulting in the spill of the microphone in her hand constantly changing. The sound crew employed <b>timecode</b> to achieve this, whereby like the lighting and the choreography, the sound feed also changed depending on where the singer was onstage. All the musicians accompanying Madonna wore in-ear monitor, with additional monitoring for musical director/keyboardist Kevin Antunes, a thumper for drummer Brian Frasier-Moore and sidefills for the dancers. All the inputs from the different personnel including Madonna were fed into the SD7 console. A Multichannel Audio Digital Interface(MADI) was used to record all the shows to a digital audio workstation in RAID drives. They were archived into four terabyte backup disks.|$|E
500|$|Like the IRIG <b>timecode,</b> {{the time}} {{transmitted}} {{is the time}} of the start of the minute.|$|E
500|$|Also {{like the}} IRIG <b>timecode,</b> numeric data (minute, hour, day of year, and last two digits of year) are sent in binary-coded decimal (BCD) format {{rather than as}} simple binary integers: ...|$|E
5000|$|The SMPTE {{family of}} <b>timecodes</b> are almost universally used in film, {{video and audio}} production, and can be encoded in many {{different}} formats, including: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} <b>timecodes</b> {{defined in}} the Standard have alphabetic designations. A, B, D, E, G, and H are the standards currently defined by IRIG Standard 200-04.|$|R
5000|$|In filmmaking {{and video}} production, shot logging {{is the process}} by which shoot {{metadata}} is captured during a film or video shoot. During the shoot, the camera assistant typically logs the start and end <b>timecodes</b> of shots, and the data generated is sent on to the editorial department for use in referencing those shots. At the same time, information such as scene/slate number, camera ID and take is noted. Where there are other technical systems producing metadata, their <b>timecodes</b> and settings are also noted.|$|R
500|$|Live {{shows on}} Tool's {{headline}} tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display. Keenan and Carey {{line up in}} the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No followspots or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage [...] "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, [...] " [...] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." [...] The big screens are used to play back [...] "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of <b>timecode.</b> They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice." [...] During the 10,000 Days tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD Disturb the Normal.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Spears hired Wade Robson, who had {{previously}} worked as director for her Dream Within a Dream Tour, to direct the tour; he announced that rehearsals would start in January. His wife, Amanda Robson, was also hired as co-creative director. Andre Fuentes {{was chosen as the}} lead choreographer. However, on December 23, 2008, the Robsons and Fuentes were replaced due to unknown reasons by Jamie King, who previously collaborated with Spears in her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. He did the casting of the dancers and acrobats, and worked with Spears on the setlist and the choreography. King described the show saying it was [...] "sexy, fun, explosive, and full of surprises. While avoiding such traditional circus elements as live animals, we've created something innovative and exciting using contortionists, dancers, lighting, fire and other special effects". Simon Ellis was hired as the musical director. The production design was done by Road Rage, a formed alliance between Nick Whitehouse, Bryan Leitch, William Baker and Steve Dixon. Lightning design was done by Visual Light, conformed by Whitehouse and Leitch. The stage was designed by Road Rage and set in-the-round, with a big stage in the center painted to look like a target. There were also two satellite stages in the sides unified by small catwalks, to resemble an actual three-ring circus. The stage was built by Tait Towers and included nine lifts, which had a cost of $10million. It traveled in 3,000 rolling cases packed into 32 semis and a crew of 150 people was needed to set it up. There was a semi-transparent Element Labs Stealth cylinder screen above the stage, comprising 960 panels that Solotech built into custom frames. The backdrops were designed by Dirk Decooedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to Marilyn Manson's [...] "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" [...] and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. Props, including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two Photon Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took <b>timecode</b> for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, [...] "The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360˚ LED screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the final output so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers. There is also an astounding 3D preview of the stage and video screens in the software so you can control or re-program the show without being inside the arena bowl".|$|E
2500|$|Special vinyl records (or CDs/digital files {{played with}} CDJs) {{can be used}} with DJ {{software}} to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing turntablism techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as [...] "timecode", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the <b>timecode</b> signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing {{in the same way that}} the turntable manipulates the <b>timecode</b> record.|$|E
50|$|Other {{software}} {{developed by}} Cowon includes the iAUDIO LDB Manager, a small application for tagging music files with <b>timecoded</b> lyrics displayable on Cowon media players {{as well as}} in JetAudio.|$|R
50|$|Longitudinal and vertical-interval <b>timecodes</b> were {{developed}} in 1967 by EECO, an electronics company that developed video recorders, and later video production systems. EECO assigned its intellectual property to permit public use.|$|R
50|$|Use the “Lyric Maker” utility {{that comes}} bundled with JetAudio to write <b>timecoded</b> lyric data to your files. Alternatively, {{you can use}} the iAUDIO LDB Manager {{application}} intended for use with Cowon’s portable media players.|$|R
2500|$|Scores for the {{acoustic}} tracks were emailed to his Berlin scoring stage, and would require from four musicians {{to the full}} orchestra, with a maximum of 24 present at any one time. One of three conductors would also be required for any score that involved more than 6 musicians. Franke would direct recording sessions via six fibre optic digital telephone lines to transmit and receive video, music and the SMPTE <b>timecode.</b> The final edit and mixing of the tracks would take place in his Los Angeles studio. Initially concerned composing for an episodic television show could become [...] "annoying because of the repetition", Franke found the evolving characters and story of Babylon 5 afforded {{him the opportunity to}} continually [...] "push the envelope".|$|E
50|$|Conversely, CTL <b>timecode</b> is an {{absolute}} <b>timecode</b> with specific digital references for every frame of video. Thus, a tape with CTL <b>timecode</b> can always display current <b>timecode</b> position accurately, even if the tape is moved from one machine to another. CTL <b>timecode</b> embedding can be transferred when making a copy, {{as long as the}} recording machine supports CTL <b>timecode.</b> Because CTL <b>timecode</b> is SMPTE <b>timecode,</b> its <b>timecode</b> can be interchanged with other SMPTE <b>timecode</b> schemes, like VITC and LTC (linear, audio track) <b>timecode,</b> as well as SMPTE <b>timecode</b> devices like <b>timecode</b> readers, generators, window dub inserters, MIDI synchronizers, and edit controllers.|$|E
5000|$|The RC <b>timecode</b> is a {{different}} technology than the SMPTE <b>timecode,</b> Linear <b>timecode</b> (LTC), and Vertical interval <b>timecode</b> (VITC).|$|E
50|$|Like most {{audiovisual}} <b>timecodes</b> such as SMPTE time code, it encodes {{only time}} of day, repeating each 24 hours. Time {{is given in}} units of hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. There may be 24, 25, or 30 frames per second.|$|R
50|$|Deckadance is {{available}} in two different editions. The House Edition can host VST compliant effects and can be controlled via a MIDI controller. The Club Edition contains all {{of the features of}} the House Edition, in addition to support for <b>timecoded</b> vinyls.|$|R
5000|$|... "Plumstones" [...] (10 September 1984) — Various unfortunate coincidences {{bring about}} Tom Chance's arrest. A <b>timecoded</b> pilot version also exists and is {{included}} on the DVD as an extra. This version has a differently-scripted and acted second half, although the ending is similar.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to the way}} VITC <b>timecode</b> is {{embedded}} in the vertical interval area of a video signal, CTL <b>timecode</b> embeds SMPTE <b>timecode</b> in the control track area of helical scan video recordings. The advantage of both VITC and CTL <b>timecode</b> is that a precious audio track {{does not have to be}} sacrificed for linear <b>timecode.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Timecode</b> {{can also}} be {{superimposed}} on video using a dedicated overlay device, often called a [...] "window dub inserter". This inputs a video signal and its separate <b>timecode</b> audio signal, reads the <b>timecode,</b> superimposes the <b>timecode</b> display over the video, and outputs the combined display (usually via composite), all in real time. Stand-alone <b>timecode</b> generator / readers often have the window dub function built-in.|$|E
50|$|CTL <b>timecode</b> (control track longitudinal): SMPTE <b>timecode</b> {{embedded}} in the control track of a video tape.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{an updated}} version of Traktor Pro, and {{a new version of the}} DJ studio, Traktor Scratch Pro were released. Traktor Scratch Pro had {{additional}} DVS functionality enabled, includes the specifically designed Audio 8 DJ audio interface, and <b>timecoded</b> CD or vinyl control.|$|R
5000|$|Deckadance can be {{controlled}} using a mouse, keyboard, CD system, MIDI controller, {{or in the case}} of the Club Edition, <b>timecoded</b> vinyl. The program uses a MIDI auto detection system. Deckadance works with vinyl and CDs <b>timecoded</b> with software such as Stanton FinalScratch, Serato Scratch Live, VirtualDJ (CD only), MixVibes, msPinky, PCDJ Reflex and Torq, and Deckadance CD. Through an [...] "autolearning system," [...] Image-Line claims the program can use essentially all CD and vinyl controllers on the market. When using vinyl, the program distinguishes between [...] "absolute mode", which allows for needle dropping and jump track position from the vinyl, and [...] "relative mode", which doesn't. Both modes allow for scratching and the manual control of playback speed and direction.|$|R
50|$|CinemaDNG, {{published}} September 2009: CinemaDNG uses DNG {{for each}} frame {{of a movie}} clip. There are additional tags specifically for movies: <b>TimeCodes</b> and FrameRate. It {{is not clear whether}} these tags will be added to a later version of the DNG specification, or will remain separately described only in the CinemaDNG specification.|$|R
