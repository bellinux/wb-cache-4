5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Lindwall and his {{elder brother}} Jack were spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the First Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series. The series saw the usage of the notorious Bodyline tactics by England's pace battery led by Harold Larwood under the {{captaincy}} of Douglas Jardine. Larwood, a small man like Lindwall, was less than six feet and intimidated opposition batsmen with express pace bowling, aiming short pitched bouncers at their upper body. Larwood also had a smooth, rhythmic run-up and a classical side-on action, something for which Lindwall became famous. The match was also remembered for Stan McCabe's much-celebrated 187 not out, aggressively resisting the Bodyline tactics as Australia fell to a heavy ten wicket defeat.|$|E

Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes {{the wind out of}} the Buffland action, and soon most are back at work, though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Lord Harris {{expressed}} his {{view that the}} painting should show an action shot of a match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, and suggested that the bowler in the painting should be Kent's Colin Blythe.

That match was part of the Canterbury Cricket Week, and Blythe had taken eight wickets, making it the most appropriate of the three fixtures to depict. Tayler decided that he would show <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the match, at an hour prior to lunchtime.|$|E
