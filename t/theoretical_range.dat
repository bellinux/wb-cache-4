The normal range using the main fuel tanks was 4245 miles (6830km). In March 1941 the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics asked the Naval Aircraft Factory for a catapult able to launch a PBB-1. The NAF duly prepared a design for a Mark VII catapult that {{would be able to}} launch a fifty-ton PBB-1 at a speed of 130 miles per hour. The catapult would be installed so that the flying boat could be lifted onto it with a large crane or hydraulic jacks. However, in the summer of 1942, while development of the Mk.VII catapult was still ongoing, the Navy cancelled the project because it considered JATO assistance at takeoff more practical.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the nonlinear system identification of model parameters for a capacitive dual-backplate MEMS microphone. System {{parameters of the}} microphone are developed by lumped element modeling (LEM) and a governing nonlinear equation is thereafter obtained with coupled mechanical and electrostatic nonlinearities. The approximate solution for a general damped second order system with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearities and a non-zero external step loading is explored by the multiple time scales method. Then nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to verify {{the accuracy of the}} lumped stiffnesses of the diaphragm. The microphone is characterized and nonlinear least-squares technique is implemented to identify system parameters from experimental data. Finally uncertainty analysis is performed. The experimentally identified natural frequency and nonlinear stiffness parameter fall into their <b>theoretical</b> <b>ranges</b> for a 95 % confidence level respectively.

Stems with head-neck ratio lower than 2. 3 and neck shaft angle greater than 135 did not impinge.

40|$|A novel {{temperature}} sensor based on nematic liquid crystal permittivity as a sensing magnitude, is presented. This sensor {{consists of a}} specific micrometric structure that gives considerable advantages from other previous related liquid crystal (LC) sensors. The analytical study reveals that permittivity change with temperature is introduced in a hyperbolic cosine function, increasing the sensitivity term considerably. The experimental data has been obtained for ranges from − 6 °C to 100 °C. Despite this, following the LC datasheet, <b>theoretical</b> <b>ranges</b> from − 40 °C to 109 °C could be achieved.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe effect of bottom backscatter on target detection ranges for 100 -kHz Klein and EG&G side scan sonars was investigated. Glass spheres of 16 -cm diameter with measured target strengths of - 24 dB were deployed in 30 -m water depth, 0. 7 m above sand and shale bottoms. Controlled test runs past a linear target configuration were performed. For a sand bottom, the Klein system yielded target detections at a maximum range of 150 m with 100 % success. The EG&G system yielded 100 % detection out to 152 -m range, with detection 46 % {{of the time}} at 259 m and 865 % at 228 m. A shale bottom masked all target returns negating detection.
