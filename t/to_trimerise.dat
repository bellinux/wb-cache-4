30|$|Isocyanates are {{generally}} produced {{during the early}} stages of fire (Woolley 1972). Some of the PU based insulation materials are highly flammable and can spread the flame fast when ignited (Marlair et al. 1993). The flammability of PUR, and in particular PUR foams, is strongly dependant on the structure of the polyol as well as the isocyanate used and their ratio (Levchik & Weil 2004). Another highly important factor for the flammability and flame spread is the density of the foam, where highly porous, lightweight materials tend to have a fast combustion and flame propagation rate as well as a high thermal radiation (Levchik & Weil 2004; Lefebvre et al. 2004). One approach to reducing the flammability of PUR foams is to add more isocyanate to the formulation before polymerisation, in order to allow the isocyanate <b>to</b> <b>trimerise,</b> forming an isocyanurate ring, of higher thermal stability than the urethane or other linkages (Dominguez-Rosado et al. 2002; Ashida et al. 1997).|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} death {{receptor}} family induced apoptosis has gained momentum {{in recent years}} {{with the knowledge that}} therapeutic antibodies targeting DR 4 and DR 5 (death receptor’s 4 and 5) have proved efficacious in multiple clinical trials. The therapeutic rationale is based on targeting and amplifying a tumour tissues normal cell death programme (apoptosis). While advances in the targeting of DR 4 and DR 5 have been successful the search for an agonistic antibody to another family member, the Fas receptor, has proven more elusive. This is partly due to the differing in vitro and in vivo characteristics of individual antibodies. In order to induce Fas targeted cell death an antibody must be capable of binding <b>to</b> and <b>trimerising</b> the receptor. It has been shown that antibodies capable of performing this function in vivo, with the assistance of tumour associated cells, do not always induce apoptosis in vitro. As a result the use of current methodologies to detect functional antibodies in vitro may have dismissed potential therapeutic candidates (‘false negative’). Here we report a novel high throughput screening technique which artificially cross-links antibodies bound to the Fas receptor. By combining this process with Annexin-V and Prodidium Iodide (PI) staining we can select for antibodies which have the potential to induce apoptosis in vivo...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with spatially anisotropic nearest-neighbour exchange couplings on the kagome net, i. e. with coupling J in one lattice direction and couplings J' along the other two directions. For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magnetic properties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits two kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' 1 / 2. To include quantum effects self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin perturbation expansion <b>to</b> the <b>trimerised</b> version of the original spin- 1 / 2 model leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet, which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{presents}} a review {{on the structure}} and reactivity of Beta-diketonate metal chelates. In chapter 2 the reaction of various rhodium(I) and iridium(I) Beta-ketoenolates with the electrophilic acetylenes hexafluorobut- 2 -yne and dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate are described. Complexes of the type Rh(cod) (Beta-ketoenolate), which contain electron-donating substituents on the metal Beta-ketoenolate ring, react with C 4 F 6 to give complexes in which the fluorocarbon adds 1, 4 to the rhodium(I) (Beta-ketoenolate) ring. Also the hexafluorobut- 2 -yne is <b>trimerised</b> <b>to</b> hexakis (trifluoromethyl) benzene which remains co-ordinated to the rhodium so that the diene ligand is displaced. Similar 1, 4 addition adducts are isolated from the reaction of C 4 F 6 with complexes of the type Rh(olefin) 2 (Beta-ketoenolate), although Rh(C 2 H 4) 2 (dpm) reacts with this acetylene to form a 1, 4 addition adduct which contains a 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrakistrifluoromethylcyclohexa- 1, 3 -diene ligand. 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropyne is polymerised in similar reactions. Compounds of the type Rh(C 2 F 4) (L) (dpm) where L = AsPh 3 or SbPh 3 react with the acetylenes hexafluorobut- 2 -yne, dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate and dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate to give metallocyclopentadienes of the type Rh(C 4 R 4) (L) (dpm). Dipivaloylmethanatodicarbonylrhodium(I) reacts with hexafluoro- but- 2 -yne and dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate to give dinuclear adducts which contain two units formed by the acetylene adding 1, 4 to the metal chelate ring, two carbonyl ligands and a bridging o-bonded acetylene ligand. Hexafluorobut- 2 -yne reacts with Ir(cod) (acac) and Ir(cod) (dpm) to give an iridiacyclopentene complex in which the acetylene has also added 1, 4 to the iridium Beta-ketoenolate ring. In contrast, hexafluorobut- 2 -yne adds 1, 4 to the co-ordinated cyclo-octa- 1, 5 -diene in [Rh(cod) C 1] 2. Chapter 3 contains the results of some investigations into the reactivity of some palladium(II) Beta-ketoenolate complexes towards hexafluorobut- 2 -yne and dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate. Hexafluoro-but- 2 -yne reacts with bis(acetylacetonato) palladium(II) to give the complex Pd[-O=C(CH 3) CH(COCH 3) C(CF 3) =C(CF 3) ] 2 in which the acetylene links the y-CH of the Beta-diketonato ligands to the palladium. Similar reaction does not occur with dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate. The preparation and spectroscopic properties of some complexes of the type (N,N-dimethylbenzylamine- 2 C,N) palladium(B-ketoenolate) are described together with their reaction toward the acetylenes C 4 F 6 and CH 3 O 2 CC=CCO 2 CH 3. In general, complexes of the type Pd(dmba) (Beta-ketoenolate) containing electron-donating substituents on the metal Beta-ketoenolate ring react with these acetylenes to give square planar complexes in which the acetylene links the y-CH of the Beta-diketonate to the metal, whilst Beta-ketoenolates containing electron withdrawing substituents on the ring induce the acetylenes to insert into the palladium carbon bond of the orthometallated amine. The spectroscopic properties of these insertion products are discussed. Chapter 4 discusses {{the preparation of the}} fluoro-olefin complexes Rh(dpm) (C 2 H 4) (CF 2 =CFX) where X = F, CF 3, C 1 or Br. Reaction of these complexes with triphenyl-phosphine, -arsine or -stibine results in displacement of ethylene and the formation of complexes of the type Rh(dpm) (CF 2 =CFX) L. 19 F n. m. r. studies on these complexes are consistent with structures in which the substituent X in these compounds is in an outside position with respect to the ethylene or ligand L...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{presents}} {{an outline of}} the bonding in [special character omitted]-bonded acetylene complexes of metals, and also contains a survey of mono-acetylene complexes of four Group VIII metal systems [...] -rhodium(I), iridium(I), palladium(O) and platinum(O). In chapter 2, some reactions of rhodium(I) -[special character omitted]-ketoenolate complexes with the electrophilic acetylene hexafluorobut- 2 -yne are described. Compounds of the type (Rh([special character omitted]-ketoenolate) (C 2 H 4) 2) as well as (Rh(apeo) (C 2 H 4) 2) (Rh(apemino) (C 2 H 4) 2), react with C 4 F 6 to give products in which the acetylene adds 1, 4 across the rhodium-chelate ring. In addition, the C 4 F 6 is either <b>trimerised</b> <b>to</b> give a hexakis (trifluoromethyl) benzene ring, or dimerised, with incorporation of ethylene, to a 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrakis-(trifluoromethyl) cyclohexa- 1, 3 -diene ligand. These ligands become coordinated to the rhodium, with the [special character omitted]-bonded ethylene ligands being displaced, and {{it is found that}} the basicity of the chelating anion is influential in determining which ligand is formed. With (Rh (acac) (C 8 H 14) 2), a 9, 10, 11, 12 -tetrakis(trifluoromethyl) -bicyclo(6, 4, 0) dodeca- 9, 11 -diene ligand is formed by combination of two C 4 F 6 molecules and one cyclo-octene molecule. Low temperature (- 78 C) reactions of C 4 F 6 with the compounds (Rh ([special character omitted]-ketoenolate) (olefin) 2) give a new class of complexes, (Rh ([special character omitted]-ketoenolate) (olefin) (C 4 F 6)), containing both a [special character omitted]-bonded olefin and a [special character omitted]-bonded acetylene ligand. These complexes are probable intermediates in the room temperature formation of cyclohexa- 1, 3 -diene and bicyclododeca- 9, 11 -diene ligands, and may also be involved in the build-up of the benzene-type ligands. The crystal structures of two of these compounds, (Rh (acac) (C 2 H 4) (C 4 F 6)) and (Rh (acac) (C 8 H 14) (C 4 F 6)) are described. Starting from (Rh (dpm) (C 2 H 4) (C 4 F 6)), a series of complexes (Rh (dpm) (Eph 3) 2 (C 4 F 6)) (E = P,As,Sb) can be prepared; it is found that one of the Eph 3 ligands is dissociated in chloroform solution. A preliminary investigation of the reactions of (Rh (dpm) (C 2 H 4) (C 4 F 6)) with other acetylenes is also reported. Chapter 3 contains the results of an investigation into the reactions of phenylhaloacetylenes with complexes of platinum(O), palladium(O), rhodium(I) and iridium(I). These results are compared with those obtained for halo-olefins, which have been previously reported. In the case of phenylhaloacetylenes, the products are largely metal-acetylide complexes, many of them previously unknown. Two [special character omitted]-bonded acetylene complexes are obtained, these being (Pt (PPh 3) 2 (PhC=CCl)) and (RhCl (PPh 3) 2 (PhC=CCl)), and gentle warming of these in hydroxylic solvents results in isomerisation to metal-acetylide compounds. In chapter 4 the kinetics of these two metal-acetylene to metal-acetylide isomerisations are described. In both cases, the reaction is found to exhibit considerably more intramolecular character than is found for metal-olefin to metal-vinyl rearrangements. This result is related to the greater strength of the carbon-halogen bond being broken in acetylene-acetylide isomerisation. Chapter 5 discusses the preparation of some platinum and palladium acetylide and [special character omitted]-allene complexes containing dimethyl- dithiocarbamate as a ligand. In the case of the palladium complex, (Pd (dmdtc) (C=CPh) (PPh 3)), stable products, involving insertion of the acetylene into the palladium-carbon bond, are formed in reactions with hexafluorobut- 2 -yne and dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate. No reactions occur {{in the case of the}} platinum analogue. These results are compared with those for reactions of the acetylenes with (PdX (C=CPh) (PPh 3) 2) (X = halogen), in which no stable mono-insertion products are formed, although multiple insertion into the palladium-carbon bond may be occurring. Reaction of C 4 F 6 with (Pd (HC=C=CH 2) (dmdtc) (PPh 3)) is postulated to give a product derived from insertion of the acetylene into the palladium-[special character omitted]-allene bond, followed by rearrangement of the allene moiety to an acetylenic group...|$|R
40|$|Based on new {{methodology}} for nitration of pyridine and pyridine derivatives developed at our department by Professor Jan Bakke and coworkers at NTNU, {{a whole range}} of substituted nitropyridines are now readily available. The method provides new possibilities in heterocyclic chemistry for the preparation of new materials. Due to the importance and useful properties of many pyridine-based compounds, the chemistry of nitropyridine derivatives is being investigated by our group at NTNU and results for nitropyridine carbamates, amides and carboxylates are presented in this thesis. These nitropyridine derivatives have been used as substrates for the formation of new bisheterocyclic compounds and pyridine derivatives. New synthetic routes to fused heterocycles have been developed. Chapter 2 and Paper I presents the preparation, stability and reactivity of nitropyridine isocyanates (13, 23), a new class of compounds in organic chemistry. The introduction of an electronegative substituent represented by the nitro group was expected to reduce the basisity of the pyridine nitrogen, hence decrease the rate of dimerisation and increase the reactivity of the isocyanate carbon towards a nucleophile. The preparation of nitropyridine isocyanates (13, 23) are reported. Isocyanates constitute an important class of compounds in organic chemistry and undergo a series of reactions to yield a variety of interesting products includingheterocyclic derivatives. Heterocyclic isocyanates, however, have not received the same attention as the respective aromatic compounds in synthesis and reactivity studies because of their instability and high reactivity. 2 -Pyridine isocyanate dimerises while the 4 -isomer <b>trimerises</b> <b>to</b> form the trimer. Chapter 3 and Paper I presents the preparation, stability and reactivity of the isocyanate dimer and trimer. The isocyanate dimer (28) was formed in high yield from the reactive 5 -nitro- 2 -pyridine isocyanate (23) by a [2 + 4]-cycloaddition reaction. Another byproduct in the preparation of the isocyanate using oxalyl chloride was the tetrone (26). The isocyanate trimer was formed from the unstable 4 -pyridine isocyanate for reference purposes. The trimer proved to be less stable than previously reported and afforded 4 -aminopyridine and methyl 4 -pyridine carbamate as decomposition products in the presence of moisture and alcohols, respectively. This demonstrates that the reactive trimer {{can be used as a}} protected version of the isocyanate for synthetic purposes. Chapter 4 and Paper II presents studies of the nitropyridine isocyanates in cycloaddition reactions. The reactivity of the nitropyridine isocyanates in 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reactions with trimethylsilylazide and 3, 5 -dimethylpyridine N-oxide to afford tetrazolinones (41, 43) and substituted amines (52, 55) was investigated. A [2 + 4]-cycloaddition reaction of nitropyridine isocyanate with diphenylketene was also studied. The cycloadduct (59) was formed. These results demonstrate the potential of the nitropyridine isocyanates to undergo cycloaddition reactions. Application of nitropyridine carbamates, amides and carboxylates in the formation of new heterocyclic compounds have been investigated and discussed in Chapter 5 - 7. Chapter 5 and Paper III presents the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction of the nitro group of methyl 3 -nitro- 4 -pyridine carboxylate. The nitro group was successfully replaced by nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles to afford the substitution products (16 a-d) in moderate yields. Chapter 6 and Paper IV presents the cyclization reaction of nitropyridine carbamates for the formation of 1, 3 -dihydro- 2 H-imidazo[4, 5 -c]pyridin- 2 -one (79 a-b), a biologically active compound. A facile acid-catalysed cyclization method for the preparation of the cyclic urea by traditional heating and the corresponding microwave-promoted reaction were developed. Both methods afforded the cyclic urea in high yield and represent a “green method” for the preparation of this compound. Chapter 7 and Paper V presents the preparation of 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazol [4, 5 -c]pyridine (86) and N-acyl and N-alkoxycarbonyl triazolo[4, 5 -c]pyridine derivatives (96 a-e, 98 a-e). The triazolopyridine derivatives were readily formed by diazotization and cyclization of the respective nitropyridine carbamates and amides in high yields. The application of triazolo[4, 5 -c]pyridine derivatives (98 a-e) in the acylation of amines and amino acids was investigated. They proved to be more effective than the commercially available benzotriazole and afforded the protected amines in high yields under mild conditions. PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|R
