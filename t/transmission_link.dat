5|$|On November 18, 2010, Dunderdale and Premier Williams {{were joined}} by Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter in announcing a $6.2billion {{agreement}} to develop {{the first phase of}} the Lower Churchill Project. Nalcor Energy, a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation, signed a partnership agreement with Emera Inc. of Nova Scotia to develop the 824megawatts Muskrat Falls. The hydro development would see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater <b>transmission</b> <b>link</b> through the Strait of Belle Isle. Another underwater <b>transmission</b> <b>link</b> across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia. Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil-burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station. Emera Inc. will get 20% of the power for $1.2billion to sell to customers in Nova Scotia. The remaining 40 percent will be sold by Nalcor Energy to markets in Atlantic Canada and the Northeastern United States.|$|E

30|$|Figure  7 {{illustrates}} how average downlink continuous service capacity changes under the different number of UEs in a fixed area. From Fig.  7, {{we find that}} DTO-MROD outperforms LIKE-DORE {{in terms of this}} performance index. We attribute this advantage to two points. Firstly, the energy constraints are considered in DTO-MROD, and thus, the selected relays have higher battery level than those in LIKE-DORE. Secondly, for DTO-MROD, the UEs near the edge of cells trend to select two relays to transfer data, which leads to the shorter <b>transmission</b> <b>links</b> than that in LIKE-DORE. Therefore, the receiving-ends of <b>transmission</b> <b>links</b> have lower BER and thus higher energy efficiency in the process of data transfer.|$|R

40|$|In virtual MIMO technology, {{distributed}} single-antenna radio systems cooperate on infor-mation {{transmission and}} reception as a multiple-antenna MIMO radio system. In this paper, a cooperative transmission scheme, virtual MIMO network formation and reconfiguration al-gorithms, and a cooperative routing backbone are cross-layered designed for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) to jointly achieve required reliability, energy efficiency and delay reduction. The proposed cooperative transmission scheme minimizes the number of intra communications among cooperative nodes. It can save energy and reduces latency at <b>transmission</b> <b>links</b> even when the distance between cooperative nodes is large. In the proposed routing backbone, en-ergy consumption and latency are optimized simultaneously along the route which leverages the MIMO advantages from local <b>transmission</b> <b>links</b> into the whole network. In order to apply the virtual MIMO technology to a general WSN, {{the number of the}} cooperative nodes and the length of <b>transmission</b> <b>links</b> are allowed to have heterogeneity. The proposed virtual MIMO radio network can be formed for any underlying WSN with low reconfiguration cost. The per-formance evaluation shows that the proposed design can fully realize the potential of the virtual MIMO technology and largely improve reliability, latency and energy consumption in a WSN...|$|R
