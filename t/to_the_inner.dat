5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming artillery fire aimed at the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.|$|E

5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus {{and the inner}} ear, the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear.

5|$|All of Neptune's inner moons {{are dark}} objects: their {{geometric}} albedo ranges from 7 to 10%.

5|$|Halley's returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System {{have been}} {{observed}} and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time.

5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E

5|$|No comets with an {{eccentricity}} {{significantly greater}} than one have been observed, {{so there are no}} confirmed observations of comets that are likely to have originated outside the Solar System. Comet C/1980 E1 had an orbital period of roughly 7.1 million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet. Comets not expected to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> Solar System include C/1980 E1, C/2000 U5, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), C/2009 R1, C/1956 R1, and C/2007 F1 (LONEOS).|$|E

5|$|On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to {{announce}} the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared {{on the order of}} 4000 years ago, but any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records.

5|$|The enzymes of the {{citric acid}} cycle {{are located in}} the {{mitochondrial}} matrix, with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, which is bound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> mitochondrial membrane as part of Complex II. The citric acid cycle oxidizes the acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, and, in the process, produces reduced cofactors (three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2) that are a source of electrons for the electron transport chain, and a molecule of GTP (that is readily converted to an ATP).|$|E

5|$|The three {{ossicles}} transmit {{sound from}} the outer ear <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear. The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum, where it is connected at its longest part (the manubrium or handle) by a ligament. It transmits vibrations to the incus, which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone. The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window. As the stapes vibrates, vibrations are transmitted through the oval window, causing movement of fluid within the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The {{three small}} {{bones in the}} middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> ear.

Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
