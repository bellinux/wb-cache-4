Lily tells Emma {{that she wants to}} find the {{identity}} of her father and plans on staying in Storybrooke during her search. Belle shows up to <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> that the last bit of humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcererâ€™s Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|E

Ian puts the restaurant up for sale to pay for the school, and though Kathy tries to encourage more trade at the restaurant, Ian accepts an offer from a supermarket chain, Costmart. Several weeks later, Ian worries he will regret selling the restaurant but Kathy reminds him he is doing it for Bobby and must <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> soon that Costmart is buying it, or she will.

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now he could <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E
