25|$|The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, draws {{heavily from}} Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw {{an elderly man}} walking on the sidepath outside {{the window of his}} home. The man stopped <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> a startled Craven and walked off. This served as the {{inspiration}} for Krueger. Initially, Fred Krueger was intended to be a child molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.|$|E

His pattern [...] began at the front, the engine's nose, and {{consistently}} ended in the cockpit. How {{he was able to}} do this not even he could explain. With every dogfight he would throttle back as far as possible; this enabled him to fly tighter turns. His expenditure of ammunition in this air battle was 360 rounds (60 per aircraft shot down) ...|$|E
500|$|During season finales, a song {{is played}} before the closing {{scene in a}} montage showing {{the lives of the}} protagonists in the {{aftermath}} of the narrative. The first season montage is played over [...] "Step by Step" [...] by Jesse Winchester, the second [...] "I Feel Alright" [...] by Steve Earle, the third [...] "Fast Train" [...] written by Van Morrison and performed by Solomon Burke, the fourth [...] "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" [...] written by Dr. John and performed by Paul Weller and the fifth uses an extended version of [...] "Way Down In The Hole" [...] by the Blind Boys of Alabama, the same version of the song used as the opening theme for the first season. While the songs reflect the mood of the sequence, their lyrics are usually only loosely tied to the visual shots. In the commentary track to episode 37, [...] "Mission Accomplished", executive producer David Simon said: [...] "I hate it when somebody purposely tries to have the lyrics match the visual. It brutalizes the visual in a way to have the lyrics dead on point.... Yet at the same time it can't be totally off point. It has <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> what you're trying to say." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{triumph of}} the Belyayev circle {{could be seen as}} the worst of both worlds from The Five and Tchaikovsky for two reasons. First, from Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, the Belyayevets {{realized}} the importance of a solid academic grounding, but they took the importance of their conservatory training to extremes, and devolved into academicism and [...] They failed to take into account that Tchaikovsky transcended what authority David Brown calls [...] "the heavy conditioning of his conservatory training" [...] through his [...] "innate Russianness and his love of his own country's folk music", and that Rimsky-Korsakov similarly transcended a period of extremely pedantic music writing to arrive at a more balanced style. Second, the Belyayevets got the idea from The Five of a school to which all members would adhere, but they took adherence to their school to the point of mediocrity, with [...] "a safe conformism" [...] becoming [...] "increasingly the rule". This was the point that composer César Cui, a former member of The Five, made in his article [...] "Fathers and Sons" [...] in 1888, when he wrote, [...] "Despite the frequent contact of all the fathers with one another, each of them preserved intact his individuality. It is enough <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> a single page of music by one of the fathers to say with certainty that it is the work of Borodin, Balakirev, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, or Korsakov. The music of the sons is the music of clones." [...] Taruskin adds, ...|$|E

2500|$|Head's {{unwillingness to}} be wrong was not always of benefit to him. One day a fellow of his, William Bullock, decided to test the extent of Head's 'omnipotence'. Asking the doctor at lunch whether he had read Hagenheimer's new book on {{locomotor}} ataxia. Head replied he had only had time <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> it. Bullock commented, [...] "Well, you have done better {{than the rest of}} us. There is no such book." [...] While this experience would appear more 'uncomfortable' than harmful, Head's need to be certain did prove a hindrance when his sensations were being tested by Rivers in their 'Human Experiment in Nerve Division'. As is written in the report, if Head concentrated too closely on the task, his anxieties about being right tended to make him give the wrong answer. It was only when he forgot completely about the experiment that he managed to be precise about his sensations.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{not within}} the scope of this paper, however, to discuss {{technical}} criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of confirmation. Our purpose is simply <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> several examples of a type of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific standards, {{but at the same time}} is the result of such intricate mental activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there are occasions when a scientific [...] "orthodoxy" [...] may delay the acceptance of novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of [...] "pseudo-science." [...] Since the time of Galileo the history of pseudo-science has been so completely outside the history of science that the two streams touch only in the rarest of instances.|$|E
2500|$|The Committee of Public Safety {{believed}} Léchelle combined [...] "audacity {{with the}} necessary talents to end the war". Unfortunately, {{he turned out to}} be worse than Rossignol who, though brave, was generally understood to be incompetent. When Léchelle arrived at headquarters at Montaigu, Kléber placed a map in front of him and explained the strategy of his predecessor Canclaux. Without bothering <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the map, Léchelle replied, [...] "On this terrain it is a question of display. One must march majestically and in mass". As Kléber quietly put away the map, the representative Antoine Merlin de Thionville declared that the government was appointing the most ignorant generals possible. After discussion, it was agreed that the Nantes and Mayence divisions would continue to march from the west toward Cholet where it would meet converging columns from Luçon and Les Sables d'Olonne in the south and from Bressuire in the east. After starting at La Châtaigneraie, Chalbos and François Joseph Westermann devastated the countryside as far as Bressuire where they were joined by columns from Saumur and Thouars, making a body of 20,000 soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared <b>to</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move! Fuck!” Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|E
