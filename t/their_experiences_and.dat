5|$|Ed Brubaker's uncle, John Paxton, was a noted Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s {{known for}} Murder, My Sweet, Crossfire, The Wild One and On the Beach. His wife, Sarah Jane Paxton, worked public {{relations}} for 20th Century Fox at the same time. They told Brubaker stories about <b>their</b> <b>experiences,</b> <b>and</b> he developed a lifelong fascination with the time and setting. In particular, {{he was drawn to}} the false personas he felt everyone had to put forward to succeed.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{introducing}} any revolutionary tactical doctrine, crews {{gradually became}} more experienced and increased their effectiveness that way, while specialist training was provided {{when it was}} required. Survival rates remained mediocre, owing {{to the nature of}} long-range operations over water. However, with greater innovations, such as radar, better designed aircraft, and more potent weaponry, the crews built on <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> the service became an effective naval air service.|$|E
5|$|The game {{developed}} a strong cult following, {{leading to a}} core modding and playing community that remained active over 15 years after its release. In an interview with IGN in June 2015, game director Warren Spector said he never expected Deus Ex to sell many copies, but he did expect it to become a cult classic among a smaller strong community, and he continues to receive fan mail from players to date regarding <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> thoughts about Deus Ex.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake as to <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former {{was taken from}} his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's motivation {{to make a new}} sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima. Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} {{researchers}} at experiment {{stations of the}} land-grant universities and USDA saw that adults in the farming community did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> successes with the adults. So rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.|$|E

25|$|One study, of first-year {{students}} {{in medical school}} writing in dialogue journals with their professors, found that the interactive journal writing “provided {{a safe place for}} students to describe <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>and</b> relationships and to question their own values and beliefs.” The process of writing in this way with their teachers broke down barriers between them, through a mutual sharing of thoughts and feelings, which led to enhanced rapport and communication, and thus facilitated students’ personal and reflective perspectives and initiated and encouraged self-awareness.|$|E
