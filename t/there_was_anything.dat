5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

He had earlier said that he remained convinced that the fire was “undoubtedly” started by accident by a discarded match or cigarette, despite the new evidence.|$|E
25|$|From the Hopkins Grammar School {{he went to}} Yale College, {{from which}} he was {{graduated}} with the class of 1861. There is scant information as to his four years at college. During that period he kept a diary from which he read extracts on the fifty-fifth reunion of his class, but this diary is not at present available. That the studious traits which he later manifested were not altogether lacking at this time may be inferred {{from the fact that}} he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Skull & Bones. Such records as we have do not indicate that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> unusual about this young student who had among his classroom contemporaries the poet Edward Rowland Sill, and two others who like himself were later to have much to do with the life of the university, his friends Tracy Peck and Franklin Bowditch Dexter.|$|E

25|$|Later Krishna told Arjuna how {{he could}} bring down Bhishma, through the help of Sikhandhi. The Pandavas were {{initially}} not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such cheap tactics {{they would not be}} following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who put his bow and arrows down. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Using Sikhandhi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> to get excited about, either. Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{politicians}} of his time, Harding accepted that patronage and graft {{would be used}} to repay political favors. He arranged for his sister Mary (who was legally blind) to be appointed asa teacher at the Ohio School for the Blind, although there were better-qualified candidates. In another trade, he offered publicity in his newspaper in exchange for free railroad passes for himself and his family. According to Sinclair, [...] "it is doubtful that Harding ever thought <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> dishonest in accepting the perquisites of position or office.

500|$|Truman {{had been}} vice {{president}} for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. That afternoon, Truman presided over the Senate as usual. He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage.

500|$|The Beatles {{auditioned for}} Martin on 6 June 1962, in studio three at the Abbey Road studios. Ron Richards and his {{engineer}} Norman Smith recorded four songs, which Martin (who {{was not present}} during the recording) listened to {{at the end of}} the session. The verdict was not promising, however, as Richards complained about Pete Best's drumming, and Martin thought their original songs were simply not good enough. Martin asked the individual Beatles if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> they personally did not like, to which George Harrison replied, [...] "Well, there's your tie, for a start." [...] That was the turning point, according to Smith, as John Lennon and Paul McCartney joined in with jokes and comic wordplay, that made Martin think that he should sign them to a contract for their wit alone.|$|E
500|$|Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic noted, [...] "'Concentrate and Ask Again'" [...] {{did little}} to drive the {{overriding}} story forward, but it did a brilliant job of making me question everything." [...] Nonetheless, she commented that it [...] "... was nowhere near as intense as 'Reciprocity'." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not think <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> [...] "particularly remarkable about the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some really interesting action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E

500|$|He checked {{himself out}} of the {{hospital}} and disappeared from his Florida home and was found five months later in a Charlotte, North Carolina, hospital with similar health complaints. Cook had been around Charlotte for five months and no one realized <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> wrong until he started developing stroke symptoms again. Doctors diagnosed his problems, which were not organic, and referred him to see the proper specialists. He claims to have had no recollection of leaving Florida, nor what he had done during his five months in Charlotte. When asked, he stated that, [...] "It was like someone switching off a light and then switching it back on." [...] Cook's story has been told through different media. The 700 Club did a full-length documentary about his life, which aired worldwide. Cook wrote a religious self-help book, Inspirational Words about the issues he overcame.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{directed}} by Kent Butterworth. Klasky-Csupo, the animation studio {{that produced the}} earlier Simpsons shorts, {{was in charge of}} the animation, with one exception. During the years of producing the shorts, everything was created in-house. As a budgetary consideration production was subcontracted to South Korean animation studio AKOM. While character and background layout was done in Los Angeles, inbetweening, coloring and filming is done by the overseas studio. A debacle erupted when this episode, the first to return from Korea, was screened in front of the production staff at the Gracie Films bungalow.

500|$|In July 2005, Thompson sent {{a letter}} to several {{politicians}} urging them to investigate The Sims 2, alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes. Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated [...] "T" [...] for Teen, a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older. Manufacturer Electronic Arts dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have [...] "no anatomical detail" [...] under their clothes, effectively resembling Barbie dolls. Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when taking a shower, Brown said that was for [...] "humorous effect" [...] and denied <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> improper about the game. Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the in-game console in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change.|$|E

500|$|Other {{evidence}} has surfaced illustrating Mölders' ambiguous {{relationship with the}} National Socialist regime. Mölders {{may have been in}} contact with bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen, who was highly critical of the Nazi regime. Von Galen publicly criticised the regime for the Gestapo's tactics and the deportation and euthanasia of the mentally ill. According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galen's secretary and chaplain, Mölders threatened to return his awards if von Galen's euthanasia accusation turned out to be true. Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked Mölders during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> he wished for. Mölders reportedly responded, [...] "Please leave the bishop of Münster alone." [...] Hitler assured him that [...] "Yes, nothing will happen to the bishop of Münster." [...] The MGFA concluded in 2004 that this story was most likely false. The MGFA revised its position again on 28 June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between Mölders and von Galen.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{recording}} contract was signed, the Beatles performed a [...] "commercial test" [...] (i.e. {{an evaluation of}} a signed artist) on 6 June 1962 in studio two at the Abbey Road studios.

Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition. [...] Fatima Jinnah later wrote, [...] "even in his hour of triumph, the Quaid-e-Azam was gravely ill... He worked in a frenzy to consolidate Pakistan. And, of course, he totally neglected his health..." [...] Jinnah worked with a tin of Craven [...] "A" [...] cigarettes at his desk, of which he had smoked 50 or more a day for the previous 30 years, as well as a box of Cuban cigars.
