Both Montini and the pope had <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> when Montini parted for his diocese, with its 1,000 churches, 2,500 priests and 3,500,000 souls. On 5 January 1955, Montini formally took possession of his Cathedral of Milan.

500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a {{grand piano}} for guests at a listening party for Artpop in Berlin's Berghain nightclub. She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' But I do have a home. I have a home with you always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing but her voice and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E

Coach Gary Kirsten was also carried around the ground later. The Indian players dedicated their victory to Tendulkar; Virat Kohli said, [...] "he has carried {{the burden of}} the nation for 21 years. It is time we carried him on our shoulders." [...] Gautam Gambhir dedicated the victory to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, and to the soldiers guarding India's borders.|$|E

5000|$|Those are {{the ones}} who, given the reality of French laïcité, have no other choice than to cry racism, a <b>tear</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> and a hand on their heart, on the pretext that their [...] "religious feelings" [...] have been mocked by a drawing in Charlie. Among them you will find many who stand for laïcité in France but vote Ennahda in Tunisia, who do their {{shopping}} at a Parisian halal butcher but would cry scandal if an eccentric decided to open a charcuterie in Jeddah.

5000|$|David Callaghan of RenownedForSound {{said that}} [...] "Boyzone are {{one form of}} music group that never seems to age {{and that they have}} a legacy not many other artists or groups {{combined}} could try and reach. Going on, he said that Ronan Keating, arguably their most notable member, starts us off with the cheesy yet powerful ballad Love Will Save the Day, and you can picture every girl, woman and grandmother have a <b>tear</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> and a melted heart <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hands. Everything I Own, Centre of Gravity and Heaven Is, continues the notion of soppy sweetness and screaming women from afar. Of course I can’t take anything away from Boyzone, this is what they’ve built their success on {{and for the most part}} it’s worked, so I congratulate each and every one of them. To take a look at the titles of all eleven tracks on the album, you know before you listen exactly what you’re going to get, if you didn’t know by now. BZ20 is a solid album, Boyzone do sound as good as ever. They don’t appear to of sold out and cashed in on a novelty album, like many other boy bands have done time and again. They stay consistent, sound very strong and coherent musically, and have produced and album that will keep everyone happy." ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 16, 1998, a {{gathering}} of local people and former American and Vietnamese soldiers stood together at {{the place of the}} My Lai massacre in Vietnam to commemorate its 30th anniversary. American veterans Hugh Thompson and Lawrence Colburn, who were shielding civilians during the massacre, addressed the crowd. Among the listeners was Phan Thi Nhanh, a 14-year-old girl {{at the time of the}} massacre. She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, [...] "We don't say we forget. We just try not to think about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that". Colburn challenged Lieutenant Calley, [...] "...to face the women we faced today who asked the questions they asked, and look at the <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and tell them why it happened". No American diplomats nor any other officials attended the meeting.|$|E

When I looked around the room, all across the people were so emotional, <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> They're crying. A great individual, a great Illinoisan." [...] Governor Rod Blagojevich stated, [...] "After the speech last night, I would think {{that even if he}} had an opponent, he might get 100 percent of the vote."

2500|$|The play {{opened on}} 17 January 1904, the director's birthday, at the Moscow Art Theatre under the {{direction}} of the actor-director Konstantin Stanislavski. During rehearsals, the structure of Act Two was re-written. Famously contrary to Chekhov's wishes, Stanislavski's version was, by and large, a tragedy. Chekhov disliked the Stanislavski production intensely, concluding that Stanislavski had [...] "ruined" [...] his play. In one of many letters on the subject, Chekhov would complain, [...] "Anya, I fear, should not have any sort of tearful tone... Not once does my Anya cry, nowhere do I speak of a tearful tone, in the second act there are <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> but the tone is happy, lively. Why did you speak in your telegram about so many tears in my play? Where are they? ... Often you will find the words [...] "through tears," [...] but I am describing only the expression on their faces, not tears. And in the second act there is no graveyard." [...] The playwright's wife Olga Knipper played Madame Ranevskaya in the original Moscow Art Theatre production, as well as in the 300th production of the play by the theatre in 1943.|$|E
60|$|All these occurrences, {{united to}} the {{protracted}} absence of Mark, made Bridget and Anne extremely unhappy. To increase this unhappiness, Doctor Yardley took {{it into his}} head to dispute the legality of a marriage that had been solemnized on board a ship. This was an entirely new legal crotchet, but {{the federal government was}} then young, and jurisdictions had not been determined as clearly as has since been the case. Had it been the fortune of Doctor Yardley to live in these later times, he would not have given himself the trouble to put violent constructions on anything; but, getting a few female friends to go before the necessary judge, with <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye's,</b> anything would be granted to their requests, very much as a matter of course. Failing of this, moreover, there is always the resource of the legislature, which will usually pass a law taking away a man's wife, or his children, and sometimes his estate, if a pretty pathetic appeal can be made to it, in the way of gossip. We have certainly made great progress in this country, within the last twenty years; but whether it has been in a direction towards the summit of human perfection, or one downward towards the destruction of all principles, the next generation will probably be better able to say than this. Even the government is getting to be gossipian.|$|R

2500|$|A {{few years}} later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won {{the title of}} Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown. Williams later commented that {{she was one of}} five {{minority}} contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham [...] "had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [...]" [...] She also pointed out that [...] "Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial.

[...] Williams' reign as Miss America was not without its challenges and controversies, however. For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and hate mail.

25|$|Round 3 – Ptolomaea: {{the third}} region of Cocytus {{is named after}} Ptolemy, who invited his {{father-in-law}} Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while <b>their</b> <b>tears</b> freeze <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies ("before dark Atropos has cut their thread"). Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, Bolgia 5) and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Michel Zanche's soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice ("And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness").|$|R
