5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole.</b> The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>hole</b> to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
