5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> HD has also influenced <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic kidney disease, familial Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E
5|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, Pearson planned {{to come out}} of {{retirement}} in 1989, replacing the injured Neil Bonnett in the Wood Brothers' No. 21 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Following <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> the event, however, he suffered severe neck and back pain, and chose instead to announce his retirement; Tommy Ellis replaced Pearson for the race.|$|E
5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> HIV RNA or DNA, or via <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
30|$|Diagnostic <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> {{these models}} (Tukey <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> non-additivity plus {{lack of fit}} <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> plots of Pearson {{residuals}} and Breusch-Pagan <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> heteroscedasticity) showed that these models fitted the data well.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> {{outliers}} based on externally studentized residuals {{is shown to}} be related to a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> predictive failure. The relationships between a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> outliers, a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> a correlated mean shift and a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> an intercept shift are developed. A sequential <b>testing</b> procedure <b>for</b> outliers and structural change is shown to be independent, so that the overall size of the joint test can be determined exactly. It is established that a joint <b>test</b> <b>for</b> outliers and constancy of variances cannot be performed...|$|R
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to check whether a given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E
5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{isolated}} high LDL and clinical criteria (which differ by country), genetic <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> LDL receptor mutations and ApoB mutations can be performed. Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80% of cases; those without a mutation often have higher triglyceride levels and may in fact have other causes for their high cholesterol, such as combined hyperlipidemia due to metabolic syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Site <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> {{both the}} Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges {{took place during}} late 1959 to early 1960. The {{construction}} of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.|$|E

5|$|When {{brain death}} is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded. <b>Testing</b> <b>for</b> reflexes can be of help in the decision, as can the absence of response and breathing. Clinical observations, including a total lack of responsiveness, a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all {{play a role in}} the decision to pronounce brain death.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1960, {{the first section of}} freeway along M-78 was opened in the Lennon area. The next year, the freeway had been {{extended}} as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon. Also in 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of US27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors; the <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the bodies}} of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Yekaterinburg. They were {{identified}} {{on the basis of}} both skeletal analysis and DNA <b>testing.</b> <b>For</b> example, mitochondrial DNA was used to match maternal relations, and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine was a sister of Alexandra. The bodies of Tsarevich Alexei and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007. Repeated and independent DNA tests confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the Romanov family, and proved that none of the Tsar's four daughters survived the shooting of the Romanov family.|$|E

5|$|Inexpensive {{powdered}} S.luteus fruit {{bodies are}} sometimes {{added to the}} more expensive B.edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice {{that is difficult to}} detect with microscopy because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S.luteus to B.edulis powder.|$|E
5|$|Kimi Räikkönen had {{the fastest}} {{time on the}} first day, {{with a time of}} 1:28.833.
