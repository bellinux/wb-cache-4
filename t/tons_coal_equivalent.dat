40|$|AbstractCities {{account for}} nearly 75 % of the world's energy {{consumption}} and contribute more than 80 % to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission; therefore, they attract initiatives aimed at energy conservation and reduction of emission. Currently, in China, diversified models and policies associated with urban development have been put forward including the sustainable city, eco-city and low-carbon city models, and urban recycling economy. However, the most eco-friendly model is currently not known. This research, taking Beijing as a case study, was conducted to predict the effects of different development alternatives on future energy consumption and carbon emission. A Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model was built to analyze the future trends of energy demand, energy structure and carbon emission from the base year 2007 to 2030 under three scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU), basic-policy (BP) and low-carbon (LC). The results show that in the LC scenario the total energy demand in Beijing {{is expected to reach}} 88. 61 million metric <b>tons</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> (Mtce) by 2030, 55. 82 % and 32. 72 % lower than those of the BAU and BP scenarios, respectively. The total carbon emissions in 2030 with the LC scenario, although higher than the 2007 values, will be 62. 22 % and 36. 75 % lower than the BAU and BP scenarios, respectively. In addition, clean and efficient energy will account for 58 % of the total energy consumption of Beijing under the LC scenario in 2030; this is 17 % and 12 % higher than those of the BAU and BP scenarios, respectively. In terms of the reduction potential of energy consumption and carbon emissions, the industrial sector will continue to account for the largest proportion under the BP and LC scenarios when compared with the BAU scenario. Importantly, the building and transport sectors were identified as promising fields for achieving effective control of energy consumption and carbon emissions in Beijing over the next two decades.

40|$|CO 2 {{emission}} {{resulted from}} fossil energy use is threatening human sustainability globally. This study {{focuses on the}} low-carbon transition of Hebei’s coal-dominated energy system by estimating its total end-use energy consumption, primary energy supply and resultant CO 2 emission up to 2030, by employing an energy demand analysis model based on setting of the economic growth rate, industrial structure, industry/sector energy consumption intensity, energy supply structure, and CO 2 emission factor. It is found that the total primary energy consumption in Hebei will be 471 and 431 million <b>tons</b> of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> (tce) in 2030 in our two defined scenarios (conventional development scenario and coordinated development scenario), which are 1. 40 and 1. 28 times of the level in 2015, respectively. The resultant full-chain CO 2 emission will be 1027 and 916 million tons in 2030 in the two scenarios, which are 1. 24 and 1. 10 times of the level in 2015, respectively. The full-chain CO 2 emission will peak in about 2025. It is found that the coal-dominated situation of energy structure and CO 2 emission increasing trend in Hebei can be changed in the future in the coordinated development scenario, in which Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area coordinated development strategy will be strengthened. The energy structure of Hebei can be optimised since the proportion of coal in total primary energy consumption can fall from around 80 % in 2015 to below 30 % in 2030 and the proportions of transferred electricity, natural gas, nuclear energy and renewable energy can increase rapidly. Some specific additional policy instruments are also suggested to support the low-carbon transition of energy system in Hebei under {{the framework of the}} coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, and with the support from the central government of China...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{emissions}} {{from the road}} transportation industry in China have been increasing rapidly. To evaluate the reduction potential of greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions of the industry in China, its emission inventory was calculated and scenario analysis was created for the period between 2012 and 2030 in this paper. Based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) model, the development of China’s road transportation industry in two scenarios (the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and the comprehensive-mitigation (CM) scenario) was simulated. In the Comprehensive Mitigation scenario, there are nine various measures which include Fuel Economy Standards, Auto Emission Standards, Energy-saving Technology, Tax Policy, Eco-driving, Logistics Informatization, Vehicle Liquidation, Electric Vehicles, and Alternative Fuels. The cumulative energy and emission reductions of these specific measures were evaluated. Our results demonstrate that China’s road transportation produced 881 million metric tons of CO 2 and emitted 1420 thousand tons of CO, 2150 thousand tons of NOx, 148 thousand tons of PM 10, and 745 thousand tons of HC in 2012. The reduction potential is quite large, and road freight transportation is the key mitigation subsector, accounting for 85 %– 92 % of the total emission. For energy conservation and carbon emission mitigation, logistics informatization {{is the most effective}} method, potentially reducing 1. 80 billion <b>tons</b> of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> and 3. 83 billion tons of CO 2 from 2012 to 2030. In terms of air pollutant emission mitigation, the auto emission standards measure performs best with respect to NOx, PM 10, and HC emission mitigation, and logistic informatization measure is the best in CO emission reduction. In order to maximize the mitigation potential of China’s road transportation industry, the government needs to implement various measures in a timely and strict fashion...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of China's energy statistics {{is of great}} concern because it contributes greatly to the uncertainties in estimates of global emissions. This study attempts to improve the understanding of uncertainties in China's energy statistics and evaluate their impacts on China's emissions {{during the period of}} 1990 – 2013. We employed the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) model to calculate China's emissions based on different official data sets of energy statistics using the same emission factors. We found that the apparent uncertainties (maximum discrepancy) in China's energy consumption increased from 2004 to 2012, reaching a maximum of 646  Mtce (million <b>tons</b> of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent)</b> in 2011 and that coal dominated these uncertainties. The discrepancies between the national and provincial energy statistics were reduced after the three economic censuses conducted during this period, and converging uncertainties were found in 2013. The emissions calculated from the provincial energy statistics are generally higher than those calculated from the national energy statistics, and the apparent uncertainty ratio (the ratio of the maximum discrepancy to the mean value) owing to energy uncertainties in 2012 took values of 30. 0, 16. 4, 7. 7, 9. 2 and 15. 6  %, for SO 2, NO x, VOC, PM 2. 5 and CO 2 emissions, respectively. SO 2 emissions are most sensitive to energy uncertainties because of the high contributions from industrial coal combustion. The calculated emission trends are also greatly affected by energy uncertainties – from 1996 to 2012, CO 2 and NO x emissions, respectively, increased by 191 and 197  % according to the provincial energy statistics but by only 145 and 139  % as determined from the original national energy statistics. The energy-induced emission uncertainties for some species such as SO 2 and NO x are comparable to total uncertainties of emissions as estimated by previous studies, indicating variations in energy consumption could be an important source of China's emission uncertainties. </p...|$|R
40|$|India is a {{developing}} country with a growing population and economy. For sustainable growth, it will need to secure its supply of energy minerals. In 2013, India ranked 5 th in terms of coal reserves, 21 st in crude oil reserves, and 23 rd in natural gas. At the same time, India was the 3 rd largest producer of bituminous and lignite, 22 nd largest producer of crude oil, and the 25 th largest producer of natural gas. In addition, India was also the 4 th largest energy consumer in the world. The total primary usage in India is dominated by coal followed by oil and natural gas. In the period from 2000 - 2013, the total annual energy consumption doubled to 595. 0 million <b>tons</b> oil <b>equivalent.</b> <b>Coal</b> increased its share from 49 to 54 % and oil decreased its share from 36 to 30 % of the total.
