5000|$|The Ferguson system, {{as it was}} called, was {{not just}} an {{improved}} hitch but rather the hitch plus an entire line of implements purpose-built to make full use of its advantages. During the 1940s, it was so advantageous and popular that other manufacturers were compelled {{to come up with}} competing hitch improvements that could also be pitched as proprietary [...] "systems" [...] with {{at least some of the}} features of the Ferguson system (such as quick, easy hitching and unhitching, implement raising and lowering controlled from the <b>tractor</b> <b>seat,</b> and treating the tractor and implement as a unit rather than an articulated pair). Thus International Harvester developed its Fast Hitch and began to advertise the notion of [...] "farming with the Farmall system", and a similar path was followed at John Deere. Some of these systems, with two-point hitching, were not well suited to lifting heavy implements. They also presented the problem of incompatibility between brands of tractors and implements, applying pressure toward vendor lock-in that many farmers resented. During the 1950s and 1960s, farmers often would have to purchase the same brand implements as their tractor to be able to hook up the implement correctly or to best effect. If a farmer needed to use a different brand of implement, an adaptation kit—which were typically clumsy, ill-fitting, or unsafe—was sometimes needed. The pressure toward vendor lock-in was a two-edged blade for the salespeople. It was an advantage in cases where it encouraged the sale of implements (e.g., a farmer decided to purchase not just a tractor but also new implements to replace his old ones, betting on increased productivity to make it worth the cost), but it was a disadvantage to the extent that farmers didn't see the value in a special new hitch if they couldn't afford also to buy new implements to make full use of it or felt uneasy about buying new implements when they already had existing implements that were still usable. Ferguson often faced the latter problem in the UK and Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s, and it also applied to the competitors' proprietary hitches of the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
40|$|Farmers {{experience}} whole-body vibrations {{when they}} drive tractors.

40|$|A low {{friction}} <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> with nonlinear stiffness and dead-band damping was investigated both by simulation and experimentation. The {{objective was to}} determine if a practical, soft suspension system could be developed that offered improved vibration performance compared to a typical mechanical commercial <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> suspension. A hard damper was used to prevent end stop impacts that were more likely with the soft suspension. In addition the damper had a dead-band centered at the seat's static equilibrium position. The dead-band damping was achieved with a switchable damper using relative seat displacement as the control signal. The objective of the dead-band was to allow a soft undamped operating region that gave good vibration attenuation. If the relative seat displacement passed the dead-band limits due to sudden harsh inputs, the hard damping would take over and prevent end stop impacts. An experimental rig with nonlinear seat and switchable damping was built and tested with the same parameters and inputs as those used in the simulations. The simulation and experimental results compared well. Both the simulation and experimental results showed that a combination of nonlinear stiffness and dead-band damping used on a <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> gives reduced rms acceleration compared to a linear, conventionally damped seat...|$|E
40|$|Poster {{presented}} at the University of New Mexico Occupational Therapy Research Day, April 20 th, 2016, Albuquerque, NM. Purpose: Agricultural machinery exposes farmers to unique environmental, biological, and physical factors. These conditions place these individuals at {{a higher risk of}} developing musculoskeletal and vibratory disorders. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the seated pressure distribution of participants on four different intervention cushions during dynamic tractor conditions. We predicted that an existing contour <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> will not be as effective in distributing seated pressure of the tractor operator as the four intervention cushions. Methods: Using a quantitative cross-over design, three participants were recruited through an informal convenience sampling method. Participants met the inclusion criteria by being adults, 18 + YOA, having no existing motor or sense loss in lower extremities, and no unhealed decubitus ulcers. Using the clinical protocol for pressure mapping from XSensor®, each participant completed five trials on five different tractor seats: on a <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> without an intervention cushion, and with four intervention cushions. Analysis of the data was conducted using clinical methods and basic descriptive statistics. Results: The XSensor® pressure mapping data collected indicate that in most cases the intervention cushions provided a statistically significant difference in distributing seated pressure compared to the <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> alone. However, in comparison to each other, the distribution in seated pressure of the intervention cushions varied with each participant’s body type. In order to accurately recommend best seat interventions for each participant, repeat trials would need to be completed. Conclusion: Due to the limited number of participants in this study, statistical conclusions cannot be made at this time. There is a need for further research and field testing of seat cushions under dynamic conditions.

40|$|Purpose: Farmers with {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} operate agricultural machinery and attempt to reduce their risk of pressure ulcers with aftermarket seat cushions. Research is limited in testing aftermarket cushions under dynamic conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the seated pressure data of participants under five different types of seat cushions. We predict that seat cushions with greater immersion will result in lower maximum pressures resulting in a lower risk of developing a pressure ulcer. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental design, eight participants were recruited through an informal convenience sampling method. Participants met the inclusion criteria by having paralysis or a spinal cord injury that causes a significant impairment to their motor or sensory functions. An FSA pressure mapping system was used as the instrument to collect pressure data as participants completed five trials of sitting on a <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> while dynamically suspended on a platform constructed to replicate dynamic conditions. Testing trials were repeated on a <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> alone, with a foam cushion, with a low profile air bladder cushion, with a mid-profile air bladder cushion, and with a high profile air bladder cushion. The cushion conditions were randomized. Data was analyzed using SAS software. Results: Based on pressure mapping data collected, results indicate that all the aftermarket cushions provided a statistically significant lower dispersion index compared to the <b>tractor</b> <b>seat</b> alone. In comparison to each other, however, the dispersion indexes of the aftermarket cushions showed no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Due to the limited number of participants in this study, statistical conclusions cannot be made at this time.

40|$|Drivers {{of heavy}} {{vehicles}} often face with higher amplitudes of frequencies range between 1 - 80 Hz. Hence, this {{range of frequency}} results in temporary or even sometimes permanent damages {{to the health of}} drivers. Examples for these problems are damages to the vertebral column and early tiredness, which both reduce the driver’s performance significantly. One solution to this problem is to decrease the imposed vibration to the driver’s seat by developing an active seat system. These systems require an online measuring unit to sense vibrations transferred to the seat.

Four cases involved women who were baling hay. In the fifth case, a 12 year old girl was asked by her father to check the bale counter. All five of the incidents involved inadequately guarded drivelines and victims who were standing or walking near rotating drivelines. The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines.

To break up these compacted soil layers using small tractors a deep working oscillatory ripper was developed at the University of South Australia which had two deep working oscillating tines. One of the most important factors for the performance of this oscillatory ripper is the oscillation angle of the tines. To find the optimum oscillation angle a series of field tests were conducted in a sand-loam soil at six different oscillation angles. The tines oscillated at a frequency of 4. 9 Hz and with amplitudes of between ± 60 and 69 mm, with a nominal forward speed of 3 km/h. The trial results were quantified as draft requirement, power saving, power ratio, loosened area and amount of vibration on <b>tractor</b> <b>seat.</b> The greatest draft reduction of 50 % was achieved for negative oscillation angles, where power ratio was less than 1. Power saving was significantly affected by changing oscillation angle. In general, vibration of the driver seat was higher for negative angles.

An artificial track was constructed to simulate a farm field based on BIS (Bureau of Indian Standard) and to examine vibration the transmissibility of the seats when installed in tractor. The results indicated that the transmissibility from under the seat to on the seat in the vertical direction (Oblique Tempered Spring Q) was approximately 0. 22, although little reduction of vibration was observed in the fore-aft direction. The results of these experiments indicate that significant differences exist between the characteristics of tempered springs and non- tempered springs of seat. This suggests that the oblique seats with tempered springs are applicable to the agricultural field. Considerable effort has been made to establish the optimum design parameters for tractor seats. Further reductions in the level of ride vibrations experienced by tractor seats appear to be necessary and some possible methods of achieving significant improvements have been outlined.

40|$|Apart {{the winter}} period, the {{activity}} in specialized agricultural cultivations (i. e. wine- and fruit-growing) is distributed {{for a long}} period of the year. Some tasks, such as pesticide distribution, are repeated several times during the growing season. On the other hand, mechanization is one of the pillars on which is based the modern agriculture management. As a consequence, in wine growing the tractor driver has to be considered a worker potentially subjected to high level of vibrations, due to the poor machinery conditions often encountered, and sometimes to the rough soil surface of the vineyard combined with the high travelling speed adopted in carrying out many operations. About vibrations, the Italian Decree 81 / 08 basically refers to the European Directive 2002 / 44 /CE, that provides some very strict limits of exposure, both for whole body and hand-arm districts. In Oltrepo pavese, a large hilly area located the south part of the Pavia province (Lombardy - Italy) wine growing is the main agricultural activity; for this reason, a detailed survey on the vibration levels recorded at the <b>tractor</b> driver’s <b>seat</b> was carried out, in order to ascertain the real risk to which the operators are exposed. The activity in wine growing has been classified into 6 groups of similar tasks, as follows: 1. canopy management: pruning, trimming, binding, stripping, etc.; 2. soil management: harrowing, hoeing, subsoiling etc.; 3. inter-row management: chopping of pruning, pinching, grass mowing, etc.; 4. crop protection: pesticides and fungicides distribution, sulfidation, foliar fertilization, etc.; 5. grape harvesting: manual or mechanical; 6. transport: from the vineyard to the cellar. For each group of tasks, the vibration levels on 3 the traditional axes (x, y and z) were recorded, and then an exposure time was calculated for each of them, in order to ascertain the risk level in comparison to what provided by the dedicated standard. Finally, a detailed study was conducted on the most dangerous working conditions, with the goal to offer solutions able to reduce the overall exposure, as improving the comfort level, as to shorten the working time when possible and/or to provide suitable periods of rest...|$|R
40|$|Its {{getting close}} to making silage again and it’s {{a good time to}} remind {{everyone}} about safety during silo filling. Dr. Keith Bolsen, formerly of Kansas State University just published a great silo safety manual. I will try to summarize some of his rec‐ ommendations below and feel free to contact us if you would like a copy. Tractor roll‐over safety items: • Roll over cages create a zone of protection for the <b>tractor</b> operator and <b>seat</b> belts should also be worn. • Never fill higher than a bunker wall to prevent drop off. • Sight rails should be installed to indicate where the wall is to the pack tractor operator. • Use the progressive wedge design when filling bunkers and piles to provide a safe slope. • To reduce the risk of tractor roll‐over, keep the slope a minimum of 3 to 1 on the sides and ends of a drive over pile. • Tractors should be backed up steep slopes to prevent roll backs. • Wide front‐end tractors equipped with well lugged tires prevent slipping. • Never use any type of hay or straw bales as temporary bunker walls. • Add weights to front/back of tractors to improve stability and packing density. • Keep the center of gravity low when moving silage in a bucket • Establish a driving pattern when 2 or more tractors are used to prevent colli‐ sions Proceedings from the 2010 Delmarva Dairy Days can be found at...|$|R
5000|$|The Avro Duigan {{was single}} <b>seat</b> <b>tractor</b> biplane built by A.V. Roe for the pioneer Australian aviator John Robertson Duigan in 1911. Roe's first biplane design, the Avro Type D had first flown in April 1911. The Avro Duigan {{was a major}} {{refinement}} of this fundamentally successful aircraft. It had a square rather than triangular cross section fuselage, simplifying construction and allowing the crew seats to be lower down, giving more protection. The wings were supported using an aerodynamically cleaner ordinary two-bay layout, replacing the {{two and a half}} bay arrangement of its predecessor, which had a third pair of interplane struts close to the fuselage. The undercarriage was simpler, a V-strut below the wing leading edge bearing a leaf-spring axle whose wheels had the refinement of covered spokes, and under this a single long skid supported by a second V-strut below the trailing edge and a single strut from the extreme nose of the aircraft. The tailplane was steel framed, with a rectangular fixed stabiliser and elevator and rudder. Other details were as previous aircraft.The fuselage was constructed of wire-braced ash metal covered forward of the cockpits. The observer sat in front with the pilot sitting behind the cut away trailing edge, an arrangement which positioned the front cockpit close to the centre of gravity of the aircraft and allowed it to be flown without a passenger with no change its balance. The wire-braced high aspect ratio two-bay wings had ash spars and poplar ribs with the curved ends formed from cane. Lateral control was by wing warping. A sprung tailskid was mounted below the rudder and small hoops were fitted below the outer interplane struts to protect the wingtips. The aircraft had dual controls and was fitted with small [...] "Cellon" [...] window to improve downward vision.|$|R
