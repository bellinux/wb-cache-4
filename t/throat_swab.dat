A 69-year-old woman who had history of hypertension was found to have been coughing. <b>Throat</b> <b>swab</b> was conducted after she was transferred to ICU due to suffocation.

25|$|A {{diagnosis}} usually {{can be made}} by the presenting {{signs and}} symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a <b>throat</b> <b>swab</b> or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the performance of the NucliSens easyMAG platform for nucleic acid extraction from different clinical specimens compared to NucliSens miniMAG platform and manual QIAGEN extraction. The NucliSens easyMAG and the NucliSens miniMAG showed equal performance on 215 <b>throat</b> <b>swabs</b> since real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification scored the same samples positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 9) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 5) RNAs, although internal control RNA was slightly better detected with the NucliSens easyMAG (99. 3 % versus 96. 8 %). NucliSens easyMAG extracted nucleic acids more efficiently (higher recovery and/or fewer inhibitors) compared to QIAGEN extraction by showing, on average, lower Ct values in real-time LightCycler PCR, although 4 individual specimen out of 45 were found positive only with QIAGEN. For nine M. pneumoniae-positive <b>throat</b> <b>swabs,</b> the mean difference in Ct values between NucliSens easyMAG extraction and QIAGEN extraction was − 2. 26 (range, − 5. 77 to + 0. 60); for the detection of five C. pneumoniae-positive <b>throat</b> <b>swabs,</b> the average difference in Ct values between the two methods was − 3. 38 (range, − 6. 62 to − 2. 02); and for the detection of cytomegalovirus in 24 blood samples, the mean difference in Ct values between the two methods was − 0. 95 (range, − 5. 51 to + 1. 68).

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} beta haemolytic, Lancefield group C streptococci in <b>throat</b> <b>swabs</b> taken in routine clinical practice, and correlate the species identified with presenting clinical features. METHODS: One year, laboratory based prospective study, using a questionnaire to elicit clinical information. RESULTS: 4. 4 % of <b>throat</b> <b>swabs</b> yielded group C streptococci, of which 38 % belonged to S equisimilis and 53 % to S anginosus-milleri group (SAM). Pyrexia was more common in patients with S equisimilis, but other clinical features {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups. No S zooepidemicus was isolated. CONCLUSIONS: Species identification of group C streptococci from <b>throat</b> <b>swabs</b> {{does not appear to be}} clinically useful in this patient population. However, the prevalence and spectrum of organisms is similar to that reported in N America, where studies suggest a possible role in some cases of severe pharyngitis.

25|$|In up to 25% of patients, no {{focus of}} {{infection}} is found and {{the diagnosis is}} usually made on blood cultures or <b>throat</b> <b>swab.</b> Melioidosis {{is said to be}} able to affect any organ in the body except the heart valves (endocarditis). Although meningitis has been described secondary to ruptured brain abscesses, primary meningitis has not been described.

25|$|Most {{cases are}} caused by a viral infection. Strep throat is the cause in about 25% of {{children}} and 10% of adults. Uncommon causes include other bacteria such as gonorrhea, fungus, irritants such as smoke, allergies, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Specific testing is not recommended in people who have clear symptoms of a viral infection such as a cold. Otherwise a rapid antigen detection test (RAPD) or <b>throat</b> <b>swab</b> is recommended. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include epiglottitis, thyroiditis, retropharyngeal abscess, and occasionally heart disease.|$|E
2500|$|A {{complete}} screen (blood culture, sputum culture, urine culture, <b>throat</b> <b>swab,</b> {{and culture}} of any aspirated pus) should be performed on all patients with suspected melioidosis (culture on blood agar as well as Ashdown's medium).

[...] A <b>throat</b> <b>swab</b> is not sensitive, but is 100% specific if positive, and compares favourably with sputum culture.
