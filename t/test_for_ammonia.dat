The nitrogenous compounds mainly generated by animal excretion can cause deterioration of water quality and produce chronic or even acute toxicity to aquatic animals.

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} measure ammonia emission concentrations from dairies using an isolation flux chamber. A hybrid dairy in Comanche county, Texas, was measured for one week each during August 2002 and January 2003. Sixty total ammonia samples {{were taken from the}} free stall barn, open lot, mixing tank, separated solids, compost, and two lagoons using the developed protocol. The ammonia concentration measurements were made using a chemiluminescence analyzer located inside a mobile laboratory. From the emission concentrations recorded, it was estimated that 9. 68 metric tons of ammonia were produced from this dairy per year. An emission factor of 13. 34 ? 28. 80 kilograms per day per thousand head of cattle (kg/day/ 1000 head) was estimated for this dairy (? 95 % confidence intervals) during summer conditions. For winter conditions the emission factor was 12. 05 ? 12. 89 kg/day/ 1000 head. The 11 % difference of the emission factors from summer to winter conditions was predominantly from the change in ambient and control volume temperatures (a mean difference of approximately 25 degrees Celsius), differences in source temperatures, and seasonal variability in husbandry. The adsorption of ammonia onto different polymer tubing used in pollutant stream conveyance was researched for possible systematic losses. Teflon and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>ammonia</b> losses with treatments of: temperature, length, and inlet concentration.

Analyses of the initial materials showed that besides epoxy, hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, a significant amount of sulfur is incorporated as sulfonic group for GO prepared by the Hummers-Offeman method. The process of ammonia adsorption seems to be strongly related to the type of GO. For GO prepared by the Brodie method, ammonia is mainly retained via intercalation in the interlayer space of GO and by reaction with the carboxylic groups present {{at the edges of the}} graphene layers. On the contrary, when GO prepared by the Hummers method is used, the ways of retention are different: not only is the intercalation of ammonia observed but its reaction with the epoxy, carboxylic and sulfonic groups present is also observed. In particular, during the ammonia adsorption process, sulfonic groups are converted to sulfates in the presence of superoxide anions O 2 -*. These sulfates can then react with ammonia to form ammonium sulfates. For both GOs, an incorporation of a significant part of the ammonia adsorbed as amines in their structure is observed as a result of reactive adsorption. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} of the need of reducing CO 2, NOx and SOx emissions from combustion systems has led to a strong interest in biomass as a fuel source. Using it in combination with fluidised bed combustion technology can lead to a lowering of NOx emissions to the atmosphere. However, this is not a problem-free technique, since the flue gas can contain ammonia, NOx and tar. The fluidised bed can also cease to fluidise if the bed agglomerates. Ammonia can be removed from the flue gas by catalytic methods either by degradation to hydrogen and nitrogen or by selective catalytic oxidation (SCO) to nitrogen and water. Choosing a proper combination of fuel, bed material, NOx repressing additive and an alkali-capturing additive can lower both the NOx emissions and the degree of agglomeration. The optimal combination of fuel, bed material, alkali-capturing additive and NOx-repressing additive for minimising agglomeration in the bed involves use of sawdust, mullite, calcite and ammonia bicarbonate. The optimal combination for minimising NO emission would be use sawdust, bone ash, mullite and urea, whereas the optimal combination for minimising N 2 O involves the choice of straw, bone ash, clay and Na 2 CO 3. Agglomeration can be either of a homogeneous type, involving particles of uniform size less than 2 mm in diameter, or of a heterogeneous type, in which particles are up to 60 mm in diameter. In the case of heterogeneous agglomeration, there is a severe risk of the bed ceasing to fluidise. Catalysts were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>ammonia</b> abatement in biogas and flue gas. An Ni-based catalyst was <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> the degradation of ammonia to hydrogen and nitrogen. Pt/CuO/Al 2 O 3 catalysts containing 20 wt% CuO and 0. 5 - 4 wt% Pt that were prepared were used for the selective catalytic oxidation of ammonia in wet and dry biogas/waste gas and in synthetic biogas containing CO, hydrogen and methane. For a “real” biogas, the Ni-based catalyst was able to provide a 35 - 90 % ammonia removal and 90 - 95 % removal of LHCs at 790 - 880 °C. Activity measurements showed Pt/CuO/Al 2 O 3, to be active and selective for the oxidation of ammonia to form nitrogen. A selectivity of about 90 % for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen was achieved at full conversion. The catalyst showed a higher selectivity to nitrogen when the feed was wet than when it was dry. Pretreatment of the catalyst by SO 2 containing gas provided an improved catalyst with a selectivity of about 97 - 98 % to nitrogen at complete ammonia conversion. Although Pt/CuO/Al 2 O 3 showed good performance for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrogen in the presence of biogas components under wet conditions, performance was less good under dry conditions. However, under both wet and dry conditions the catalyst was not selective <b>for</b> <b>ammonia</b> oxidation but oxidised CO and hydrogen as well. The reaction mechanism for the selective catalytic oxidation of ammonia on Pt/CuO/Al 2 O 3 to yield nitrogen was investigated. The results obtained exclude the possibility of NO being a reaction intermediate in nitrogen formation. Most of the nitrogen is formed by direct oxidation and the combining of two NHx. The data obtained suggest the reaction to take place at the Pt/CuO phase boundary between the NHx species being adsorbed on the CuO and the oxygen at the Pt sites...|$|R

Since year-round pesticide concentration data was limited for many California rivers having significant amounts of agricultural runoff, water was collected weekly from one sampling site along each of four rivers for a one-year period. This study was a cooperative effort between the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). The portion conducted by DPR was an investigation of organophosphate, carbamate, and endosulfan residues in surface waters of four rivers: the Sacramento, Merced, Salinas and Russian Rivers. In addition to pesticide residue quantification by DPR, samples were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> toxicity and <b>ammonia</b> concentration by CDFG on a bimonthly basis. Monitoring began on the Sacramento River in November 1993, followed by the Merced River in June of 1994 and by the Salinas and the Russian River...|$|R

40|$|Microporous {{polypropylene}} {{hollow fibers}} can be {{coated with a}} 1. 9 μm layer of perfluorosulfonic acid polymer (‘Nafion’), to give membranes selective <b>for</b> <b>ammonia.</b> The permeability, {{of the order of}} 104 barrers, is comparable with that obtained previously for thick flat perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, though the permeance is much higher. The selectivity <b>for</b> <b>ammonia</b> over hydrogen can be as high as 500 : 1 at room temperature; it is much higher <b>for</b> <b>ammonia</b> over nitrogen. This selectivity drops as the temperature rises. These composite membranes will be commercially valuable if they can be made to withstand the high pressures characteristic of ammonia synthesi...|$|R
