40|$|The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) uses {{resilient}} modulus values as the load-carrying capacity parameter for all pavement materials. However, the maximum sample diameter in standard {{resilient modulus}} test specifications is only 150 mm (6 inches). With that limitation, large-sized aggregates {{can not be}} tested at their full gradation because if top-size-to-sample diameter ratios exceed 1 : 5, arching effects occur during sample preparation which adversely affect the results. Thus, little work has been performed on the resilient modulus of large <b>top</b> <b>sized</b> aggregates. In this study, 305 mm (12 inch) diameter samples of two different aggregates were tested for resilient modulus. The materials were tested at <b>top</b> <b>sizes</b> of 63 mm (2. 5 inches), 38 mm (1. 5 inches), and 19 mm (0. 75 inches). Results indicate that the tests bec~me less repeatable as <b>top</b> <b>size</b> increases, and that resilient modulus does not increase as <b>top</b> <b>size</b> increases. The second result {{is contrary to the}} conventional belief that load carrying capacity of aggregates increases with increasing <b>top</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of the new}} rosin sizing method with a rosin emulsion, alum and polyvinylamine (PV Am) on the {{properties}} of the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were investigated in terms of basis weight, sizing degree, pH value, brightness and folding endurance of the papers. The MIT folding endurances of the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were much larger than that of the control paper due to the use of PV Am in the sizing. The pH values of papers Nos. 1 to 5 sized at pHs 5 to 8 were in acidic region varying from pH 5. 5 to 5. 8, and the papers lost dramatically their brigthnesses and folding endurances. The pH values of papers Nos. 6 to 10 containing different amounts of CaCO_ 3, varied from pH 7. 9 to 8. 3, and the papers retained their permanence well during the accelerated aging. These results illustrate that although the new sizing method was effective under neutral-alkaline papermaking conditions, the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> were acidic and exhibited poor permanence. The use of CaCO_ 3 in the rosin sizing could make the <b>sized</b> <b>papers</b> alkaline so that the papers showed good permanence...|$|R
