5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E

5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the tidal}} radius, or Hill sphere, is <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{center of the}} {{globular}} cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over {{the stars in the}} cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes, or about 113 pc at the distance of 10.4 kpc.|$|E
5|$|SIM Lite {{measurements}} of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics: fundamental galactic parameters, the Oort Limit, disk mass potential, and {{mass of the}} Galaxy to large radii. The first, fundamental galactic parameters, was aimed at answering key questions about the size, shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way. The team hoped to more accurately determine <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun to the galactic center. The second topic, the Oort Limit, would have attempted to determine {{the mass of the}} galactic disk.|$|E

30|$|The {{recursion}} direction can occasionally become wrong. To {{a correct}} estimation {{it is necessary}} to avoid two possible situations: (a) when the unknown node is closer to the recursion origin than one of the two reference nodes; and (b) when both reference nodes are aligned with the recursion origin. These two scenarios can be detected by comparing <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> possible solutions to the recursion origin with <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reference nodes to the recursion origin.|$|R
5|$|The bicycle {{made for}} Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The {{distance}} from bottom bracket to rear axle was 419mm {{rather than his}} normal 403. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom bracket to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} SDU {{and ground}} station bias was calculated from 17 signals exchanged between the ground {{station and the}} aircraft during a 30-minute period before take-off, when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish the accuracy of their calculations, the bias value was used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to the satellite during {{the time it was}} on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> satellite to the aircraft was also calculated while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly after take-off, showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be calculated for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated value, adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the maximum range of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth.|$|E

5|$|The {{temperature}} of the asteroid belt varies with <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200K (−73°C) at 2.2AU down to 165K (−108°C) at 3.2AU However, due to rotation, the surface {{temperature of}} an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation {{and then to the}} stellar background.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E

5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes {{the time that the}} SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E

5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the response is received. This measure is twice <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes {{the time that the}} SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–2005, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{a pair of}} previously unknown rings, now called the outer ring system, which brought the number of known Uranian rings to 13. These rings were subsequently named the μ and ν rings. The μ ring is the outermost of the pair, and is twice <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet as the bright η ring. The outer rings differ from the inner narrow rings {{in a number of}} respects. They are broad, 17,000and 3,800km wide, respectively, and very faint. Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E
