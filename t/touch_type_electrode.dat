50|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> (also called <b>touch</b> <b>type</b> or <b>touch</b> keyboarding) is <b>typing</b> {{without using}} {{the sense of}} sight to find the keys. Specifically, a touch typist will know their {{location}} on the keyboard through muscle memory. <b>Touch</b> <b>typing</b> typically involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along {{the middle of the}} keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for other keys. Both two-handed <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> and one-handed <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> are possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{typing speed}} can be {{increased}} gradually and speeds of 60 WPM or higher can be achieved. The rate of speed increase varies between individuals. Many websites and software products are available to learn <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> {{and many of these}} are free. Learning <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> can be stressful both to the fingers as well as the mind in the beginning, but once it is learned to a decent level, it exerts minimal stress on the fingers. For individuals with past typing experience, learning to <b>touch</b> <b>type</b> is particularly difficult due to motivational reasons: the initial performance level in <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> is far lower than in visually guided typing; therefore it does not initially seem worthwhile to study <b>touch</b> <b>typing.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>Typing</b> Tutor is a {{software}} programme {{which was designed}} to assist teaching <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> skills to visually impaired children. It was first designed and written in the 1990 s by Graeme Douglas and Alan Gamble and then updated in 2000 and is now available as freeware. The programme was specially designed {{to meet the needs of}} visually impaired people (in particular children and young people). For example, it provides the means to set up different colours, dimensions and fonts for the exercise text displayed, and has speech capability. These features make it possible for <b>Touch</b> <b>Typing</b> Tutor to be operated independently by the learner. This program is easy to use, with a full set of <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> exercises supplied. Additional exercises can easily be created using any text editor which is capable of writing plain ASCII files (e. g. the Windows 'Notepad'), and organised into lessons. This means that you are able to use <b>Touch</b> <b>Typing</b> Tutor to teach according to the scheme of your choice - no particular approach is built into the program itself - even replacing the entire suite of lessons with your own if you wish. The software has been used extensively in the UK as well as other parts of the world (particularly Africa) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} haptic, {{auditory}} and visual keyclick feedback on <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> performance using a zero-travel keyboard. We examine how local and global haptic keyclick feedback affect typing performance, and compare them with auditory keyclick feedback and visual feedback conditions. Our aim is to understand how sensory feedback during <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> might improve user performance. Participants are asked to type required text shown {{on a computer screen}} and typing speed and error rates are recorded. The results show that the local haptic keyclick feedback condition leads to the highest typing speed with the lowest total error rate among all feedback conditions. We also find that the intensity of haptic feedback affects typing performance while the intensity of auditory feedback does not. Our findings provide useful design guidelines for improving <b>touch</b> <b>typing</b> performance on a zero-travel keyboard with sensory keyclick feedback information...|$|R

In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the buffer of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in <b>touch</b> <b>typing.</b> Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when {{time is of the}} essence.|$|R
