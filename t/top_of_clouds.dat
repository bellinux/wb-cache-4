40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{estimating}} and visualizing 3 D atmospheric motion using <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> pressure image sequences. The reconstruction of 3 D fluid motion from a monocular sequence of image observations is a very challenging problem for which no solution exists in the literature. Based on a physically sound vertical decomposition of the atmosphere into layers of different pressure interval, we propose here a dense motion estimator dedicated to the extraction of three-dimensional wind fields characterizing the dynamics of a layered atmosphere. Wind estimation is performed using a multi-layer model describing a stack of dynamic horizontal layers, interacting at their boundaries via vertical winds. Furthermore, a 3 D graphical interface is proposed to visualize the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement of each layer. The wind fields are displayed in a physical 3 D coordinate system. This system is deduced from pixel coordinates and altitudes estimated from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> temperature images. Smooth surfaces defining layer vertical boundaries are reconstructed through an altitude extrapolation scheme. An evaluation of the system is performed with Météosat image sequences <b>of</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> pressure. ...|$|R
40|$|Based on former investigations, {{a method}} for remote sensing <b>of</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> {{altitude}} is further developed and in part newly developed. For this purpose, the solar radiation backscattered {{within the range of}} the oxygen A absorption band at #lambda# = 0. 42 nm is measured from a high-altitude aircraft. A statistical analysis of the registered spectra supplies three independent cloud properties determining the backscatter within the O_ 2 A band. This is also found for optically thick clouds above the sea for simulations of radiation transport. By inversion of a model of radiation transmission (matrix-operator method), the optical thickness <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> #delta#_c, the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> z_t_o_p and the geometrical thickness <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> #DELTA#z are remotely sensed.

The kanzashi item does not appear in the original Family Computer version (Otami will go away if Kantaro has 4 coins), but in other installments, it prevents Otami from following Kantaro around. The O-fuda (Japanese amulet) item will protect Kantaro from the ghost character, and the katana will do the same against the thief.

50|$|To {{quantify}} Earth's {{heat budget}} or heat balance, let the insolation received {{at the top}} of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units=about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the albedo of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.|$|E
40|$|Effects on the F {{region of}} two active {{meteorological}} systems will be analyzed. These systems {{are known as}} Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs). Ionospheric data from a vertical sounder located in Tucumán will be used. By comparing the behaviour of the F region parameters on the days {{before and after the}} MCC storm day, we see outstanding differences. These differences occur during night and dawn hours in both cases. The two phenomena show influences on the F region. One case shows an increase in electronic concentration followed by a decrease and the other shows the opposite effect. Gravity wave propagation from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> could be connected to these MCCs effects. Other possible physical mechanisms are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|During a {{planetary}} transit, atoms with high atomic number absorb short-wavelength radiation {{in the upper}} atmosphere, and the planet should appear larger during a primary transit observed in high-energy bands than in the optical band. Here we measure the radius of Venus with subpixel accuracy during the transit in 2012 observed in the optical, ultraviolet and soft X-rays with Hinode and Solar Dynamics Observatory missions. We find that, while Venus’s optical radius is about 80 km larger than the solid body radius (the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and haze), the radius increases further by 470 km in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays. This measures the altitude of the densest ion layers of Venus’s ionosphere (CO 2 and CO), useful for planning missions in situ, and a benchmark case for detecting transits of exoplanets in high-energy bands with future missions, such as the ESA Athena...|$|E
40|$|Reynolds and Smith (1979) have {{considered}} the combined use of digital weather radar and satellite data in interactive systems for case study analysis and forecasting. Satellites view the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> whereas radar is capable of observing the detailed internal structure of clouds. The considered approach {{requires the use of}} a common coordinate system. In the present investigation, it was decided to use the satellite coordinate system as the base system {{in order to maintain the}} fullest resolution of the satellite data. The investigation is concerned with the development of a general interactive software system called RADPAK for remapping and analyzing conventional and Doppler radar data. RADPAK is implemented as a part of a minicomputer-based image processing system, called Atmospheric and Oceanographic Image Processing System. Attention is given to a general description of the RADPAK system, remapping methodology, and an example of satellite remapping...|$|E
40|$|Computational grids {{have been}} at the {{forefront}} of e-science supercomputing for several years now. Many issues have been settled over the years, but some may only appear to be so. One of these issues is firewall traversal. Many solutions have been proposed and developed. We have developed two such solutions ourselves: Remus and Romulus, but like all other solutions, they are limited in application. Others are working on proposed standards or solutions based on existing Internet standards and RFCs. However, we still have production-level grids that instead operate their grid resources on an open firewall policy. Some propose moving grids on top of peer-to-peer networks and/or overlay networks, or rebuilding grids on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> instead. Existing grid infrastructures have not rushed to follow either path, however, as the required changes will take considerable effort and cost for currently running systems. This paper investigates the problem and offers a different proposal: a minor revision to the grid architecture. In order to support what we propose, we will look at several proposed solutions and identify their limitations. We also classify them into two distinct approaches, and discuss how each one is not by itself sufficient for all situations. Then we shall show that a slight improvement to the grid protocol architecture provides a multi-pronged architectural solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterization}} <b>of</b> shallow cumulus <b>clouds</b> {{for use in}} atmospheric {{general circulation}} models is proposed. The parameterization uses a bulk representation of an ensemble <b>of</b> transient <b>clouds.</b> Entrainment <b>of</b> environmental air occurs at the ascending <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cumulus <b>cloud</b> and also at the lateral boundaries of the region below the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cloud.</b> Complete detrainment <b>of</b> {{the air in the}} cloud occurs when the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> reaches its maximum height, chosen to be the level of neutral buoyancy. The parameterization is calibrated using results from the undisturbed period of the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX). Vertical profiles of in-cloud properties and mass fluxes obtained from large eddy simulations (LES) for the undisturbed BOMEX period are successfully reproduced by the parameterization. Good agreement is also found in comparisons with large-scale heat and moisture budgets diagnosed from observations during the same period of the experiment. However, this is achieved with a different choice for the parameters of the scheme. 1...|$|R

40|$|With {{the number}} of {{services}} using virtualization and clouds grow-ing faster and faster, {{it is common to}} mutualize thousands of virtual machines within one distributed system. Consequently, the virtualized services, softwares, hardwares and infrastructures share the same phys-ical resources, thus the performance of one depends of the resources usage of others. Furthermore, each user and his vms have different ob-jectives in term of quality of trust and protection. Thus, the placement and reconfiguration processes need to take them into account. Finally, a new trend is to use clouds to build hpc systems but the deployment of such architecture is not straightforward. We propose a solution for vm placement and reconfiguration based on the observation of the resources quota and the dynamic usage that leads to better balancing of resources. Moreover, our solution also takes into account user’s objectives that express Quality of Trust and Protection and ease the deployment of hpc architectures on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> Furthermore, as {{it is not possible to}} have a single scheduler for the whole cloud and to avoid a single point of failure, our scheduler uses distributed and collaborative scheduling agents. Finally, we present a scenario simulating a geographical distributed clouds and multiple vm usage. This article is an extended version of [22]. It includes larger scale evaluations and the scheduler supports user’s objectives in addition of the resource-centric algorithms. 2...|$|E
40|$|A {{parameterization}} for {{the scattering}} of thermal infrared (longwave) radiation by clouds {{has been developed}} based on discrete-ordinate multiple-scattering calculations. The effect of backscattering is folded into the emission of an atmospheric layer and the absorption between levels by scaling the cloud optical thickness. The scaling {{is a function of}} the single-scattering albedo and asymmetry factor. For wide ranges of cloud particle size, optical thickness, height, and atmospheric conditions, flux errors induced by the parameterization are small. They are � 4 Wm� 2 (2 %) in the upward flux at the top of the atmosphere and � 2 Wm� 2 (1 %) in the downward flux at the surface. Compared to the case that scattering by clouds is neglected, the flux errors are more than a factor of 2 smaller. The maximum error in cooling rate is � 8 %, which occurs at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> as well as at the base of high clouds where the difference between the cloud and surface temperatures is large. With the scaling approximation, radiative transfer equations for a cloudy atmosphere are identical with those for a clear atmosphere, and the difficulties in applying a multiple-scattering algorithm to a partly cloudy atmosphere (assuming homogeneous clouds) are avoided. The computational efficiency is practically the same as that for a clear atmosphere. The parameterization represents a significant reduction in one source of the errors involved in the calculation of longwave cooling in cloudy atmospheres. 1...|$|E
