In this paper, we interpret a temporal logic over a partial order model that is a <b>trace</b> <b>system.</b> The satisfaction of the formulae is directly defined on traces {{on the basis of}} rewriting rules; so, the graph representation of the system can be completely avoided; moreover, a method is presented that keeps the <b>trace</b> <b>system</b> finite, also in the presence of infinite computations.

The concept was tested for around 2 months with 2 <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> from different service providers, with volunteering transport companies using these systems and with the participation of competent authorities in 3 Member States with a substantial share in the international animal transport.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is in supply chain management as it promises to provide real-time visibility based on the function of track and trace. However, such an RFID-based track and <b>trace</b> <b>system</b> raises new security and privacy challenges due to the restricted resource of tags. In this paper, we refine three privacy related models (i. e., the privacy, path unlinkability, and tag unlinkability) of RFID-based track and <b>trace</b> <b>systems,</b> and clarify the relations among these privacy models. Specifically, we have proven that privacy is equivalent to path unlinkability and tag unlinkability implies privacy. Our results simplify the privacy concept and protocol design for RFID-based track and <b>trace</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, we propose an efficient track and trace scheme, Tracker+, which allows for authentic and private identification of RFID-tagged objects in supply chains. In the Tracker+, no computational ability is required for tags, {{but only a few}} bytes of storage (such as EPC Class 1 Gen 2 tags) are needed to store the tag state. Indeed, Tracker+ reduces the memory requirements for each tag by one group element compared to the Tracker presented in other literature. Moreover, Tracker+ provides privacy against supply chain inside attacks...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we develop an automata {{framework}} for partial order structures with branching, {{for which we}} use <b>trace</b> <b>systems.</b> The aim is to investigate the prospects of decidable partial order logics of branching time, derivable from an automata framework. On the one hand we define automata for <b>trace</b> <b>systems</b> directly, which combine asynchronous automata for linear time with tree automata. On the other hand we develop a branching generalisation of Mazurkiewicz trace theory, which links branching concurrent behaviour with tree automata directly: {{the idea is to}} generalise interleaving sequences for partially ordered runs to interleaving trees for <b>trace</b> <b>systems.</b> This development can also be used for partial order reduction methods in model checking for branching time. The latter approach also exposes a problem for the specification of branching time and concurrent behaviour: the distinction between nondeterministic choice and parallelism cannot be maintained completely in the presence of confusion, a notion known from Petri net theory. We discuss several possible ways of coping with this problem. Also on the automata side there are a few surprises. In particular the emptiness problem is decidable as desired, but turns out to be co-NP-complete. (orig.)
