Sea ice is detectable {{in all of}} the ERTS- 1 MSS bands and can be distinguished from clouds through a number of interpretive keys. Considerable information on ice type can be derived from the ERTS- 1 data. Ice types that appear to be identifiable include: ice floes of various categories, pack ice of various concentrations, ice belts, brash ice, rotten ice, fast ice, leads, fractures, cracks, puddles, <b>thaw</b> <b>holes,</b> and flooded ice. Although larger icebergs can be seen, it is difficult to distinguish them from ice floes. Ice features as small as the small floe of 20 to 100 m across can be detected, and the sizes of features somewhat smaller than 100 m can be measured from enlarged ERTS- 1 prints. The multispectral analysis of the ERTS- 1 MSS- 7 bands provides much information on ice type and ice surface features that cannot be derived from a single spectral band. For example, <b>thaw</b> <b>holes</b> can often be distinguished from puddles because of their different appearances in the two bands. These surface features can be indicative of ice age. Furthermore, snow lines on glaciers can be reliably mapped through the joint use of the MSS- 4 and 7 data...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Generally good agreement {{has been observed}} between the location of ice edges and ice concentrations as indicated on aerial observation charts and as mapped from ERTS- 1 imagery. Moreover, ice surface features reported to be ridges and <b>thaw</b> <b>holes</b> are readily detected in the ERTS- 1 imagery. Reported hummocks, puddles, frozen puddles, and rafted ice are not as readily detected in the imagery, although brightness variations on some ice surfaces can be distinguished, thereby suggesting their presence. In the ERTS- 1 imagery, although dark new ice and nilas are difficult to detect, other younger forms of ice can be mapped and can usually be distinguished from older ice because of their lower, more uniform reflectance. A preliminary examination of the initial sample of ERTS- 1 imagery collected during the spring, during the season of maximum ice extend, indicates several ice features of interest. Compact pack ice can be distinguished from coastal fast ice, and many leads can be mapped, even in the mid-Beaufort Sea. Several leads have distinct variation in reflectance...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as rotten ice, lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and dark nilas, fast ice, icefoot, ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, <b>thaw</b> <b>holes,</b> rotten ice, ice islands, dried ice puddles, hummocked ice, and leads...|$|E

40|$|Sea {{ice melt}} {{processes}} during the Arctic summer affect the sea-air-interactions dramatically. The determination of puddles and quantification their morphology, size distribution and life cycle provides important {{information to the}} study of physical processes of sea ice, heat budget, total ice concentration etc. During the summer cruise of ARK IX/ 2 and 3 of the RV "POLARSTERN" in June and July 1993, a helicopter survey of sea ice for different times and locations was carried out using a Line Scan Camera (LSC) with a reselution of 2 m^ 2. An area between 78 °N- 82 °N and 2 °E- 14 °W was covered. Indication of the appearance of free water within the snow pack is usually observed in the surface layers first. This occurred on day 146 (26 May) ranging in the amount of free water present between 0. 5 and 2. 5 %. The first melt puddles on first year ice (FY) were visually observed on June 13 day 164. The subsequent indication of the general onset of melt occurred on 17 June (Julian day 168) in the polynya region as observed on the SSM/I ice charts. This continues for about a week (Julian day 175) until the free water has increased to 6 - 10 % within the surface layer. This period of significant free water production through melt processes coincides with a sharp increase in the melt puddles coverage, based on visual observations from the helicopter, going from 3 % (Julian day 164) to 10 - 80 % melt water on FY ice (Julian day 185 - 190) and 30 - 40 % melt puddles on old ice for the same period. About 10 - 15 days after the brightness temperature reaches nearly black body behaviour, the maximum melt puddles coverage is reached. The refreezing period started at the end of July. The minimum of puddles concentration was detected between 80 °N and 81 °N. No other geographical correlation was found. Size of the puddles was between 2 m 2 to more than 1 km 2 and the depth was between a few centimeters to full thickness of the ice floe (<b>thaw</b> <b>hole).</b> The maximum frequency of the puddles size distribution was by a 1000 m 2 category at the beginning, then shifted to 1 km 2 in the middle, and finally to 100 m 2 {{at the end of the}} campaign. The average depth of the snow at the beginning of ARK IX/ 2 varied significantly over old ice (OI) as compared to first-year ice. The mean depth during the first 10 days (Julian day 144 - 154) was 38. 1 - 21. 8 cm over OI and 14. 6 - 8. 1 cm over FY ice. The maximum-minimum range over OI varied between 62 - 8 cm and 26 - 6 cm for FY ice. By Julian day 180 the snow over FY ice had disappeared, while the snow over old ice reached that state around day 188. The comparison between SSMI and LSC ice date shows, that SSMI derived total ice concentration was higher than that from LSC but lower than the sum of both fractional concentrations of puddles and ice derived from LSC. This is what should be expected and means, that the SSMI derived ice concentrations should be corrected due to the melt features. Using the LSC provides useful ice data on small scale (resolution about 2 m 2), which could be used for better understanding the physical processes of the sea ice...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The {{results of the}} analysis of data collected during {{the spring and summer}} demonstrate that ERTS- 1 imagery has a high potential for monitoring arctic sea ice conditions during the time for maximum ice extent through ice-breakup season. In the eastern Beaufort Sea area, the combination of ERTS- 1 orbital overlap and a high incidence of cloud-free conditions during the spring assures a high frequency of repetitive satellite coverage. In the mid-Beaufort Sea, numerous fractures and leads can be identified, even in the early spring data. Ice features that can be identified include: development of fractures leading to the formation of distinct ice floes; growth and deterioration of leads; evidence of shearing movements of ice masses; formation of new grey ice within leads; distinction between grey, grey-white, and older forms of ice; and the deterioration of the ice surface evidenced by the formation of puddles, <b>thaw</b> <b>holes,</b> and drainage patterns. Ice conditions in the Bering Sea near St. Lawrence Island reported by aircraft observers participating in the Bering Sea Expedition are in close agreement with the ice conditions mapped from the corresponding ERTS- 1 imagery. Ice features identified were: boundaries between grey ice and first year ice, shear leads, and occurrence of open water...|$|E
40|$|About this release This release {{features}} a large collection of classes representing polar and cryosphere-related environments and environmental processes, primarily prepared by @kaiiam. These semantics are in aid of efforts {{such as the}} Alfred Wegener Institute's Frontiers in Arctic Marine Monitoring programme. Knowledge was harvested from numerous resources - such as the review by Boetius et al. (2015, Nat Rev Microbiol 13 : 677 – 690) - which are cross referenced in each class. Efforts to align with existing resources have been initiated, e. g. : [URL] Past and ongoing work related to this project is organised in project cryophile. This work has also motivated the general development of the environmental process hierarchy. A number of other requests, such as that for fissures (see # 466) are also bundled in this release. As usual, the hyperlinks to the terms will be live once OntoBee runs its import cycle over the weekend; however, the PURLs are valid immediately. To better axiomatise the new classes and enhance existing ones, we have also imported numerous classes from other OBO projects, detailed below.

40|$| {{encountered}} a landscape generally {{similar to the}} present one, which {{is evidenced by the}} fact that the youngest till pads the valley depressions, and on the interfluves it often lies on the land surface. The ice-sheet spread over the study area as a thin cover and soon became stagnant and then completely dead. Four main stages of deglaciation have been distinguished: 1. 	ice-sheet dying, 2. 	perforation deglaciation (Pilica-Rawka watershed, along which perforation kames developed), 3. 	formation of moraine interfluves (dead ice cover waning run then separately on the Tomaszów Plain - water flow southward, towards Pilica depression - and on the interfluves around the Upper Rawka depression), 4. 	formation of kame relief in the sub-ice depressions (mainly in the Upper Rawka Basin). The first, not numerous yet kames originated during the second deglaciation stage on the Rawka-Pilica watershed - where there was the thinnest ice-sheet and the most elevated ice-sheet floor. It was observed that those hills are built mainly of meltwater deposits, mostly paraglaciolimnic sands, which indicates that they are not front moraines, as it has been believed so far. During the third stage larger and larger areas of sub-ice elevations were uncovered from underneath the ice. The Rawka-Pilica watershed was at that time the watershed of ablation waters, flowing down South, towards Pilica depression on one side, and on the other flowing down North, towards the Upper Rawka Basin. It is confirmed by the measurements of diagonal stratification in glaciofluvial deposits. Dead ice remained for the longest time in the Upper Rawka Basin, where in the glacial lakes, between ice patches, various kames originated: multi-level terraces, plateaus, hills and ridges. It was the last, fourth stage of deglaciation. All forms that originated here are so to speak ”hidden” in the basin. It is significant that in the study area the relief of the immediate ice-sheet bedrock played fundamental role during all areal deglaciation stages. It controlled the location and the order of origination of <b>thawing</b> <b>holes,</b> the flow directions of ablation waters and the distribution of individual forms of glaciogenic relief (of kames). Three phases were distinguished in the development of kames in the study area: the limnic phase, the glaciofluvial phase, and the ablation phase. The phases correspond to, respectively (beginning from the floor) : the glaciolimnic and paraglaciolimnic sediments, sands and gravels, and - in the peripheral area of kames - diamictone (ablation) covers with zones of gravitational disturbances (falls, landslides, subsidences). The phases were distinguished on the basis of recurring elements of the structure of kames. Meltwater sediments of the limnic stage, beginning from the floor, sometimes start with silts, typically glaciolimnic. Nevertheless, prevailing parts of them are of paraglaciolimnic origin. In most cases they are very fine-grained sands, sedimented in vast basins, under conditions of slow flow. As for this fraction they are well sorted. It is true that according to Folk-Ward indicators, it is most often medium sorting, but we have to bear in mind that these authors’ classification is too ”harsh” for glaciogenic sediments. Standard deviation ( 1) close to 0, 6 - typical of these sediments - is very difficult to find in samples from different facies of Wartian sediments in the study area. During this phase the sediments were deposited, which form the essential part of the levels of accumulation terraces (kame terraces) and of accumulation-erosion terraces, ”stuck” to the slopes of the basin at different heights. Most of the morphologically diverse kame hills and ridges in the Upper Rawka Basin are also built of these sediments. Glaciofluvial phase started at the time, when water basins, due to the advancing disintegration of dead ice, began to diminish - they began to be even more flowable. During this phase paraglaciolimnic accumulation began to be replaced with accumulation of ablation waters of high-energy flow in the braided channels. At first, these waters cut the erosion-susceptible, formerly accumulated fine-grained sands, creating secondary erosional flattenings, vast ”gravel furrows” etc. in them. The sediments accumulated during this phase consist of series of various-grained diagonally stratified sands, and imbricated gravels. It is worth noticing that the flows and the accumulation and erosional activity of meltwaters during this phase of kame accumulation proceeded in temperatures near 0 ° C, which caused thermo-erosional processes to occur. These processes are documented with lumps of paraglaciolimnic sands. Often they are buried in glaciofluvial deposits and still preserve their original layering. In places of coarser material accumulation (e. g. gravel cones at the walls of dead ice), meltwaters operation was selective, leaving the coarse material in convex forms. So it was then - in the deglaciation conditions - when the first accommodation of relief to lithology took place, continued constantly in post-Wartian conditions, and also in the present conditions (concave forms come into being in fine sands and silts, whereas convex forms in coarse, gravelly material). The ablation stage may be characterised as the phase of forming of the peripheral parts of kames in the conditions, when the forms gradually raised above the surrounding dead ice. During this phase intensive mass movements, mainly falls and landslides, took place on kame slopes. They were accompanied by the development of faults and gravitational cracks. Simultaneously, lithologically diverse ablation material flowed and slid down from the ice walls and even from the considerably flattened ice-mineral surfaces. They interbedded gravitational structures and partially coated them. Further melting of dead ice blocks outside the kame hills - in the interkame (thawed) depressions, is recorded in numerous examples of strongly diverse lithologically ablation or intermediate between ablation and glaciofluvial material. Some dead ice blocks after the kame creation stage were still vast, which is indicated by the size of the melt depression of over 1 km in diameter. Formation of water flow systems between kames during the ablation stage, was the event that initiated the development of the post-Wartian river network. One can assume that as long as there were still dead ice blocks, releasing high amounts of water, buried in depressions, and the erosion bases were being lowered as a result of deglaciation, there were favourable conditions for river erosion, continued later in the interglacial conditions of the Eemian period. POST-WARTIAN TRANSFORMATIONS OF GLACIAL RELIEF It is a well known fact that the relief of the Łódź region is characterised by a considerable diversity in the degree of post-Wartian transformations. On the one hand, examples of forms or whole complexes of them, which have their glacial features well preserved are enumerated, and on the other, symptoms of intensive activity of destructive post-Wartian processes, visible particularly in the peripheral zone of the Łódź Upland, are exhibited. The author has observed a great diversity of post-Wartian relief transformations, in both the spatial and the chronological aspect, also in the area between Rawka and Pilica. It has been observed that the effects of post-Wartian erosional-denudational processes on the interfluves are inconspicuous. A little stronger relief transformations took place in the valley areas. In spite of this, the major part of kames preserved their morphological and structural distinctness also here. It is proved, among others, by the presence of ice-contact sediments and structures in edge parts of most of the forms. The facts are another confirmation for the thesis about the relative freshness of Wartian glacial relief, particularly in the interfluves in the Łódź region (Krzemiński 1974). Contemporary denudation processes, particularly the rill wash, especially active since the deforestation, cause road cuttings and ravines to develop in areas of diverse relief. Coarse-grained material is much more resistant to the denudation than fine-grained one and this is why mounds are usually built of gravels and pebbles, whereas depressions develop in fine-grained sands, silts, clays, muds, etc. (paraglaciolimnic sediments) ...|$|R
