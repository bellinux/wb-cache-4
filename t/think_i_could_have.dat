500|$|In {{interviews}} {{after the}} race, Kanaan credited his team's fuel strategy {{for being the}} main factor in his victory. During many of the laps that Wheldon led, Kanaan drafted behind him to use less gasoline than normal, {{and he was able}} to stay on the track longer than other drivers as a result. He said of the strategy, [...] "that's what probably gave me the win." [...] On the other hand, Wheldon later said that his radio problem forced more [...] "conservative" [...] pit stop planning by himself and his team. Third-place finisher Franchitti said: [...] "We had to take the gamble to try to get the win. I thought we had as good a car as TK (Tony Kanaan) and Dan (Wheldon). I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> hung with them, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> caught up with them." [...] Matsuura admitted his first-lap accident was his fault and apologized to his Japanese fans. After his accident on the 135th lap, Andretti was taken to the track's infield care center for a precautionary X-ray scan of his right shoulder which showed a negative result. He said that he struggled with controlling his car but was happy. With his second-place finish, Wheldon gained the season points lead with 188, three ahead of Kanaan and 17 in front of Dixon. The standings were closely contested, with the top six drivers separated by 27 points.|$|E
500|$|According to {{journalist}} Barry Miles, after Lennon and Ono {{had been}} injured {{in a car accident}} in June 1969, partway through recording Abbey Road, a bed was installed in the studio with a microphone so the latter could make artistic comments about the album. Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during {{the latter part of the}} Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. George Harrison verbally assaulted her after she took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking. The English press dubbed her [...] "the woman who broke up the Beatles", but Ono has stated that the Beatles broke up themselves without any direct involvement from her, adding [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> tried even to break them up." [...] In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up The Beatles and even Harrison said in an interview with Cavett that the Beatles had problems long before Ono came on the scene.|$|E
500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was Clemens who cast Diana Rigg {{to replace}} departing star Honor Blackman in The Avengers. He was later quoted as saying, [...] "I didn't do Diana {{a very good}} service. It made her an {{international}} star but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done more for her {{as far as the}} script was concerned. She was rather a stooge to Patrick Macnee's Steed." [...] He did not choose Linda Thorson to replace Rigg.|$|E

2500|$|About the goal, Maradona said, [...] "I {{made the}} play {{to give it}} to Valdano, but when I got to the area they {{surrounded}} me and I had no space. Therefore, I had to continue the play and finish it myself." [...] He later complimented the fair play of the English team, saying, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done it against any other team because they all used to knock you down; they are probably the noblest in the world".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Sacramento Bee, actress Mimi Rogers explained how her identity as a Scientologist helped her with the character Sharon in the 1991 psychological/religious drama film The Rapture. [...] "I don't, for example, have a Jesus Christ definition of God ... And I have no views on heaven or hell. To me they're alien concepts. If I were a practicing Christian or a Jew, with all the hang-ups of those religions, I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done Sharon justice" [...] said Rogers.|$|E
2500|$|... {{played in}} my life. [...] "But {{on the other}} aspect – my {{position}} in the Australian side – it seems, [...] the players that the Australians picked for the establishment, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> made it and probably could have finished up financially about the same – for playing less cricket. But I don't {{think it would have}} done my game any good because I know that playing World Series Cricket – it was tough – I think it made me a lot better cricketer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But really,' pursued Mrs Blimber, 'I <b>think</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> known Cicero, {{and been}} his friend, {{and talked with}} him in his {{retirement}} at Tusculum (beau-ti-ful Tusculum!), <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> died contented.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't much reely," [...] said Kipps; [...] "and you're {{taking a}} lot of trouble. I'm sorry I broke that window. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Stirling, {{with an air}} of {{whimsical}} reflection; [...] "in this case, anyway, <b>I</b> 'most <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> They've <b>had</b> about {{enough of}} the Grenfell Consols. I guess they found them prickly." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 14 August 2005 at the World Championships held in Helsinki she won Britain's only {{gold medal}} {{when she took}} the {{marathon}} title, dominating the race and setting a championship record time of 2:20:57. Catherine Ndereba of Kenya finished in second place, {{more than a minute}} behind. Radcliffe said: [...] "It pretty much went according to plan. If somebody had been with me at the end I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> pushed it up a bit more." [...] She and three other British runners were also awarded third place in the team competition.|$|E
2500|$|Flutie gained {{national}} attention in 1984 {{when he led}} the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against the Miami Hurricanes (led by QB Bernie Kosar). The game was nationally televised on CBS the day after Thanksgiving and thus had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45–41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at its own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only 6 seconds remained. On the last play of the game, Flutie scrambled away from the defense and threw a [...] "Hail Mary pass" [...] that {{was caught in the}} end zone by Gerard Phelan, giving BC a 47–45 win. Flutie won the Heisman trophy a week later, but the voting had finished before the game; Flutie said, however, that [...] "without the Hail Mary pass I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been very easily forgotten".|$|E
2500|$|The infamous {{exchange}} between McCartney and Harrison occurred on Monday, January 6. Around lunchtime on Friday, January 10, tensions {{came to a}} head and Harrison told the others that he was leaving the band. [...] This entire episode is omitted from the film. He later recalled: [...] "I thought, 'I'm quite capable of being happy on my own, and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation I'm getting out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'." [...] Rehearsals and filming continued for a few more sessions; the finished film only used a small amount of footage from this period, namely a boogie-woogie piano duet by McCartney and Starr, although it was included in a way such that Harrison's absence was not apparent. [...] While he was gone, the others considered replacing him with guitarist Eric Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to Lennon, who was captured on tape saying that if: [...] "George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play”, and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that the Beatles, unlike Clapton's previous band Cream, “would give him full scope to play his guitar.” [...] Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: “There may have been [...] The problem with that was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that could be like a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, as if I was the fastest gun. So, I don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George’s.” ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> had my last melancholy hope {{realised}} in recovering {{the body}} of my beloved and lamented son, I should have returned home somewhat comforted, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> then <b>have</b> been comparatively resigned.|$|R

6000|$|... "I would;--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{reconciled}} {{it to my}} God. But I {{might have}} been wrong," [...] he added; [...] "I might have been wrong. I only say what I should have done." ...|$|R
