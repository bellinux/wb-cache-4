5000|$|The furnace {{is built}} on a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The {{operation}} of tilting the furnace to pour molten steel is called [...] "tapping". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a tapping spout closed with refractory that washed out when the furnace was tilted, but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a taphole that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow [...] "nose" [...] of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell preheats scrap while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics.|$|E

40|$|When {{introducing}} a new farm tractor in the market, manufacturers undergo a tight homologation path {{under the supervision}} of the OECD centres technicians. Two of the most requested tests, although not mandatory for the commercialization of a tractor, are the individuation of the centre-of-gravity and of the lateral rollover angle on a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform.</b> The results of these tests are very interesting for the technical characterization of a vehicle but still far from its real working conditions, even if the <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> test forecasts, for example, the presence of fuel in the tank and the use of some weights to simulate the driver. Indeed, in this last test, no mounted implement (or equivalent mass) is connected to the tractor, hence limiting a lot the use of the results of the described tests. Therefore, a numeric stability simulator was developed to overcome this problem, thus managing the variety of the possible implements to be connected to a tractor and giving the farmers effective indications concerning their vehicles’ safety while working on hillsides. This simulator, based on a Newtonian approach, is able to compute the stability of a vehicle formed by a tractor and an implement. It was used to verify the possibility of safety using some common mounted implements with a compact wheeled articulated tractor, specifically designed to work within terraced orchards/vineyards, common in mountain areas. This tractor was chosen because of its particular architecture: it gives the tractor a higher agility and a shorter turning radius than conventional tractors with the same dimensions, but also a very different stability behaviour, maybe not completely predictable in all situations by inexperienced drivers...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{increasing}} number of fatal coach accidents with tragic consequences for passengers showed the importance of passive safety in addition to the driver’s competence and active safety. In the European countries the certification of sufficient deformation strength when overturning is compulsory for the approval of a coach according to the ECE R 66 regulation. The certification is granted after positive results from crash tests or computer simulations with partial or full bus structure. The ECE R 66 regulation defines a survival space for the passengers which must remain intact after the accident. The tests specify either the overturning of the vehicle structure from a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> or the impact of a plate on the coach structure as it would correspond to the crash of the structure when falling onto the ground. Since such tests with real vehicle structures are costly and computer efficiency, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly better and cheaper, crash simulations will play a more important role for the approval in the future. This paper will present different LS-DYNA – time simulations of the overturning test with a segment of a bus structure according to ECE R 66 and time simulations with a pivoted plate hitting with the same kinetic energy against the structure as the model falling from the <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> and crashing onto the floor. Several modelling configurations with deformable and rigid undercarriage, with different friction coefficients of the contact ground-structure, are simulated. These calculations shall serve as a preparation for future calculations to obtain the necessary certification. Unfortunately no experimental results are available at present to enable the comparison between hardware test and computer simulation. However, the experience gained with tilting tests of similar coach structures in the past indicates the trustworthiness of the calculations. As these experiences are published on the panel of a users’ meeting, this paper goes more then usual into detail regarding the modelling and the difficulties in simulations which the authors, until that time unfamiliar with LS-DYNA, has to overcome.

40|$|The motor system {{responds}} to perturbations with reflexes, {{such as the}} vestibulo-ocular reflex or stretch reflex, whose gains adapt in response to novel and fixed changes in the environment, such as magnifying spectacles or standing on a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform.</b> Here we demonstrate a reflex response to shifts in the hand’s visual location during reaching, which occurs {{before the onset of}} voluntary reaction time, and investigate how itsmagnitude depends on statistical properties of the environment.

The task-relevant discrepancies are maintained {{to the end of the}} movement, whereas the task-irrelevant discrepancies are transient such that no discrepancy exists at the end of themovement.

We find opposite directions of adaptation of the reflex response under these two distributions, with increased reflex magnitudes for task-relevant variability and decreased reflex magnitudes for task-irrelevant variability.

40|$|Background:Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} the reflex response of ankle musculature to sudden inversion in noninjured and injured subjects. To date,there have been no studies to determine the effect of versatile degrees & conditions of perturbation on the ankle musculature latency. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure and determine whether thre was a difference in ankle musculature latency measurements at 10 °, 20 °, and 30 ° in the oblique plane on a dual <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> (APS) between normal and functionally unstable ankles under different conditions of perturbation.  Methods: The musculature latency of 15 healthy subjects (8 females, 7 males; age range, 18 to 30 years) and 15 patients with functional ankle instability (FAI) (8 females, 7 males; age range, 18 to 30 years) were examined with surface EMG after sudden inversion of the ankle by APS. Results:In all angles of the oblique plane,the latency of Peroneus longus,Tibialis anterior,Peroneus brevis,and Soleus were significantly longer in subjects with unstable ankles under expected and unexpected conditions. Unexpected conditions led to increase the latency of ankle musculature, both for normal and functionally unstable ankles. Conclusion:The significantly longer onset and peak latency of ankle musculature during sudden inversion in the standing position in subjects with unstable ankles is explained by proprioceptive deficit in sensorimotor control of functionally unstable ankles. Unexpected external perturbations of body equilibrium elicit compensatory postural reflexes which cause longer latency of ankle musculature during varying angles of perturbation...|$|E

Objective: To determine whether pronated and supinated foot structures contribute to neuromuscular deficits as measured by muscle reaction time to a simulated ankle sprain mechanism. Design: Cross-Sectional Study Setting: University Biomechanics Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Thirty volunteers were categorised into three group???s dependant on navicular drop height measures. Ten participants had neutral feet (navicular drop height 5 - 9 mm), ten participants had pronated feet (navicular drop height ??? 10 mm), and ten participants had supinated feet (navicular drop height ??? 4 mm). Intervention(s) : Three perturbations on a standing <b>tilt</b> <b>platform</b> simulating the mechanics of an inversion and plantar flexion ankle sprain. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Muscle reaction time (ms) of the peroneus longus, tibialis anterior, and gluteus medius to the <b>tilt</b> <b>platform</b> perturbation. Results: Those with pronated and supinated foot structures had significantly slower peroneus longus reaction times than those with neutral feet (P =. 01 and P =. 04 respectively).

The modulation included an increase in activity in one phase of the tilt cycle {{and a decrease in}} the other phase. It is known that the motor cortex contains a large population of inhibitory GABAergic neurons. How do these neurons participate in periodic modulation of PTNs? The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of GABAA inhibitory neurons of the motor cortex in the modulation of postural-related PTN activity. Using extracellular electrodes with attached micropipettes, we recorded the activity of PTNs in cats maintaining balance on a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> both before and after iontophoretic application of the GABAA receptor antagonists gabazine or bicuculline. The tilt-related activity of 93 % of PTNs was affected by GABAA receptor antagonists. In 88 % of cells, peak activity increased by 75 ± 50 % (mean ± SD). In contrast, the trough activity changed by a much smaller value and almost as many neurons showed a decrease as showed an increase. In 73 % of the neurons, the phase position of the peak activity did not change or changed by no more than 0. 1 of a cycle. We conclude that the GABAergic system of the motor cortex reduces the posture-related responses of PTNs but has little role in determining their response timing...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that after spinalization animals lose their ability to {{maintain}} lateral stability when standing or walking. A likely {{reason for this is}} a reduction of the postural limb reflexes (PLRs) driven by stretch and load receptors of the limbs. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify whether spinal networks contribute to the generation of PLRs. For this purpose, first, PLRs were recorded in decerebrated rabbits before and after spinalization at T 12. Second, the effects of epidural electrical stimulation (EES) at L 7 on the limb reflexes were studied after spinalization. To evoke PLRs, the vertebrate column of the rabbit was fixed, whereas the hindlimbs were positioned on the platform. Periodic lateral tilts of the platform caused antiphase flexion–extension limbs movements, similar to those observed in intact animals keeping balance on the <b>tilting</b> <b>platform.</b> Before spinalization, these movements evoked PLRs: augmentation of extensor EMGs and increase of contact force during limb flexion, suggesting their stabilizing postural effects. Spinalization resulted in almost complete disappearance of PLRs. After EES, however, the PLRs reappeared and persisted for up to several minutes, although their values were reduced. The post-EES effects could be magnified by intrathecal application of quipazine (5 -HT agonist) at L 4 –L 6. Results of this study suggest that the spinal cord contains the neuronal networks underlying PLRs; they can contribute to the maintenance of lateral stability in intact subjects. In acute spinal animals, these networks can be activated by EES, suggesting that they are normally activated by a tonic supraspinal drive...|$|E

Two devices have been realized following two different concepts for vertical comb drive actuators. One device provides a <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> of 2 × 2 mm 2 which can be used to tune an optical element assembled on top of the platform. Two sets of vertically staggered comb actuators are used to create a vertical force which pulls down the platform to one or to the other side. We achieved a tilt angle of ± 3. 5 ° at 80 V in static operation. For demonstration purpose, we assembled a telecom resonant grating filter (RGF) onto the platform. We successfully scanned the entire telecom C-band (1530 - 1570 nm) by tilting the platform from - 3. 5 ° to + 3. 5 °. The other device provides a triangular mirror of 1. 7 mm edge length which is suspended by three C-shaped beams. Three sets of asymmetric vertical comb actuators are used for actuation. The mirror can perform either a pure vertical (piston) displacement of up to 18 µm at 80 V, or a tip-tilt of up to 2. 2 mrad at 50 V. The tip-tilt feature allows to correct a small wedge error with an optical component assembled on top of the device.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} cross-sectional and longitudinal {{differences in}} static and dynamic standing balance measures and lower limb muscle strength {{in patients who}} are treated chronically with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). METHODS: Twenty-six AED exposure-discordant same-gender twin and sibling pairs were studied. Clinical and laboratory balance examinations were conducted twice, separated by at least 1 year. The mean within-pair differences in balance measures were calculated cross-sectionally at baseline and follow-up, and longitudinally. RESULTS: No significant mean within-pair difference was found at baseline in age (44 years), weight, and height (p > 0. 05). Between study assessments, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval was 3. 0 (2. 1 - 4. 3) years in users and 2. 9 (2. 0 - 4. 4) years in nonusers. The median duration of AED therapy was 19 (11 - 21) years. At baseline and follow-up, cross-sectional sway measures from posturography (Chattecx Balance System) and clinical static balance tests showed poorer performance in users compared to nonusers on several test conditions (p = 0. 002 - 0. 032). At follow-up, the users took longer than nonusers to complete the Four-Square-Step Test (p = 0. 005) and Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test (p = 0. 018). A greater annual rate of deterioration in sway was found in users compared to nonusers using posturography on the anteroposterior <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> task with distraction (p = 0. 032). In both groups, higher baseline sway predicted greater annual deterioration in sway in all platform conditions (β = 0. 3 - 0. 5, p < 0. 001 - 0. 013). The annual change in measures did not differ between groups in the clinical balance and lower limb strength assessments.

40|$|Introduction: Balance {{assessment}} plays a {{major role}} in treatment and rehabilitation of patients. Recentlyscientists have designed a new device with a dynamic multi-axial <b>tilting</b> <b>platform</b> to aid in jointrehabilitation and enhance proprioceptive mechanisms and postural assessment, called Biodex balancesystem (BBS). Repetition of exposure to the BBS causes learning or familiarization. Therefore, it can’t besure that the changes seen in the stability index, are due to the effect of the learning or intervention. Thepurpose of this study was to evaluate the learning effects of test-retest postural task and to set the learningcurve and test-retest reliability of dynamic standing balance using BSS. Materials and Methods: Ten healthy non-athletic persons participated in this study. The volunteers wereasked to stand on BBS with two levels of difficulty on their dominant leg with open eyes. Two trials of 10 repetitions were applied at difficulty level of 4 and 8 with 30 minutes rest between each test and 30 minutesrest between two trials. Total stability index (TSI), anteroposterior (APSI) and mediolateral (MLSI) wereregistered. Results: The effect of repetition of hard postural task on biodex was significantly different in trial 6 from 1 - 5 (P< 0. 05). The effect of repetition of easy postural task on biodex was significantly different in trial of 5 from 1 - 4 (P< 0. 05). After learning, we found no significant difference in mean stability index of testcondition of each trials in reliability assessment so the intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 83 to 0. 92. Tests at lower stability level produced the higher ICCs (0. 90 - 0. 92). There was a very strongcorrelation between total stability index and AP stability index using Pearson correlation coefficient(P< 0. 01, r = 88 %). Conclusion: The results showed that repeating a task on the BBS for five times or more have learningeffects. So, while evaluating postural stability in a simple task which has more than five repetitions,learning effect should be take in to account and in difficult postural task it is sex repetitions that can havelearning effects...|$|E

Ankle sprains accounted for 16 % of all injuries and symptoms of functional instability were reported by 95 % of athletes that reported sustaining an ankle sprain during the study. The questionnaire was then used to recruit subjects (19 subjects with a history of unilateral ankle sprain and functional instability and 19 healthy controls) for the subsequent experiments. Anteroposterior and medio-lateral postural sway in single-limb stance was examined using a KistierTM force platform. Each subject underwent twelve postural sway tests: three on each leg with eyes open and eyes closed. With eyes closed the injured ankle had significantly greater medial (p=O. 001) and lateral (p=O. 007) postural sway than the uninjured ankle. With eyes open the injured and uninjured ankles had similar postural control. With eyes open the injured ankle had significantly greater anterior (p=O. 021, p=O. Oll) and posterior (p=O. 019, p=O. 018) postural sway than the dominant and non-dominant ankles respectively. With eyes closed the injured ankles had significantly greater medial (p=O. 008, p=O. 008) and lateral (p=O. 014, p=O. 015) postural sway than the dominant and non-dominant ankles respectively. The reaction time of peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus to a non-pathological lateral ankle sprain mechanism was examined using a purpose built <b>tilt</b> <b>platform.</b> The platform had two moveable plates so that either ankle could be tilted spontaneously into combined plantarflexion and inversion. Electromyography was performed on each muscle and subjects had each ankle tilted six times. A computer-based onset detection method was developed to provide an objective method for identifying the onset of electromyography and <b>tilt</b> <b>platform</b> activity and calculating muscular reaction times. The injured ankle peroneus longus, peroneus brevis and tibialis anterior reaction times were significantly slower (p [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{experiments}} stick insects walk on an inclined substrate {{such that the}} legs of {{one side of the}} body point uphill and the legs of the other side point downhill. In this situation the vertical axis of the body is rotated against the inclination of the substrate as if to compensate for the effect of substrate inclination. A very small effect has been found when the experiment was performed with animals standing on a <b>tilted</b> <b>platform</b> which shows that the effect depends on the behavioral context. When, however, animals first walked along the inclined surface and then, before measurement, stopped walking spontaneously, a rotation of the body has been observed similar to that in walking animals. In a second experiment it was tested whether the observed body rotation is caused by the change of direction of gravity vector or by the fact that on an inclined surface gravity necessarily has a component pulling the body sideways. Experiments with animals standing on horizontal ground and additional weights applied pulling the body to the side showed similar body rotations supporting the latter idea. In a simulation study it could be shown that the combined activity of proportional feedback controllers in the leg joints is sufficient to explain the observed behavior. This is however only possible if the gain factors of coxa-trochanter joint controller and of femur-tibia joint controller show a ratio in the order of I : 0. 05 to I : 1. 8. In order to describe the behavior of animals standing on a <b>tilted</b> <b>platform,</b> a ratio of 1 : 1. 7 is necessary. In walking animals, this body rotation requires to change the trajectories of stance and swing movements. The latter have been studied in more detail. During swing, the femur-tibia joint is more extended in the uphill legs. Conversely, the coxa-trochanter joint appears to be more elevated in the downhill legs which compensates the smaller lift in the femur-tibia joint. The results are discussed in the context of different hypotheses. ...|$|R
