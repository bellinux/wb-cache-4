50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> of Halladale was {{the seventh}} vessel {{in a series}} of eight similar iron-hulled sailing ships, all built by Russell & Co and all named after waterfalls in Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> of Halladale was preceded by <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Clyde (1878), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Bruar (1879), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Dee (1882), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Afton (1882), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Foyers (1883) and <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Earn (1884). <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> of Halladale was {{followed}} by a sister ship, <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> of Garry (1886). <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> of Clyde is afloat today and is a major attraction at the Hawaii Maritime Center in Honolulu.|$|R

5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first {{to address the problem of}} <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, {{is thought to be}} responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E
50|$|The creek {{has a small}} fishery, with {{trout and}} salmon, but only minors are allowed to fish above <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> {{a large group of}} people fish below <b>the</b> <b>falls,</b> and large salmon can be spotted jumping <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The floods of 2003 and 2006 {{actually}} helped <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> {{a lot because}} it removed most of the debris that previously lined the creek below <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Once again, due to the strong bedrock <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> flow over, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were not altered much.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>falls</b> were a {{featured}} point {{along the}} route of the Heber Creeper tourist train until the train discontinued its service past <b>the</b> <b>falls,</b> in <b>the</b> late 1980s. The train tracks in front of <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> were removed and converted into a recreational trail. Now, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> and a small park just west of <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> (Bridal Veil Park) can also be accessed via U.S. Highway 189.|$|R
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph <b>The</b> <b>Falling</b> Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E

Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo and replaces its {{characters}} {{with those from}} the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog animated series. The gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as they fall down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, while criticising the difficulty and overuse of <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> block puzzle genre.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>falls</b> are {{a barrier}} to {{upstream}} migration of some fish species. For example, the Warner sucker is only found downstream from <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> while <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> divide <b>the</b> creek's native redband trout into two distinct populations, one above <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> and another below. [...] However, <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> {{do not appear to}} be a barrier for brook trout or hatchery fish released in Deep Creek.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> Church (Anglican) is an Anglican {{parish in}} <b>the</b> city of <b>Falls</b> Church, Virginia near Washington, D.C.. In 2006, the {{congregation}} of <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> Church divided over {{the question of}} whether or not to leave the Episcopal Church, effectively creating two congregations: <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> Church (Anglican) and <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> Church (Episcopal).|$|R

5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy rations for {{the next}} day's drop. The accumulated candy was heavy, {{so in order to}} ensure the children were not hurt by <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of handkerchiefs and tied them to the rations. In the morning when Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They made these drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the group of children waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E
5|$|The Gates of Hell {{comprised}} 186 {{figures in}} its final form. Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and The Kiss, and were only later presented as separate and independent works. Other well-known works derived from The Gates are Ugolino, Fallen Caryatid Carrying her Stone, Fugit Amor, She Who Was Once the Helmet-Maker's Beautiful Wife, <b>The</b> <b>Falling</b> Man, and The Prodigal Son.|$|E

5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. <b>The</b> <b>falling</b> debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} various letters from {{different}} alphabets {{from around the}} globe in the concrete. Additionally, brick TriMet buildings at the station include an abstract pattern designed to mimic <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> cherry blossoms from the nearby trees.

5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better understand what they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and played a role in <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|During the cease-fire, {{the abbey}} offers shelter to {{refugees}} fleeing the regions affected by fallout, {{which results in}} a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp.

He is trapped by <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> walls of the abbey, and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).|$|E
5000|$|It {{is likely}} that Native American tribes knew of <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> for centuries.
