5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605–27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628–58 CE) also appeared before their subjects punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he {{considered it a}} non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> his subjects.|$|E

5|$|Infighting between Barclay's {{subordinates}} repeatedly {{prevented the}} Russian commander from committing his forces to battle. Barclay's fellow generals and the Russian court viewed the constant retreat as {{a reluctance to}} fight; consequently, he was removed from command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Kutuzov on 29 August 1812. Although the 67-year-old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as the equal of Napoleon, he possessed the ability to muster a good defence. He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov, thereby uniting the army. On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at Sarevo <b>to</b> <b>greet</b> the army.|$|E

Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E
