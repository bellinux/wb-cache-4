5|$|Armstrong {{first saw}} {{action in the}} Korean War on August 29, 1951, as an escort for a photo {{reconnaissance}} plane over Songjin. Five days later on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. While making a low bombing run at about , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of about , which sliced off about three feet (1 m) of the Panther's right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due {{to the loss of}} the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang, but his ejection seat was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No. 125122 F9F-2.|$|E

25|$|Coal, {{petroleum}} {{and their}} derivatives are delivered by boat, rail, or road. Petroleum {{and natural gas}} may also be delivered by pipeline, and coal via a Slurry pipeline. Fuels such as gasoline and LPG may also be delivered via aircraft. Natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly. The higher costs of ethanol <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> are often prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|As {{a complex}} {{chemical}} mixture {{dependent on the}} activity of microorganisms, wine can be unstable and reactive to changes in its environment. Once bottled, a wine may be exposed to extremes of temperature and humidity, as well as violent movement during <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage.</b> These may cause cloudiness, sedimentation and/or the formation of tartrate crystals; more seriously, they may also cause spoilage or the production of carbonic gas.|$|E

25|$|People {{were not}} only {{consuming}} these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% {{of the increase in}} adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger. Recent studies have also shown a negative relationship between the number of refrigerators in a household and the rate of gastric cancer mortality.|$|E
25|$|River North was {{previously}} named Smokey Hollow, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, due to the many factories and forges in the area. Smoke from the factories was often so thick that it blocked the sunlight. At the time, Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub, with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River to the surrounding areas. The now mixed-use Merchandise Mart was once a major storage warehouse for goods, and it still has railroad tracks underneath its sprawling structure. Former major retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> facility in River North. Massive coal bins were formerly located throughout the neighborhood, for storage of coal transported by ship.|$|E
25|$|The largest use {{of ozone}} {{is in the}} {{preparation}} of pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants, and many other commercially useful organic compounds, where it is used to sever carbon-carbon bonds. It can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources. Many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine. Ozone has a very high oxidation potential. Ozone does not form organochlorine compounds, nor does it remain in the water after treatment. Ozone can form the suspected carcinogen bromate in source water with high bromide concentrations. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 μmol/mol residual free chlorine in the pipes, based on results of regular testing. Where electrical power is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{efficiency of}} any type of power generation system is never reached in practice, {{and it does not}} consider other steps in power generation, such as production, <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming no heat recapture) According to the World Energy Council, this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high-temperature fuel cells (solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell's operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80%.|$|E
25|$|Being {{located in}} the center of the country has {{important}} economic implications for the state, as a number of major national highways and railways pass through. The state is also a center of industry with most of the state's major cities and economy {{located in the}} La Sierra Central and El Bajío regions.

The state has the sixth-largest economy in Mexico behind Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Nuevo León, Jalisco, and Veracruz. As of 2008, Guanajuato ranks fourth in per capita income at 7,609 USD, behind Mexico City, Nuevo León and Jalisco, with a rate of increase of 2.04%. Manufacturing accounts for 28% of total GDP, down slightly from a high of over 30%. Its importance is followed by commerce at 16.3% and real estate at 11.2%. Agriculture, which includes forestry, fishing and hunting accounts for 4.6. Other activities include financial and other professional services (17.6%) and <b>transportation</b> <b>and</b> <b>storage</b> at 11.8%. Employment figures break down differently with 13.2% employed in agriculture, 36.4% in mining and industry and 47.3 percent in commerce, services and tourism. There are two significant migration patterns in the state. Twenty-seven of 46 municipalities have a high level of migration out to other areas, with 19 having a moderate to low level of the same. The annual rate of migration to the United States is 7.07 people per thousand.|$|E

In Shabwah, CARE and Oxfam repaired damaged pumps and wells to restore access to clean water, and the German government sent a team to restore water access in Ma'rib Governorate. The widespread destruction of crop fields caused many tribes to abandon their ancestral land. Many of the residents left homeless either stayed with families or relatives, or resided in temporary shelters, where there were reports of malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea. The government provided building materials to rebuild houses. In the immediate aftermath, the local Red Cross chapter distributed about 1,300blankets, 200tents, and 200sets of cooking tools. Stagnant waters in Yemen caused a locust outbreak in August 1996 that affected Saudi Arabia for the next three months. Officials used over [...] of pesticide in response to the outbreak.
