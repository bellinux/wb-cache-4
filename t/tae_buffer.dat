40|$|We {{systematically}} {{investigated the}} effect of a <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer and external stress on the magnetic properties of magnetostrictive Fe 81 Ga 19 films deposited on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layers could effectively smoothen the rough surface of PET. As a result, the FeGa films grown on <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layers exhibit a weaker uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and lower coercivity, as compared to those films directly grown on PET substrates. By inward and outward bending the FeGa/Ta/PET samples, external in-plane compressive and tensile stresses were applied to the magnetic films. Due to the inverse magnetostrictive effect of FeGa, both the coercivity and squareness of hysteresis loops for FeGa/Ta films could be well tuned under various strains.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of perpendicular magnetization and Curie temperature (T-c) of Pt/Co/Pt thin films on the thicknesses of Pt seed (Pt-s) and presence of <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer {{has been investigated}} in this work. Pt and Co thicknesses were varied between 2 to 8 nm and 0. 35 to 1. 31 nm (across the spin reorientation transition thickness) respectively and the T-c was measured using SQUID magnetometer. We have observed a systematic {{dependence of}} T-c on the thickness of Pt-s. For 8 nm thickness of Pt-s the Co layer of 0. 35 nm showed ferromagnetism with perpendicular anisotropy at room temperature. As {{the thickness of the}} Pt-s was decreased to 2 nm, the T-c went down below 250 K. XRD data indicated polycrystalline growth of Pt-s on SiO 2. On the contrary <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer promoted the growth of Pt(111). As a consequence Ta(5 nm) /Pt(3 nm) /Co(0. 35 nm) /Pt(2 nm) had much higher T-c (above 300 K) with perpendicular anisotropy when compared to the same stack without the Ta layer. Thus we could tune the ferromagnetic T-c and anisotropy by varying the Pt-s thickness and also by introducing <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer. We attribute these observations to the micro-structural evolution of Pt-s layer which hosts the Co layer. (C) 2016 Author(s) ...|$|R

Since bromophenol blue carries a slight negative charge at moderate pH, it will migrate {{in the same direction}} as DNA or protein in a gel; the rate at which it migrates varies according to gel density and buffer composition, but in a typical 1% agarose gel in a 1X <b>TAE</b> <b>buffer</b> or TBE buffer, bromophenol blue migrates at the same rate as a DNA fragment of about 300 base pairs, in 2% agarose as 150 bp.

The {{effects of}} {{different}} relevant layers, especially the insertion layers (which are between <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer and IrMn pinning layer) and free layers, on the magnetic properties of IrMn bottom-pinning spin valves are investigated. Spin valve with a NiFe insertion layer exhibits a higher GMR ratio of ~ 6. 0 % {{than that of}} 2. 0 % for the spin valve with a Cu insertion layer due to a better pinning strength. The spin valves with a CoFe/NiFe composite free layer have relatively better magnetic properties: a higher GMR ratio compared with the spin valve with a single NiFe free layer and a lower free layer coercivity compared with the spin valve with a single CoFe layer...|$|R

Samples {{were prepared}} on either a polycrystalline Ti foil or on a silicon wafer {{covered with a}} <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> and a Cu-seed layer. The field dependence of the magnetoresistance was analyzed by decomposing the GMR into ferromagnetic (FM) and superparamagnetic (SPM) contributions, whereby the field dependence of the latter could be described by a Langevin function.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{exchange}} bias {{of more than}} 2700 Oe at room temperature in MnN/CoFe bilayers after high-temperature annealing. We studied the dependence of exchange bias on the annealing temperature for different MnN thicknesses in detail and found that samples with t_MnN> 32 nm show an increase of exchange bias for annealing temperatures higher than T_A= 400 ^∘C. Maximum exchange bias values exceeding 2000 Oe with reasonably small coercive fields around 600 Oe are achieved for t_MnN= 42, 48 nm. The median blocking temperature of those systems is determined to be 180 ^∘C after initial annealing at T_A= 525 ^∘C.

Moreover, replacing Ta with Hf causes the CoFeB/MgO interfacial PMA further enhanced by 35 %, and the CoFeB layer with perpendicular magnetization has a much larger critical thickness accordingly, leaving a wider thickness margin for the CoFeB/MgO-based perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction optimization. Also the sputter deposited thin Hf films are amorphous with low surface roughness. These results will ensure the Hf/CoFeB/MgO more promising material system for PMA device development...|$|R

While the exchange bias, coercivity, and exchange energy are greatest when the buffer layer material is (111) oriented Cu, amorphous <b>Ta</b> <b>buffers</b> allow the mu-metal to retain more of its soft magnetic character.

The structural investigation using XRD reveals the presence of single peak in all these multilayers, which indicate the formation of coherent Co/Pt (111) structure.

From the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the XRD patterns it is observed that the grain size is increasing with increasing the Pt layer thickness.

A symmetric effect is observed for up-down and down-up domain walls. This indicates the presence of right-handed domain walls, due to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) with a DMI coefficient D=+ 0. 06 mJ/m 2. The positive DMI coefficient is interpreted to be a consequence of B diffusion into the <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer during annealing, which was observed by chemical depth profiling measurements.

40|$|Typical CoFeB/MgO frames {{ensuring}} interface perpendicular {{magnetic anisotropy}} (PMA) features {{are one of}} the most reliable building blocks to meet the demand of PMA-based memory devices. However, employing the CoFeB/MgO frame with a <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer has been restricted by the rapid PMA degradation that occurs during annealing at temperatures greater than 300 °C and the need of an ultrathin CoFeB layer of approximately 1. 3 nm. Thus, the ability to enhance thermally strong PMA characteristics is still a key step toward extending their use. Here, we examine the effect of W layers on PMA features through both W buffer/CoFeB/MgO and MgO/CeFeB/W capping frames at various annealing temperatures. Highly stable PMA was achieved up to 450 °C at a specific W thickness, along with the presence of the dominant PMA properties at a relatively thick CoFeB greater than 1. 3 nm and the achievement of a high Keff of approximately 5 Merg/cc.

The effects of both <b>Ta</b> <b>buffer</b> layer and tantalum-oxide barrier layer thickness on the structural and magnetic properties and the coupling of the ferromagnetic layers have been studied. It was observed that Ta improves the structural properties of the Fe layer resulting in an increased coercive field. For a barrier thickness of 4 nm a weak decoupling starts to appear between the ferromagnetic layers and a clear step formation is observed with increasing thickness. The minor hysteresis loops predict an interlayer coupling for thin barriers. The annealing of trilayers up to 250 °C shows an increased coercivity for only the Fe layer. Annealing further at 400 °C has the opposite effect of decreasing the coercivity, indicating intermixing at the interfaces of the Fe.

In agreement with the structural studies, magnetoresistance data also indicated the formation of more perfect multilayers on the smooth Si/Ta/Cu substrates. An analysis of the magnetoresistance behaviour revealed the presence of superparamagnetic (SPM) regions in the magnetic layers.
