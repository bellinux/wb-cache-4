5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>will</b> be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E

For this, performance will be the criteria, applicable to captain, coach and players. [...] Of course the captain controls the game, the coach does his own job. Mutual trust is important. Henceforth no player/captain/coach will write or have any interaction with the media. Going to <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>will</b> lead to disciplinary action." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Stugotz' Weekend Observations" [...] — on Mondays, Stugotz {{gives his}} game {{notes from the}} {{previous}} weekend's sporting events. Before the segment, Papi claims, [...] "Nobody in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>will</b> {{tell you what happened}} better than my boy Stu." [...] Weiner frequently shouts, [...] "Daaaaan!" [...] before he gives a hot take, and has been known to use very anti-climactic knock-knock jokes. [...] After each game note, Mike gives a beep sound. Stugotz has understandably been known to put Sean Miller on blast during this segment, and often closes the segment by telling sports figures or teams that they should say hello to Art Briles in Hell. Dan Le Batard has been openly opposed to this segment, but the listeners have frequently voted in favor of this segment. In June 2016, much to the disappointment of his fans, Stugotz admitted that he doesn't write all of the game notes.|$|E

The social control function of <b>the</b> mass <b>media</b> <b>will</b> be explained. <b>The</b> course is aimed at providing a critical assessment of the social construction power of <b>the</b> mass <b>media</b> with an emphasis on images, content and context as presented in <b>the</b> mass <b>media.</b> <b>The</b> course <b>will</b> explore the images of various segments of American society as presented in <b>the</b> mass <b>media</b> including racial/ethnic groups, gender and sexual orientation, age and class.

In some cases, governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends, to avoid significant news coverage.

5000|$|Some {{observers}} {{have criticized the}} overt nature of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> manipulation in spin rooms, and <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> <b>willing</b> participation in it. Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.

50|$|The urease {{agar slant}} {{is used to}} measure an organism’s ability to produce urease, an enzyme capable to digesting urea in carbon dioxide and ammonia through hydrolysis. Because ammonia is alkaline, the media {{contains}} phenol red, an indicator that changes from orange to pink when a pH increases above 8.1.  When ammonia is increased to high enough concentrations, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>will</b> change to a pink color, indicating the presence of urease production.|$|E

50|$|The {{method of}} doing the {{traditional}} article marketing is very straightforward. The company will choose a print media business they {{want to work with}} and discuss the conditions of the article they want to produce. Once the article has been written, <b>the</b> print <b>media</b> <b>will</b> then print and publish it. Both companies will benefit from this project. <b>The</b> print <b>media</b> company <b>will</b> have content to print and the business will gain exposure for their products and/or services.

If the organization is not involved, or if the crisis is a rumor the organization can dispel, and stakeholders and the media accept that there is no crisis, no reputational harm will be done.|$|E

5000|$|A {{recent book}} written by Marshall Poe, Associate Professor of History at the University of Iowa, proposes {{a theory of}} media {{that is based on}} the {{theories}} of Innis.

Poe's theory also predicts the effects <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>will</b> have on society by considering eight attributes of a medium: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence, and searchability.|$|E
