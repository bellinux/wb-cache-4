5|$|Storms that {{approach}} <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
5|$|The cane cholla (or {{walking stick}} cholla, tree cholla, chainlink cactus, etc.) (Cylindropuntia imbricata) is a cactus found in <b>the</b> <b>Southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States and {{northern}} Mexico, including some cooler regions {{in comparison to}} many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of <b>the</b> <b>Southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada.

5|$|In {{an average}} year, the {{remnants}} of 3.1Pacific tropical cyclones affect <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. In some locations, the systems provide 30% of the annual rainfall. In New Mexico, however, stations' annual rainfall from tropical cyclones range from 10% in the western portion to less than 5% in the eastern. Rainfall from tropical cyclones affect the Albuquerque International Sunport an average of 3.9days per year. Storms affect New Mexico less than Arizona, and are generally weaker. The greatest threat from such storms are accompanying floods. Damage from tropical cyclones {{is expected to increase}} as the population increases in <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} do {{not typically}} bring high winds to <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. Most Pacific hurricanes {{are embedded in}} easterly winds south of the subtropical ridge, and thus move westward—away from large land masses—until they dissipate over cold waters. However, during early autumn, tropical cyclones generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve, or to curve again, northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. They also produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. However, many hurricanes that approach <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States tend to be undergoing extratropical transition as they encounter increased wind shear and markedly cooler sea surface temperatures, and as they interact with the deep troughs that caused them to recurve. Kathleen is one of only six recorded tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean known to have brought gale-force or hurricane-force winds to the Continental United States.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the brigade}} {{took on the}} {{additional}} responsibility of training Reserve Officer's Training Corps cadets. The 8th Brigade, 95th Division was activated as a provisional unit in charge of ROTC units throughout <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. In 2005, the division headquarters were relocated to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. This put the division at the area's major training center, allowing it to more effectively provide training oversight.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Isis spread across <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, and rainfall reached over 0.75inches (19mm) in Nevada and Utah. Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, although upper-level moisture produced light rain across the Northwestern United States; Pocatello, Idaho recorded 0.59inches (15mm), while Missoula, Montana recorded 0.39inches (10mm).|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the year}} was Hurricane Isis, which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico. Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars. It later produced sporadic rainfall in <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, leading to some traffic accidents. In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico; the nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms, all of which remained offshore. One tropical cyclone, Hurricane Lester, affected Central America, causing two deaths in Guatemala. Three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of California. Hurricane Madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|Tropical storms {{are one of}} Arizona's main {{sources of}} rainfall, as they infuse the monsoon over <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States with moisture, {{producing}} large-scale floods in occasions. However, all of the storms that have impacted Arizona have formed in the latter parts of the Pacific hurricane season, and only storm remnants have affected the state before August.|$|E
