5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.|$|E
5|$|During their {{dealings}} with the Nausets over the release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of troubles that Massasoit was experiencing. Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by Corbitant, sachem of the Narragansett tribe. A party of ten men {{under the leadership of}} Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.|$|E
5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E

5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory {{was not simply a}} matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money in one of two outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege that reduced the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
5|$|Late in its run, the Fox show Greed {{brought back}} some of its {{previous}} winners to try for an extra $1,000,000. Curtis Warren, {{who was part of}} the first team to win $1,000,000 on <b>the</b> <b>show</b> (<b>of</b> which his share was $400,000, plus $10,000 for winning a terminator round), was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 11, 2000. Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies, with eight choices (of which he had to identify the four correct answers). He successfully did so, giving himself $1,410,000 and the record for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Rather than <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> {{force that}} had been {{intended}} by the Brazilian government, the war revealed the Empire's lack of military readiness. The Army of the South, stationed in Piraí Grande, was commanded by Field Marshal João Propício Mena Barreto (later Baron of São Gabriel) with two divisions. The 1st Division, under Brigadier Manuel Luís Osório (later Marquis of Erval), was formed by regular army units. The 2nd Division, under Brigadier José Luís Mena Barreto (who had since returned from his attack on Melo), was composed entirely of national guardsmen. Altogether, it numbered only 5,711 men—all (except some officers) native to Rio Grande do Sul. The army was poorly equipped for siege operations: it brought along no engineers (who could direct the construction of trenches); it was under-equipped, lacking even hatchets (necessary to cut fences, break through doors and scale walls); and its 12 cannons (a mix of La Hitte and Paixhans) were of small calibers ill-suited to attacking fortifications.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> {{solidarity}} {{between the}} sisters {{did not last}} long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Prince Philip of Spain, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.|$|E

Hence it's expected that Immortal will continue a similar mixing production to the soundtracks to previous Cirque du Soleil's shows: 2006's Love, with the remixed music of The Beatles (to <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> the same name), and 2010's Elvis Presley-themed remix soundtrack Viva Elvis (to <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> the same name).|$|E

25|$|A second show ring, {{intended}} principally for exhibiting dairy cattle, {{was established}} {{to the north of}} the Exhibition railway line which transects the Exhibition Grounds and was ready for <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> 1924.

25|$|Things were {{different}} in Georgia, where Governor Eugene Talmadge declared martial {{law in the}} third week of the strike and directed the National Guard to arrest all picketers throughout the state, holding them in a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state only interned a hundred or so picketers, <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state.|$|E

25|$|In late January, Don Alexander, {{stationed}} in the loyalist 's-Hertogenbosch, and after <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> the Duke of Anjou at Antwerp, decided to send a substantial force led by the Spanish commanders Karl von Mansfeld and Claude de Berlaymont to begin siege works at nearby Eindhoven, an important and strategic town of northern Brabant held by about 800 to 1,200 Scottish, French and Dutch soldiers under the States' commander Hendrik van Bonnivet.|$|E

25|$|Meglia and Trillo filed {{a lawsuit}} against James Cameron and Fox Broadcasting Company, {{claiming}} that Cameron's 2000 television series Dark Angel plagiarized Cybersix. Trillo and Meglia accused <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> stealing most of the plot from the comic and its most recognizable elements. In a 2007 interview, Trillo stated that he and Meglia weren't able to carry on with the lawsuit due to lack of financial resources, so they dropped it, although the issue is still a matter of controversy.|$|E
25|$|At around 9:00p.m., the Eighth and the Seventy-First Regiments of the New York State Militia under Major-General Charles W. Sandford marched down White and Worth Streets with fixed bayonets. Accompanied by {{two police}} {{detachments}} of 75 men each, they moved {{ahead of the}} guardsmen, clubbing gangsters and rioters. Although neither regiment was at full strength, <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force was enough to panic the gangsters to flee back to their hideouts. The fighting ceased, with 500 men remaining at the City Arsenal until 4:00a.m., although police and national guardsmen continued to patrol the district into the next day.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Harmon {{left the}} show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael {{written off as}} being called on to serve the U.S. Attorney's office) {{and was replaced by}} Elisabeth Röhm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn. The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks. No mention was made on <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only supposed to be an interim DA.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, travel writer John Gunther visited Knoxville, and {{dubbed the}} city, the [...] "ugliest city" [...] in America.

[...] While Knoxvillians vigorously defended their city, Gunther's comments nevertheless sparked discussions regarding the city's unsightliness and its blue laws. [...] The ordinance forbidding <b>the</b> <b>showing</b> <b>of</b> movies on Sunday was {{done away with}} in 1946, {{with the help of}} the state legislature. [...] Knoxville legalized packaged liquor in 1961, though the issue remained a contentious one for years.|$|R
