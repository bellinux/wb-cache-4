The new PBTA represented a shift in funding and operational model of Spokane Transit System from a city model to a county-wide model. Due to rapid inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the flat $1 city tax on households that had funded Spokane Transit System was no longer {{keeping up with the}} rising costs of its era. The household tax model had another major disadvantage; because the tax depended on the quantity of households within the <b>tax</b> <b>boundaries,</b> its revenues would only increase with the construction of new households. Meanwhile, most residential growth was occurring outside Spokane city limits. Furthermore, the flat tax on households had been viewed by some as a very regressive tax.|$|E

40|$|Questions {{concerning}} {{the need to}} harmonize tax systems within national or inter-national boundaries or to allow and enforce tax competition are not a phenomenon of the last decades, but have been dealt with {{since the early days}} of taxation. The arguments and main topics of this discussion – due to the state of the art of eco-nomic thought through the ages – seem to have changed over the past centuries. Nowadays the examination of allocational and distributional aspects is the main field of research. The case of Germany at the beginning of the nineteenth century, a country consisting of 324 sovereign „statelets ” in 1791 and of „only “ 41 in 1815, is especially suitable for an historical analysis of a tax harmonization proc-ess, because the new formation of states and the newly drawn <b>tax</b> <b>boundaries</b> around 1800 give insights into the relationship between practical fiscal policy and theoretical ideas. By contrasting the arguments and the discussion of contempo-rary German authors of the early nineteenth century with modern thought on this topic it becomes clear that the issues involved are not, as one might concede, merely political and less economic, but show a certain degree of cross-fertilization. Special reference is given to the European Union and its tax har-monization efforts and tax competition reality...|$|E

Introduction of new forms of taxation, the increase of tax rates and augmentation of tax income of the Government puts a downturn risk on consumption and therefore on economic growth. Knowing that, Governments start to compete with other countries by lowering corporate tax rates and trying to boost economic growth by using foreign investments.

50|$|Chinese {{immigrants}} first {{immigrated to}} Vancouver during the 1850s owing to railway labour opportunities, coal mining {{and a gold}} rush. These early Chinese immigrants formed their own enclaves and Chinatowns in Vancouver and New Westminster because of the Sinophobia of the host society and their {{lack of knowledge of}} the English language. In the early years, Chinatown represented otherness, and was associated with crime, unleashed sexuality, opium dens, gambling, filth, run-down housing and mysterious back-alleys. Vancouver Chinatown is undergoing a period of adjustment due to a rapid rise in property assessments and <b>taxes,</b> and its <b>boundaries</b> are becoming increasingly indistinct. Chinatown's function is changing from a residential segregated racial enclave to a tourism destination and historical site. Unlike the early Chinese immigrants, recent Chinese immigrants belong to wealthier socio-economic classes and have better educational qualifications and occupational skills, so they have more options in choosing neighborhoods in which to settle and some of them immediately settle in wealthier areas of the city. Although Chinese immigrants concentrate more in east Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby, some live in affluent non-racial enclaves such as Point Grey.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} {{of open space}} from the advance of urban sprawlhas {{emerged as one of}} the more pressing environmental issues in the United States. Open space is generally understood to be a public good that will be under-provided without policy interventions. Policy-makers have begun e¤orts to protect open-space using various instruments including zoning reg-ulations, development <b>taxes,</b> urban growth <b>boundaries,</b> conservation easements, and public acquisition of undeveloped land. Increasingly, citizens are also becoming directly involved in open-space conservation through ballot initiatives designed to implement mechanisms for public land acquisition. Nearly 1, 000 jurisdictions at the state, county, and local levels held open-space referenda between 1998 and 2003, and approximately 80 percent of these initiatives passed, raising over $ 21 billion for open-space conservation. The proliferation and high success rate of open-space ballot initiatives raise several economic and policy-relevant questions. What factors contribute to the appearance of an open-space referendum in a jurisdiction? How does an initiatives funding mechanism such as a bond, property tax, sales tax, or income tax a¤ect the way citizens vote? How responsive are favorable votes to the costs of an open-space initiative? How do socioeconomic characteristic...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the Schumpeterian paradigm, this article explores {{the rise of the}} tax state in eleventh-century China and its further {{transition}} towards a fiscal state until the Mongol conquest in 1279. By the late eleventh century in the Song dynasty, two-thirds of state revenues came from taxing non-agricultural sectors, especially from the collection of excise. The Song state became the first sustainable tax state in global history, as manifested in three major aspects: monetization; indirect taxation; and centralization and professionalization in the <b>tax</b> administration. The <b>boundary</b> of the Song tax state was largely confined to urban settlements. In rural areas, the state gave up the collection of commercial taxes by farming out this right to local elites. In the twelfth century, as traditional tax revenues fell far short of supporting military defence, the Song administration utilized credit instruments. Around 1200, the amount of redeemable promissory notes first exceeded that of annual tax revenues. This shift from tax-based public finance to credit-based public finance completed the transition towards a fiscal state. Nonetheless, this development in the fiscal state was still at an early stage and proved to be unstable. Toward the end of the Southern Song, hyperinflation caused by the over-issuance of promissory notes seriously threatened the economy...|$|R
