5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian {{beliefs about the}} gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were <b>the</b> <b>elite</b> of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that <b>the</b> <b>elite</b> developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with <b>the</b> <b>elite</b> tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the strongest}} and toughest foes and allies of <b>the</b> game, <b>Elites</b> (who are from Sanghelios) are called Sangheili in the fictitious Covenant language.

Bungie concept artist Shi Kai Wang noted that project lead Jason Jones had, at one point, been insistent on giving <b>the</b> <b>Elites</b> a tail. While Wang thought it made the aliens look too animalistic, the idea was eventually dropped due to practical considerations, including where the tail would go when <b>the</b> <b>Elites</b> were driving vehicles.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{expanded}} discussion of C. W.

I propose that <b>the</b> current superior <b>elites,</b> which at <b>the</b> rate of globalization will retain its position, are <b>the</b> economic <b>elites.</b> <b>The</b> power and influence maintained by <b>the</b> economic <b>elites</b> can be exemplified through the corporations. Although this paper discusses in more detail how each of <b>the</b> Power <b>Elites</b> establish their respective relationships with one another, the intention of my presentation is to only briefly discuss these relationships and to focus on the superiority of <b>the</b> economic <b>elites.</b> <b>The</b> economic <b>elite</b> are able to impose more control and influence at a greater impact than that of a singular political and/or military body...|$|R

50|$|Weart's {{explanation}} for the democratic and the oligarchic peace is the human tendency to classify other humans into ingroup and outgroup, documented in many psychological studies. Members of the outgroup are seen as inherently inferior and thus exploitation of them is justified. Citizens of democracies include citizens of other democratic states in <b>the</b> ingroup; <b>the</b> <b>elites</b> of oligarchies include <b>the</b> <b>elites</b> of other oligarchies in the ingroup. However, <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>elites</b> and <b>the</b> democratic citizens view each other as outgroup, democracies viewing <b>the</b> <b>elites</b> as exploiting <b>the</b> rest of the population, <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>elites</b> viewing democracies as governed by inferior men and are afraid that the democratic ideals may spread to their state.|$|R

40|$|To my mind, {{although}} <b>the</b> Russian <b>elite</b> could indeed potentially {{play the}} role of the alternative pole to <b>the</b> transnational <b>elite,</b> still, this is rather unlikely as long as <b>the</b> present Kremlin <b>elite</b> attempts to compromise the interests of the internationalised part of <b>the</b> economic <b>elite</b> with those of the “national” part of it. This is because the former part of <b>the</b> economic <b>elite,</b> with <b>the</b> full support of <b>the</b> transnational <b>elite,</b> is still very strong and with open and liberated markets could cause havoc to <b>the</b> Russian political <b>elite.</b> <b>The</b> flight of capital and the closing of the Russian stock exchange were just warning shots on {{what would happen to the}} Russian economy if its political elite wished to play any real independent role from that prescribed to it by <b>the</b> transnational <b>elite.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> only real possibility for <b>the</b> Russian political <b>elite</b> to play <b>the</b> role of an alternative pole would arise in case <b>the</b> transnational <b>elite</b> pushes it into “a corner” by fully encircling it militarily in which case either <b>the</b> present <b>elite,</b> or perhaps a more nationalistic one in the future, could well take the necessary economic and political measures to achieve a break from the dependence on <b>the</b> transnational <b>elite...</b>|$|R

5|$|As social centres castles were {{important}} places for display. Builders {{took the opportunity}} to draw on symbolism, through the use of motifs, to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst <b>the</b> <b>elite.</b> Later structures of the Romantic Revival would draw on elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch– though it was not always necessary– was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by <b>the</b> <b>elite.</b> Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.|$|E

50|$|Zitelmann {{criticizes the}} fact that, {{when it has}} {{considered}} <b>the</b> economic <b>elite,</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>elite</b> research has focused too one-sidedly on executives employed by large corporations and major banks.

Senior executives in large corporations who can, in all likelihood, influence national political decisions. 2. <b>The</b> wealth <b>elite,</b> namely those individuals who sit {{at the top of}} the wealth pyramid. Zitelmann sets the minimum threshold for <b>the</b> wealth <b>elite</b> at net assets of EUR 10 million. <b>The</b> wealth <b>elite</b> is primarily composed of entrepreneurs and investors. Academic researchers have so far paid too little attention to this group. According to Zitelmann, this has led to statements on the social homogeneity and the recruitment mechanisms of <b>the</b> wealth <b>elite</b> being distorted, as they are derived from research which has mainly focused on employed executives.|$|R

Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale body armour, a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal.
