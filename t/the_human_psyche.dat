Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old. Realising that the object is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own, and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>psyche.</b>|$|E

In 1958 they met Leonard Baskin, who would later illustrate many of Hughes's books, including Crow. The couple returned to England, staying {{for a short while}} back in Heptonstall and then finding a small flat in Primrose Hill, London. They were both writing, Hughes working on programmes for the BBC as well as producing essays, articles, reviews and talks. During this time he wrote the poems that would be published in Wodwo (1967) and Recklings (1966). In March 1960 Lupercal came out and won the Hawthornden Prize. He found he was being labelled as the poet of the wild, writing only about animals.

25|$|In modern Western astrology {{the planets}} {{represent}} basic drives or impulses in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>psyche.</b> These planets {{differ from the}} definition of a planet in astronomy in that the sun, moon, and recently, Pluto and Ceres (considered as dwarf planets in astronomy), are all considered to be planets for the purposes of astrology. Each planet is also said to be the ruler of one or two zodiac signs. The three modern planets have each been assigned rulership of a zodiac sign by astrologers and Ceres has been suggested as the ruler of Taurus or Virgo. Traditionally rulership of the signs was, according to Ptolemy, based on seasonal derivations and astronomical measurement, whereby the luminaries being the brightest planets were given rulership of the brightest months of the year and Saturn the coldest furthest classical planet was given to the coldest months of the year, with the other planets ruling the remaining signs as per astronomical measurement. It is noteworthy that the modern rulerships do not follow the same logic.|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s, Lacan's structuralist {{theories}} about Hamlet were first {{presented in a}} series of seminars given in Paris and later published in [...] "Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in Hamlet". Lacan postulated that <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>psyche</b> is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of Hamlet shed light on human desire. His point of departure is Freud's Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through Hamlet. In Lacan's analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of phallus—the cause of his inaction—and is increasingly distanced from reality [...] "by mourning, fantasy, narcissism and psychosis", which create holes (or lack) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche. Lacan's theories influenced literary criticism of Hamlet because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of semantics to explore the play's psychological landscape.|$|E

To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents.

5000|$|The last motif, which Roy also {{focused on}} his 2008 [...] "Syncretism" [...] series, is also joined by [...] "abstract works" [...] (abstract {{in the sense that}} they utilize Non-Objectivist visualities in painting) that combine both fluid color-washes (of the style {{associated}} with Louis Morris) with thick, nervously-drawn gestural strokes with thick textures (like Sam Frances as loosened up by graffiti art), but combined in a visual montage of bright colors and sensual forms verging on an erotic descriptive intermingled with the materiality of daily life. This is then re-read into the artist's vision of nature and human experience, becoming palimpsests wherein we (as him) occupy surrealist-like dreams of wonder and regret ("Catching Clouds in Polychrome", [...] "Seen and Unseen", and [...] "Dawn Dispersed the Night"), narrate ironic metacommentaries of elitist consumerism ("Corporate Chic" [...] or [...] "Subliminal Abstract"), or a poetic return from civilizational (because patriarchal) hypocrisy towards a non-judgmental Nature that is motherly and nurturing ("Fragile Blue Sky"). The key to understanding these double-coded works is Roy's invocation of [...] "pareidolia", or <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>psyche's</b> ability to recognize patterns from otherwise random forms. Also, the Latin 'alucinari' is flagged, as in the hallucinatory effect of dreams, mirages, and coded symbols that may mean nothing and everything at the same time.|$|R
500|$|In the {{literary}} Solaris, Lem describes science's inadequacy in allowing humans {{to communicate with}} an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient extra-terrestrial life may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the cinematic Solaris, Tarkovsky concentrates upon Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, {{and the impact of}} outer space exploration upon the human condition. Dr. Gibarian's monologue [...] is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says, [...] "We don't need other worlds. We need mirrors". Unlike the novel, which begins with psychologist Kris Kelvin's spaceflight, and occurs entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin's visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth for Solaris. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives – [...] a vibrantly living Earth versus an austere, closed-in space station orbiting the planet Solaris – demonstrating and questioning space exploration's impact upon <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>psyche.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{overarching}} theme of Eternal Punishment, as with Persona and Innocent Sin, was exploration of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>psyche</b> {{and the main}} characters discovering their true selves. While Innocent Sin focused on the protagonists as teenagers, Eternal Punishment looked at the protagonists as adults: for its central character theme, Eternal Punishment focused on how people realize their true selves as adults faced with reality. A theme carried over from Innocent Sin was the [...] "power of Kotodama", the Japanese belief that words can influence the physical and spiritual world, with this power manifesting through the spreading of rumors. Terms and concepts used in the games, including Persona, Shadows and the character Philemon, were drawn from Jungian psychology and archetypes.

Dewdney's past books were described as being [...] "more admired than read". On the topic of 'the night', he had a lifelong fascination with nightlife and eventually decided {{to write a book}} about it. He quickly became overwhelmed by the amount of information relating to the subject. For research, he consulted a variety of genres and formats, including books, journals, magazines, music, and movies, and collected information within the broad topics of art, science, social sciences and history. The perspective Dewdney took was that of [...] "explaining night to beings from another planet that had two opposed suns and no night at all".|$|E
