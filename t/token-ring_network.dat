The system {{was the first}} large scale legislative implementation of a <b>token-ring</b> <b>network.</b> It {{was one of the}} first government systems to utilize electronic mail to transfer documents.|$|E
50|$|Another feature was its {{proprietary}} <b>token-ring</b> <b>network,</b> {{which was}} {{originally designed to}} support relatively small networks of, at most, dozens of computers in an office environment. It was a superb design, allowing direct memory access page faulting from any hard drive on the network, {{but it did not}} inter-operate with any other existing network hardware or software. The industry widely adopted Ethernet and TCP/IP, a more universal, albeit much slower network. Apollo later added support for these industry standards while continuing to support its own Domain networking using both Ethernet and Token Ring. The Domain networking was modeled after Xerox Network Systems.|$|E

In the first scenario, how the transmission of routine management messages impacts performance of the DMS is examined.

Protocol, called round-robin priority scheme (RRPS), introduces only small overhead and therefore degrades system performance only minimally.

40|$|A novel {{preemption}} scheme {{based on}} priority scheduling, which we call `soft preemptive protocol', is presented for slotted-ring local area networks where stations generate multiple-priority messages. The protocol follows preemption rules governed by delay deadlines imposed on the waiting times. Simulations are furnished for comparison with a classical, nonpreemptive protocol. 1 Introduction Slotted-ring protocols have emerged {{with the introduction of}} the Cambridge Ring in early 1980 's [7]. Typically, a ring network assumes a circular topology where messages travel in one direction. A number of stations are connected to the ring, where several fixed-length slots are available for transmission. Each station sends a message by writing the data into a free slot. Medium access control layer protocols developed for ring networks are evaluated and compared to <b>token-ring</b> <b>networks</b> in [8]. Slotted-ring local area networks that were proposed in the past to handle multiple-priority jobs also in [...] ...|$|R

Proposed asynchronous local-area digital communication network (LAN) carries synchronous voice, data, or video signals, or non-real-time asynchronous data signals. Network uses double buffering scheme that reestablishes phase and frequency references at each node in network. Concept demonstrated in <b>token-ring</b> <b>network</b> operating at 80 Mb/s, pending development of equipment operating at planned data rate of 200 Mb/s.

40|$|Process algebras are {{suitable}} for describing networks of communicating processes. In most process algebras, the description of such networks is achieved using parallel composition operators. Noticing that the parallel composition operators commonly found in process algebras are often limited in expressiveness and/or difficult for novice users, we propose a new parallel operator that allows networks of communicating processes to be described easily, in a simple and well-structured manner. We illustrate on various examples (<b>token-ring</b> <b>network</b> and client-server protocol) the theoretical and practical merits of this operator. Keywords: Concurrency, E-Lotos, Formal Description Technique, Lotos, Process Algebra, Protocol. 1. INTRODUCTION Process algebras have been designed as a theoretical framework {{for the study of}} concurrency. Classical examples of process algebras are: ACP [BK 84], CCS [Mil 80; Mil 89], CSP [Hoa 85], MEIJE [dS 85], etc. There also exist specification languages combining pro [...] ...|$|E
40|$|FDDI {{is one of}} {{the latest}} {{evolutions}} in shared-media technology. Original intended as a high-speed backbone tor interconnecting networks, it has become a viable alternative tor organizations that seek better response time and bandwidth capacity from their local area networks (LANs). However, this fiber- based standard is an expensive departure from the more similar, and perhaps more mature, IEEE 802 token-ring and Ethernet standards. Thus, developing an FDDI- based network may present considerable economic and technical risk to an organization. This study examines the application of FDDI technology as an upgrade to the Systems Management Department's <b>token-ring</b> <b>network.</b> It reviews the protocols that comprise the standard, addresses design considerations for developing an FDDI network, evaluates the existing token-ring LAN, and proposes an FDDI solution. This study concludes that the risks of implementing an FDDI- based upgrade, can be mitigated using an evolutionary design strategy. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|E
40|$|In polling systems, M 2 queues are {{visited by}} a single server in cyclic order. These systems model such diverse {{applications}} as <b>token-ring</b> communication <b>networks</b> and cyclic production systems. We study polling systems with exhaustive service and zero switchover (walk) times. Under standard heavy-traffic assumptions and scalings, the total unfinished work converges to a one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion, whereas the workloads of individual queues change {{at a rate that}} becomes infinite in the limit. Although it is impossible to obtain a multidimensional limit process in the usual sense, we obtain an `averaging principle' for the individual workloads. To illustrate the use of this principle, we calculate a heavy-traffic estimate of waiting times. Keywords: Polling systems, cyclic servers, diffusion approximations, heavy-traffic limits.

In addition, a DC-free 2 -user binary coding scheme, together with its trellis structure, is introduced and investigated. It is {{shown that the}} new technique provides about 2 dB energy gain {{in comparison with the}} conventional techniques. A useful and interesting application of this technique would be the <b>token-ring</b> local area <b>network</b> where the number of users can be increased without bandwidth expansion...|$|R

This design features fiber optic channels between stations on the network {{without the use of}} a wiring concentrator. The initial LAN electrical signal operating at 4 Mbps was provided by a LAN adapter card based on the TMS 380 chipset developed for twisted pair copper wire. Since the physical characteristics of fiber and wire vary, use of this adapter necessitated that the design be able to deceiver system Successful LAN communications over the fiber optic channels are described.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{to reconfigure}} a fault-tolerant double-loop <b>token-ring</b> local area <b>network</b> following topological changes is presented. The algorithm guarantees {{that at all}} operational times the net-work is organized to provide maximum possible connectivity among the nodes- either one loop that encompasses all nodes in the network or several subloops each of which operates as a separate token ring network. Tokens are generated or eliminated as necessary to result in one and only one token in each (sub) loop. The algorithm is formally specified and its properties are verified. Token ring is a well known architecture for local area networks (LANs) which is preferred by many over the bus architecture because of its inherent advantages: 1. High speed- a token ring can operate at speeds of hundreds of Mbps which are much higher than is practical for bus LANs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{stochastic}} Petri nets (SPNs) {{that can be}} used for the evaluation of polling mechanisms. Polling mechanisms (or systems) appear in many forms in computer-communication systems: the well-known <b>token-ring</b> and token-bus <b>network</b> access schemes such as present in IEEE P 802. 4 / 5 and in FDDI, and the scheduling mechanisms in switching fabrics, e. g., for ATM systems, operate along the lines of polling systems. Polling systems have been studied for many years now, and many analytical techniques have been developed to study them. It seems, however, that a number of system aspects can not be covered adequately by such analytical approaches. Most notably are time-dependent polling variants where the amount of service a station receives per visit is time-limited, load-dependent polling strategies where the ordering of station visits is dependent on the loading of the stations, as well as non-Poisson arrival processes. Therefore, we present SPN-based models that allow us to cope with these system aspects. The two major problems that appear when taking the SPN approach are the size of the underlying CTMC and the use of non-exponential timing. The latter problem is not really addressed in this paper; rather it is circumvented by employing the well-known method of stages, thus even worsening the state-space size problem. The first problem is coped with, by presenting two decomposition approaches and by presenting a subclass of SPNs that allows for an efficient matrix-geometric solution, thus avoiding the explicit generation of the overall state space...|$|R
50|$|John Akers became IBM's CEO in 1985. During the 1980s, IBM's {{significant}} {{investment in}} building a world class research organization produced four Nobel Prize winners in physics, achieved breakthroughs in mathematics, memory storage and telecommunications, and made great strides in expanding computing capabilities. In 1980, IBM Research legend John Cocke introduced Reduced Instruction Set Technology (RISC). Cocke received both the National Medal of Technology and the National Medal of Science for his innovation, but IBM itself failed to {{recognize the importance of}} RISC, and lost the lead in RISC technology to Sun. In 1984 the company partnered with Sears to develop a pioneering online home banking and shopping service for home PCs that launched in 1988 as Prodigy. Despite a strong reputation and anticipating many of the features, functions, and technology that characterize the online experience of today, the venture was plagued by extremely conservative management decisions, and was eventually sold in the mid-1990s. The IBM <b>token-ring</b> local area <b>network,</b> introduced in 1985, permitted personal computer users to exchange information and share printers and files within a building or complex. In 1988, IBM partnered with the University of Michigan and MCI Communications to create the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet), an important step {{in the creation of the}} Internet. But within five years the company backed away from this early lead in Internet protocols and router technologies in order to support its existing SNA cash cow, thereby missing a boom market of the 1990s. Still, IBM investments and advances in microprocessors, disk drives, network technologies, software applications, and online commerce in the 1980s set the stage for the emergence of the connected world in the 1990s.|$|R
