25|$|Aix-les-Bains {{has nearly}} 500 shops. These are, {{for the largest}} number, present in the town centre. Merchants benefit from the {{attractiveness}} of the geographical situation of the commune with {{the proximity of the}} lake and the Massif des Bauges, but also thanks to the casino. However, its aging image as well as competition from neighbouring communes tend to undermine the Aix shops. Indeed, the peripheral communes such as Tresserve, Grésy-sur-Aix, Albens or even Le Bourget-du-Lac attract ever slightly more local clientele. On the other hand, the Chambéry area is facing competition from the area of activity of Les Landiers, where most of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>names</b> are, such as Darty, la Halle aux vêtements, Feu vert, but also the large Carrefour hypermarket. This presence has forced the town of Chambéry to revitalize its own town centre. Aix-les-Bains shops have, in this general situation, struggled to survive and attract potential customers.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>names</b> {{added to the}} offense, the Tiger-Cats {{struggled}} immediately and badly. On July 10, 2006, the Tiger-Cats relieved head coach Greg Marshall of his duties after an 0–4 start, appointing 67-year-old veteran head coach Ron Lancaster as his replacement. The team also fired offensive co-ordinator Joe Paopao, offensive line coach Kani Kauahi, and replaced interim general manager since 2005 Rob Katz with former Montreal assistant GM Marcel Desjardins later in the season. Before the Tiger-Cats' Labour Day Classic game against Toronto, Hamilton was in last place in the East Division. Maas was seventh {{in the league in}} passing yardage, tied for seventh in touchdown passes, and tied for second in interceptions. Two of the players ahead of Maas in yardage and touchdowns, Dave Dickenson and Kerry Joseph, had struggled with injuries during the season, and the player tied with Maas's seven touchdowns was British Columbia backup Buck Pierce. The Tiger-Cats would fall to 2–10 after Labour Day, with Maas getting no credit in a 40–6 pummelling by the Argonauts.|$|E

25|$|St Helens' former stadium was Knowsley Road, renamed in 2008 to the GPW Recruitment Stadium for {{sponsorship}} reasons. Prior to this, {{in particular}} when St Helens were playing simply rugby football, {{they shared the}} City Ground with St Helens Recs. They left this stadium in 1890 for Knowsley Road and played there for 120 years. The ground {{at the time of}} its construction was considered modern, with one seated stand, and three standing areas that could, prior to strict safety regulations set in place, hold up to 40,000 people, shown by their record home crowd of 35,695 against Wigan in 1949. In their first match at the new ground, St Helens beat Manchester Rangers, played under rugby football rules. After the great schism of 1895, and St Helens joining the NRFU, their first game at Knowsley Road under traditional rugby league rules was against Rochdale, in front of 3,000 spectators. Over the years, however, age took its toll on the ground. Despite <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>names</b> like Meninga, van Vollenhoven, Lyon etc. coming to the club, it was constantly argued that, unlike other big clubs, St Helens did not have the stadium to suit their on—field talent. In 2006, the ground was treated to something of a makeover, after financial input from St Helens big money sponsors Earth Money. This aided the ground in gaining international rugby, with a fixture between Great Britain and New Zealand being held there in 2006. However, in 2008, St Helens were given a warning letter from the RFL, as a result of the ensuing licensing system that was to be introduced into Super League in 2009, stating that the quality of their current stadium was too poor for the expected quality of a licence in the league. Thankfully for Saints, they were permitted by the council to begin construction on a new ground, and confirmed that they would move away from Knowsley Road in 2011. It was announced that the new complex, to be built on an unused glass site in Peasley Cross, was to feature at least 12,000 seats, a large car park, and a Tesco store next to the ground. In addition to this, an iconic bridge, directly linking the ground to the town centre went under construction on 9 August 2010. Whether the stadium would be ready for the beginning of the 2011 season was always uncertain, and grounds such as Leigh Sports Village were suggested to home Saints for the period between. However, the Halton Stadium, Widnes was the chosen venue for Saints for the 2011 season, and they will play all of their home games there before permanently relocating in 2012. Saints currently play at the Totally Wicked Stadium.|$|E

Oz Clarke described a view of Chardonnay as [...] "...the ruthless coloniser and destroyer of the world's vineyards and the world's palates." [...] The criticism was centered on the habits of winemakers to pull out or give up on local varieties in order to plant more Chardonnay which offered potentially more income but lack the uniqueness and character of local varieties. Examples of this occurred in south Italy and Spain when ancient Negroamaro, Primitivo, Grenache and Mataro vineyards were ripped up in favor of new Chardonnay plantings. Despite the backlash, Chardonnay remains very popular. In 2004 Chardonnay was estimated to be the world's 6th most widely grown grape variety, covering [...]|$|E
