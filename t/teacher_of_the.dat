40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was}} to {{determine}} if there were significant differences in <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> job satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf in residential and day school/class programs. Four selected subpopulations <b>of</b> these <b>teachers</b> were also compared. The Purdue Teacher Opinionaire was utilized to obtain <b>teacher</b> perceptions <b>of</b> job satisfaction. A questionnaire was utilized to obtain demographic data. Five major null hypothesis were tested by the multivariate and univariate analysis of variance. Findings 1. Day school/class and residential school <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 2. Male and female <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 3. Normal hearing <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf and deaf <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 4. <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf in various age groups were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. 5. <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf with daily contact with deaf colleagues and those without daily contact with deaf colleagues were found to be significantly different in levels of job satisfaction. Conclusions 1. <b>The</b> type <b>of</b> school (residential or day) does have an influence on job satisfaction levels <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf. 2. There are significant differences in levels of job satisfaction between <b>the</b> following subgroups <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf: male and female; hearing and deaf; age ranges 20 - 25, 26 - 35, 36 - 45, and over 45; and teachers with daily contact with deaf colleagues and teachers without daily contact with deaf colleagues.

5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful <b>teacher</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|History of the hermitage is {{traced to}} the 9th century when Padmasambhava (Padma ’byung gnas) meditated here.

Over the centuries, the monastery has seen many leading lights of the Tibetan monastic order playing a role in its building, such as the Zhang ’gro ba’i mgon po g.yu brag pa (1123–1193), female saint Ma cig lab sgron, Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho’s (1641–1713), Ngawang Jampa (Phur lcog sku phreng dang po ngag dbang byams pa, 1682–1762) and Pan chen blo bzang ye shes (1663–1737). Royal family members like the Queen Tsering Trashi (Rgyal mo tshe ring bkra shis) and the Tibetan King Pho lha nas (1689–1747) also {{supported}} the activities of the hermitage.
