40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a desk study to investigate recharge in an area of discontinuous low permeability till in the Waveney catchment. Within the study area the till is absent in the valley of the River Waveney and also in the lower parts of some of the tributary valleys. The study develops a methodology to identify the main recharge areas and make initial estimates of recharge in such hydrogeologically complex areas. Following earlier work on Chalk recharge through till this combined study area was selected to include both the Chalk and the Crag aquifers. It was thought that the difference between these two aquifers may shed further light on the recharge mechanisms through the overlying till. The main outcomes of the study have been: 1. A recharge estimate methodology is devised based on the effective rainfall, the till thickness, estimates of runoff from the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> and delimiting the main recharge areas where the till is thin or absent. 2. The infiltration through thick till (> 10 m) is low and as a consequence, runoff from the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> is large and is potentially a significant component of recharge at the margins of the <b>till</b> <b>sheet.</b> Estimating the quantity of water that may runoff the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> is essential when attempting to assess the amount and distribution of groundwater recharge. 3. An important issue, when considering catchment water balances, is the relative proportion of runoff that infiltrates to groundwater at the margins of the <b>till</b> <b>sheet,</b> compared with that which flows directly into the river. It has not been possible in this study to devise a methodology to split these two components. More catchment scale studies are required to evaluate how catchment characteristics influence the infiltration rates. 4. The time-lag between rain falling at the soil surface and recharge arriving at the water table will be relatively short at the margins of the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> where the water table is generally shallow. This has important implications for water quality, as widespread changes in land-use are likely to be observed more rapidly in groundwaters {{at the edge of the}} sheet than in areas of extensive Chalk-Crag outcrop...|$|E
40|$|High-density {{regional}} geochemical {{data for}} surface soils in central England and East Anglia reveal {{that much of}} their geochemical character is inherited from the tills that they are developed upon. Multivariate statistical analysis highlighted three significant element associations of Al-Fe-Ga-K-La-Mg-Rb, Ca-Sr and K-Fe accounting for almost 93 % of the geochemical variability of soils derived from tills. Provenancing the geochemical signatures of the latter elements enabled the construction of ice flow paths associated with two different Middle Pleistocene ‘chalky’ till sheets. A lower <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> relating to ‘Pennine’ ice flowing from west to east across the region, and an upper <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> deposited by North Sea ice moving into northern East Anglia, and {{to the west of}} the Fen Basin, before fanning-out across central England. Overall, geochemical signatures of different till units are largely derived from local bedrock sources, with dilution and a new geochemical signature acquired as the ice flows over and incorporates new bedrock lithologies. The results show that high resolution soil geochemical data provides a further proxy with which the flow paths of former ice sheets can be delineated...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a project to investigate the Chalk-till groundwater system in East Anglia and to estimate rates of recharge to the Chalk aquifer through thick Lowestoft Till (chalky boulder clay). The project has involved drilling two cored boreholes, monitoring groundwater levels, sampling Chalk and till fracture waters and porewaters, numerical modelling of groundwater levels {{and the development of a}} conceptual model of the Chalk-till groundwater system. The main findings of the report are that: • the till has a significant impact on recharge quantity and distribution to the underlying Chalk aquifer. Beneath the interfluves recharge appears to be lower than previous estimates of 20 – 40 mm/a (Klink et al., 1996; Soley and Heathcote, 1998), maybe as low as 5 mm/a; • the Chalk groundwater beneath the interfluves is old (probably a minimum of several hundreds of years) and has negligible nitrate concentrations. This groundwater makes only a relatively small contribution to the active circulation system in the valleys; • recharge rates to the Chalk aquifer at the edge of the till are greater than the effective rainfall (rainfall minus actual evapotranspiration) because of the contribution of large volumes of runoff from the <b>till</b> <b>sheet.</b> This water characterises the modern (post- 1960 s), high-nitrate, groundwaters of the main Chalk valleys with potentially short travel times from recharge to discharge. The arable land on the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> has had field drains installed and these contribute to the bulk of the runoff; as a consequence nitrate concentrations in the runoff are high; • the Chalk-till groundwater system and the spatial distribution of recharge to the Chalk aquifer determine the shape and dimensions of the catchment areas of abstraction boreholes. This in turn controls the proportion of modern water pumped by abstraction boreholes, which has implications for the concentration of nitrate in pumped water. One consequence of the redistribution of recharge by the till is that boreholes close to the edge of the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> are likely to pump a greater proportion of modern recharge than previously believed and these are likely to produce water with higher nitrate concentrations; • the Chalk groundwaters at the edge of the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> are vulnerable to pollution because of the potentially high recharge rates (due to runoff recharge) and the relatively shallow depth to the water table. As a consequence, travel times through the unsaturated zone may be short...|$|E

50|$|The {{complexity}} of the glacial period and its subdivision into several glacial epochs, separated by interglacial epochs of considerable length (certainly longer than the postglacial epoch) has a structural consequence in the superposition of successive <b>till</b> <b>sheets,</b> alternating with non-glacial deposits. It also has a physiographic consequence in the very different amount of normal postglacial erosion suffered by the {{different parts of the}} glacial deposits. The southernmost drift sheets, as in southern Iowa and northern Missouri, have lost their initially plain surface and are now maturely dissected into gracefully rolling forms. Here, the valleys of even the small streams are well opened and graded, and marshes and lakes are rare. These sheets are of early Pleistocene origin. Nearer the Great Lakes, the <b>till</b> <b>sheets</b> are trenched only by the narrow valleys of the large streams. Marshy sloughs still occupy the faint depressions in the till plains and the associated moraines have abundant small lakes in their undrained hollows. These drift sheets are of late Pleistocene origin.|$|R
50|$|The {{fertility}} of the prairies is {{a natural}} consequence of their origin. During the mechanical transportation of the till no vegetation was present to remove the minerals essential to plant growth, {{as is the case}} in the soils of normally weathered and dissected peneplains. The soil is similar to the Appalachian piedmont which though not exhausted by the primeval forest cover, are by no means so rich as the <b>till</b> <b>sheets</b> of the prairies. Moreover, whatever the rocky understructure, the till soil has been averaged by a thorough mechanical mixture of rock grindings. Hence the prairies are continuously fertile for scores of miles together. The true prairies were once covered with a rich growth of natural grass and annual flowering plants, but today are covered with farms.|$|R
40|$|Many {{explanations}} {{have been}} provided for variations of the spatial distribution and thickness of till sheets. This paper gives new insight into the architecture of a stratigraphically distinct <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> {{as a function of}} the type of substratum and preadvance topography at a scale of similar to 10 km. This emphasises the sensitivity of the subglacial system to changes in the basal drainage conditions. The study area is the forefield of Slettjokull at the northern margin of the Myrdalsjokull ice cap, central south Iceland. Here, detailed lithostratigraphical and sedimento logical investigations, including mapping of the thickness for two till units, sediment logging, clast fabric and geotechnical measurements provide a basis for interpretations. The results show that the thickness of a stratigraphically distinct <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> is directly correlated to the type of substratum. Where the substratum consists of sorted sediments the till is thin. Conversely, the till is thick where the substratum consists of till overlying sorted sediments. A sedimentological model is presented in which till thickness is tied to the variable hydraulic conditions experienced in a deforming subglacial bed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The complex glacial {{geomorphology}} and stratigraphy of the Solway Lowlands (Cumbria, UK) reflects dynamic ice flow {{during the}} Main Late Devensian Glaciation, with numerous ice-flow shifts, and re-advances now recognised. The final incursion of Scottish ice {{into the region}} (Scottish Re-advance) during a late stage of deglaciation has provoked widespread debate and even scepticism arising from ill-defined marginal limits, and a paucity of landforms, sediments and dates. In an attempt to resolve {{some of these issues}} this paper has applied both geomorphological and stratigraphic techniques to critically review evidence pertaining to the Scottish Re-advance. A major deltaic landform-sediment assemblage at Holme St. Cuthbert; a thin, patchy till sheet; and eskers at Thursby and Sowerby Wood verify that Scottish ice re-advanced into the Solway Lowlands at a late stage of deglaciation. The thin, patchy <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> associated with the re-advance is indicative of a short-lived pulse, with ice thought to have flowed rapidly across water-saturated sediment and into proglacial lakes dammed up against higher ground to the east. The Holme St. Cuthbert delta, which evolved from a subaqueous outwash fan marks a major still-stand and development of a large ice-contact lake in the vicinity of Wigton. The extent of the glaciation is difficult to elucidate, with the <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> disparately exposed as far east as Lannercost although identification of the Blackhall Wood Re-advance Till member probably limits its SE extent to just south of Carlisle. Coeval re-advance of Lake District ice is possible given that a final stage lobate movement of ice out of the Vale of Eden and into the Solway Lowlands is now recognised, however there is no direct stratigraphic correlation or dating control. ...|$|E
40|$|The Dummer Complex extends 180 km {{along the}} Precambrian - Paleozoic contact from Tamworth to Lake Simcoe. It is {{composed}} of coarse, angular Paleozoic clasts in discontinuous, pitted, hummocky deposits. Deposits are usually separated by bare or boulder strewn bedrock, but {{have been found in}} the southern drumlinized <b>till</b> <b>sheet.</b> Dummer Complex deposits show rough alignment with ice-flow. Eskers cross-cut many of the deposits. Dummer sediment subfacies are defined on the basis of dominant coarse grain size and lithology, which relate directly to the underlying Paleozoic formation. Three subglacial tills are identified based on the degree of comminution and distance of transport; the immature facies of the Dummer Complex; the mature facies of the drumlinized <b>till</b> <b>sheet</b> and; the submature facies which is transitional. Carbonate geochemistry was used for till-bedrock correlation in various grain sizes. Of the 3 Paleozoic formations underlying the Dummer Complex, the Gull River Fm. is geochemically distinctive from the Bobcaygeon and Verulam Formations using Ca, Mg, Sr, Cu, Mn, Fe and Na. The Bobcaygeon Fm. and Verulam Fm. can be differentiated using Ca and the Sr/Ca ratio. The immature facies from 1. 0 phi and finer is dominated by the non-carbonate, long distance transported component which decreases slightly downice. The submature till facies contains more long distance material than the immature facies. Sr and Mn can be used to correlate the Gull River immature till facies to the underlying bedrock the other subfacies could not be distinguished from each other or their respective source formation. This method proved to be ineffective for sediments with greater than 35 % non-carbonate component, due to leaching of elements by the dissolving acid. The Dummer Complex is produced subglacially, as the compressional ice encounters the permeable Paleozoic carbonates. The increased shear strength of the ice and pore pressures in the carbonates results in the basal ice zones becoming debris ladden. Cleaner ice overrides the basal debris. laden dead ice which then acts as the glacier bed. During retreat, the Simcoe lobe stagnates as flow is cut-off by the Algonquin Highlands...|$|E

40|$|The {{continental}} margin {{in the area}} west of Shetland was subjected to repeated and extensive ice sheet advances during the Late Pleistocene. Seabed imagery, seismic survey and borehole core data show the Late Devensian ice sheets expanded across the continental shelf three times, two of these advances reaching the shelf edge. On the inner shelf, where present-day water depths are generally less than 100 m, only thin sediments from the last retreat phase and exposed rock surfaces remain, all other deposits from earlier phases having been removed by the last advance. On the mid to outer shelf elements of all three phases are preserved, including lodgement and deformation tills, melt-out and water-lain <b>till</b> <b>sheets,</b> in-filled hollows left by stagnant ice decaying in situ {{and a series of}} large recessional and terminal moraines. In addition, there is evidence of shallow troughs and overdeepend basins which indicate preferential ice-drainage pathways across the shelf which were formerly occupied by ice streams. At the shelf edge, a thick wedge of glacigenic sediment forms a transition from the <b>till</b> <b>sheets</b> and moraines of the shelf to debris flows composed of glacigenic sediments on the upper slope. Shelf-edge moraines show an architecture indicating floating ice in modern water depths over approximately 180 m, suggesting the West Shetland ice sheet was no more than about 250 m thick. The upper and middle slope is dominated by glacigenic debris flows which are focused in the slope areas below the proposed ice stream discharges at the shelf edge. The mid-to-lower slope has been subjected to contour current activity which has re-worked much of the glacigenic sediment in this position. The lower slope and floor of the Faroe-Shetland Channel are marked by either large debris flow lobes of glacigenic sediment or thin glacimarine muds deposited from suspension. A conceptual model of the glacigenic development of a passive {{continental margin}} based upon the West Shetland example shows the deposited sequence for both advance and retreat phases of a glacial cycle, and the actual preserved sequence which might be expected in the rock record. The model also shows that ice sheet buoyancy, thickness, and to a lesser extent, basin subsidence, are the most important factors in the deposition and preservation of a glacially-influenced marine sequence...|$|R

The till surface, which is often fluted, consists ofsix different till sheets. It lies present glacial margin and the bulky terminal moraine ridges. These till sheets correspond to six re-advance stages during the general retreat which followed Little Ice Age ad- vance which formed the bulky terminal moraine ridges. Field observations and till fabric analysis suggest that the minor moraine ridges of Yala Glacier seem to be formed annually, by ice push. On the assumption that their annual character was maintained for a long time, and that the time span needed for each re-advance was proportional to the height of terminal moraine of each <b>till</b> <b>sheet,</b> the dating of Little fee Age moraines was attempted.

40|$|Cores {{of coastal}} drumlins in Connemara contain {{stratified}} diamictons that interdigitate with gravelly clinoforms and finer grained rhythmites. The diamictons are interpreted as subaqueous mud apron deposits delivered by subglacial till advection to continuously failing subaqueous ice-contact fans, whose strata were being syn-depositionally over-steepened by glacitectonic deformation. The localized {{nature of the}} stratified sediments reflects the emergence of subglacial deforming tills and meltwater deposits in a glacilacustrine environment to produce interdigitated mass flow diamictons and grounding line fans/wedges. These depo-centres became glacitectonized and subglacially streamlined during glacier overriding and hence regional drumlin sedimentology reflects the varying degrees of inheritance of pre-existing glacigenic deposits and suggests that drumlin production relates more {{to the position of}} localized sediment accumulations at the glacier bed than full-depth till deformation processes (e. g. instability mechanisms) within the same drumlin field. Till cored drumlins give way down ice to stratified cored drumlins with till caps and then to stratified drumlins. This zonation is compatible with the increased lateral variability in drumlin composition that would arise from the occurrence of linear assemblages of glacifluvial (esker) and subaqueous (grounding line) sediments in an otherwise marginal-thickening <b>till</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{recurrence}} of drought in western Iowa, water users have increasingly {{been looking for}} additional sources of water. Buried sand and gravel aquifers associated with three bedrock channels were investigated as potential sources. Due to low data density, two primary study areas were chosen {{for a more detailed}} analysis. Point coverage was not sufficient to generate isopach maps or perform statistical analysis, but the production of cross-sections aided in the understanding of the sand and gravel bodies. Valley fills, where present, are likely to be laterally continuous, but not all valleys will have a significant thickness of sand and gravel. Sand sheets also have the potential to be laterally continuous, but their margins will not be as predictable as a valley fill since they are not bounded by a valley wall. This study demonstrates the complexity of glacial till sequences and predicting the presence of sand and gravel bodies within or between <b>till</b> <b>sheets.</b> On a local (community or township) scale, it appears that general trends can be established if the data density is sufficient. However, there is less confidence in using this data as a predictive tool on a regional scale. Several areas, such as the Glenwood Chute, have thick and continuous sand and gravel bodies. In many other areas, the data is not sufficient to map the sand and gravel. In many cases, one or two highly productive wells are identified, but their lateral distribution cannot be established.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} spatial and temporal aspects of agricultural change in southern Derbyshire between 1770 and 1870. During this period {{it is argued that}} the progress of dairying showed strong continuity with the developments of preceding centuries and experienced growth ahead of the reorientation towards liquid milk production in the latter nineteenth century. Contemporary and modern sources have been consulted, important among which are sale advertisements and other agricultural reportage published in the Derby Mercury newspaper. A significant outcome has been the elaboration of the prime role of dairying and the production of farmhouse cheese in the southern Derbyshire farm system with cattle and pig fattening, sheep rearing and grain production as subsidiary enterprises. Dairying was most intensively developed on heavier land: marls of the Mercian Mudstone, shales of the Westphalian and glacial <b>till</b> <b>sheets</b> but less so to the south of the Trent where soil conditions are more varied. Between 1770 and 1870 dairy production increased substantially as the proportion of land in arable declined. Contributory factors discussed include farm enlargement, higher stock rates and improved cattle breed. Of particular note was the feeding of brewers' grains from Burton. It is argued that as a consequence pastures may have been sustained above the common low level of management characteristic of the times. The dairy system emerges as a progressive feature of clayland sector agriculture and while not generally 'revolutionary' some farmers achieved a degree of refinement to match the concept of ‘High Farming’...|$|R
40|$|The Chalk is {{the major}} aquifer in the UK. Parts of the Chalk are covered in places by glacial drift deposits, which can have a {{significant}} influence on recharge and contaminant movement, particularly where dominated by low-permeability lithologies such as the boulder clay (<b>Till)</b> <b>sheet</b> of East Anglia. Fracturing in Till has been widely observed and its potential for providing a route for rapid contaminant movement identified. A groundwater sampling programme has been undertaken and two cored boreholes drilled to investigate the degree of attenuation effected by the Till cover.

Groundwaters beneath the valley and Till edge have a component of modern water and generally high nitrate concentrations. Evidence for denitrification is also found. Data from gas samplers shows modern air deep in the unsaturated zone suggesting a by-pass route for recharge.

40|$|Marine {{geological}} {{evidence supports}} rapid retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet {{in the eastern}} Ross Sea before the last glacial maximum. As the only accessible marine record of a major drainage outlet of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), this central and eastern Ross Sea dataset provides {{a unique opportunity to}} test the hypothesis of WAIS instability, assess its regulating role in eustasy, and explore the geological record of paleo-ice stream behavior. As the last vast marine-based ice sheet on the planet, the WAIS is seen as a key source of potentially rapid sea level rise. The collapse and disintegration of the WAIS would raise sea level by 5 [...] 6 m, a major threat to the world's coastal cities. Marine geological data were collected along the axis of large bathymetric troughs during a 1999 cruise of the R/V Nathanial B. Palmer. Thick <b>till</b> <b>sheets,</b> extensive lineations, and multiple grounding zone wedges imaged on seismic profiles and multibeam bathymetric records, indicate that troughs in the Ross Sea were occupied by paleo-ice streams during the last glacial maximum. Ice stream boundaries in the eastern Ross Sea are characterized by laterally accreting sedimentary strata indicating lateral migration of ice streams. The abrupt transition from lineated to non-lineated morphologies reflects sharp ice stream margins. Sediment cores recovered glacial-marine deposits overlying till, a facies succession that indicates an abrupt transition from subglacial to open marine deposition. High concentrations of ice rafted debris in the glacial-marine units and iceberg furrows suggest mass wasting of the ice sheet and iceberg calving from the grounding line during retreat. Corrected radiocarbon ages of samples taken above the contact between subglacial (till) and glacial-marine sediments range from 23. 4 to 26. 0 ka. B. P., indicating pre-LGM ice sheet withdrawal in the eastern Ross Sea. This was long before the ice sheet retreated from the western Ross Sea and is inconsistent with previous models for ice sheet retreat in the region...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{introduce}} the architecture {{and style of}} sedimentation of two outwash fans {{in front of the}} Myrdalsjokull ice cap, central south Iceland, that broaden different types of ice-marginal sedimentation. At Kotlujokull, a southeastern outlet of the ice cap, fan formation was monitored from the late 1970 s to 2002; thus, the style of sedimentation is well understood and the relationship to the depositional architecture easily established. In front of Slettjokull, a northern lobate extension of the ice cap, a fan from the 10 th century AD is capped by neoglacial <b>till</b> <b>sheets.</b> At both sites, the fan surfaces were reconstructed in three dimensions. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) provided the thickness and internal structure of sediment bodies. Geological exposures and excavations were used for detailed sedimentological documentation of the outwash deposits in proximal-to-distal transects. The outwash deposits at both Kotlujokull and Slettjokull are considered to be alluvial fans of the hochsander type, i. e., supraglacially fed, as they show all the architectural characteristics of alluvial fans with a semiconical shape, a restricted radial length of ca. 0. 5 - 1. 5 km, a plano-convex cross-profile and a slope gradient ranging between 1 and 5. Fan deposits are dominated by planar or low-angle cross-bedded sand facies interbedded with thin laminae of fine gravel occasionally draped by mud. Sedimentation occurs during upper flow regime sheetflows associated with antidune migration within an aggrading, shallow braided-stream network. Hochsanders are intimately linked to advancing or stationary glaciers with steep ice-cored frontal slopes that favor supraglacial over subglacial drainage. Most important, hochsander fans lack any proximal-to-distal transition in the grain-size distribution, sediment facies or facies associations. Because much classification of glacial outwash sediments is based on proximal-to-distal distinctions, it is crucial to consider the depositional model for hochsanders. This study also indicates a strong dependence between the altitudes of the buried fan surface and the present-day terrain in the forefield of Slettjokull, illustrating that subsequent to fan formation, subglacial landforms merely mask many of the pre-existing morphological features...|$|R

Specifically, the occurrence and emplacement of these heterogeneous deposits, informally referred to as the Glasford deglacial unit, into and overlying the Vandalia Member till, may impact the integrity of this extensive till aquitard, and possibly influence groundwater flow to the deeper and regionally important Mahomet aquifer. Thus, the purpose of this research is to improve knowledge of the heterogeneous character of the Glasford deglacial sediments and their three-dimensional (3 -D) hydrostratigraphic architecture. The methodology to study the Glasford deglacial unit relies on the detailed analysis of 7 continuous cores and interpretations of 4 geophysical profiles, which provide key stratigraphic control to estimate unit geometry and establish the vertical succession of facies assemblages in the unit. A 3 -D geological model was created using gOcad®, a geomodelling software, across a 2642 square kilometer study area and the deglacial unit having a subsurface volume domain of 5. 70 E+ 9 cubic meters. Utilizing all available data sources including 38 continuous cores, 69 downhole geophysical logs, 799 driller’s logs, and 4 near-surface geophysical profiles; triangulated surfaces were interpolated representing the top and bottom of the Glasford deglacial unit and key internal layers. These surfaces provided a framework for a 3 -D cellular partition, where descretizing the model allowed for mapping of hydrofacies assemblages that represented mappable heterogeneities of coarse- and fine-grained sediment in the Glasford deglacial unit. Results of the subsurface facies analysis led to the identification of three main facies types that form the Glasford deglacial unit: 1) massive, matrix-supported diamicton; 2) interstratified sand and gravel; and 3) fine-grained massive and/or bedded sediment. Using key seismic reflectors and interpretations based on near-surface seismic profiles as well as geologic logs from numerous boreholes, these facies were assigned to two features of possible regional extent: 1) a broad channelized erosion surface informally named the Champaign valley; and 2) an extensive tabular unit overlying the valley fill and extending across the entire study area. Grouping of facies into distinct facies assemblages was useful to distinguish sediments that in-fill either the Champaign valley or compose the tabular unit. Major heterogeneities have been recognized in these features and mapped at regional scale represented by fine- and coarse-grained sediment assemblages that comprise 46 % and 54 % respectively of the Glasford deglacial unit volume. Laterally continuous coarse-grained sediment assemblages are primarily located in the Champaign valley and potentially represent local aquifers of limited but usefully productivity for east-central Illinois. These small aquifers are characterized by hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1. 07 E- 3 m/s to 1. 78 E- 6 m/s. Fine-grained sediment assemblages have an average hydraulic conductivity value of 4. 38 E- 8 m/s and thus may represent discontinuous aquitards impeding water flow. However, these fine-grained sediment assemblages cannot be considered homogeneous aquitards because of their textural variability and limited lateral continuity. The geological model developed in this study contributes to better understanding the complex subsurface geology in east-central Illinois. Results of this study confirm the high degree of heterogeneity in the Glasford deglacial unit that includes features of glacial erosion, and these findings question, at least locally, the integrity of the underlying Vandalia Member till as a regional aquitard unit. Overall, the Glasford deglacial unit is a complex subsurface ice-marginal package of sediments, which challenges the aquifer-aquitard concept. It is argued herein that some ice-contact or ice-marginal sediments units may be laterally extensive as a whole, yet internally too heterogeneous to be mapped as an aquifer or aquitard at a regional scale. A new conceptual hydrostratigraphic layer, the hybrid layer (part-aquifer/ part-aquitard), is thus proposed to better describe these units. This new hybrid layer is meant to augment the traditional aquifer/aquitard concept representing hydrostratigraphic bodies that may not form laterally extensive aquifer or aquitard units. These hybrid layers may better represent conceptually the complex ice-marginal deposits that are found across east-central Illinois, and perhaps other similar areas affected by glacial lobe fluctuations during multiple glaciations...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} glacial maximum (LGM), some 20 ka ago, {{northern}} Manitoba was situated beneath 3 to 4. 5 km of ice, {{on the outer}} fringe of a major ice spreading center of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The region has also been affected by major paleoglaciological changes linked to multiple source areas, migration of ice centres, and ice-sheet thickening/thinning over multiple glacial cycles. The net effect of this evolution {{is a very complex}} geological record, which has major implications for ice-sheet reconstructions and drift prospecting. Theory-based hypothesis for the region suggest initial advance-phase deposition was followed by either net-erosive or cold-based conditions for much of the glacial cycle. In contrast, observation-based reconstructions of ice-sheet behaviour consider the glacial landscape to have been predominately formed by near-complete overprinting during warm-based deglaciation. Some complexity has been recognized in sediment-landform records, but new insights into glacial dynamics and sediment-landscape evolution are needed. Systematic mapping (remote-sensing) and fieldwork (ice-flow indicators, till composition, ground truthing) in northeastern Manitoba has led to the recognition of spatio-temporal variability in landscape (streamlined-landform event-flowsets) and landform (micro and meso-scale ice-flow indicator records) and till composition inheritance. In particular, analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the subglacial landscape led to the recognition of disjoint zones with internally-consistent assembly histories – termed glacial terrain zones (GTZ). These GTZ were then classified as (1) relict-glacial, (2) palimpsest, or (3) deglacial in nature. Generally, (1) is interpreted as pre-LGM, (2) may include pre-LGM terrain but also LGM to early deglaciation (ice margin still far from study area; ice sheet thinning phase) and (3) was formed during the final ice retreat phase. The resultant surface till composition within relict and palimpsest GTZs is a spatial mosaic interpreted to reflect variable intensities in modification (overprinting) and preservation (inheritance) of a predominately pre-deglacial <b>till</b> <b>sheet.</b> In these regions, streamlined landforms parallel to a known deglacial ice-flow orientation were unable to overprint the underlying inherited glacial sediment composition. Secondly, field investigations (sedimentology, clast fabrics, till composition, near-surface S-wave seismic surveys) have characterized the widespread Rogen moraine terrain. These transverse subglacial ridges are spatially associated with streamlined landforms, are situated on regionally low-lying terrain without topographic constraints and may have small bedrock ‘knob’ obstacles at their up-ice base. This thesis assesses Rogen moraine formation hypotheses within the new paleoglaciologic context of northern Manitoba, favours an instability mechanism for formation, and provides important field data against which further formation hypothesis should be tested. The main insight of this study is not a detailed reconstruction (local history), but rather a series of forms of evidence suggesting that the glacial history of the region is one of prevailing patchy low-erosion conditions which favored preservation of a fragmentary record of non-coeval and sometimes contrasting warm-based (more dynamic) conditions. Despite being near a thick inner-core region of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, where basal conditions are generally considered stable and meltwater availability is low, the hard-bed study area was subject to local spatio-temporal shifts in subglacial conditions that led to generation of a complex palimpsest glacial landscape. Spatial differences in the preservation of older streamlined landforms, variably drumlinized Rogen moraine and the concentrations of inherited subglacial detritus all culminate in a hypothesis that suggests the subglacial landscape was continually evolving and subject to spatio-temporal variations in the intensity of ice-bed processes throughout the last glaciation (subglacial bed mosaic). Based on the new glacial history, and a general lack of ice-marginal landsystems, most warm-based ice-flow phases likely occurred near LGM – with only weak overprinting during late deglaciation. The idea of landform generation at patches within a transient subglacial bed mosaic now allows for a close association between subglacial drumlins and Rogen moraine ridges, that may have formed by disconnected and not necessarily coeval or related processes. This mosaic, of slow to non-flowing basal ice (‘sticky regions’) and wet-based flowing-ice patches, also helps to explain preservation of immature landforms (Rogen moraine) and relict or palimpsest terrain. Sticky regions may have formed by at least two different mechanisms: localized heterogeneous switches in basal thermal regime (frozen-bed patches), or within a warm-based subglacial environment from wet to stiff, dewatered till...|$|E
50|$|The larger part of Norfolk's bedrock geology is {{concealed}} beneath superficial deposits, {{the oldest}} {{of which is a}} spread of glacial till dating from the Anglian glaciation. Interspersed with the <b>till</b> are <b>sheets</b> of glacial sands and gravels. The fact that the Chalk scarp in East Anglia is much reduced in height compared to its outcrop in Lincolnshire and the Chiltern Hills has been put down to erosion by the Anglian icesheet which reached as far south as Essex. The late Devensian glaciation resulted in the North Sea icesheet impinging upon the north coast of Norfolk. Of more recent origin are alluvial deposits which extend across the floors of the main river valleys and widely across the flats of the Broads. Coastal alluvium is also present along the north coast from Holme-next-the-Sea to Brancaster. River terrace deposits occur in places, for example around the valley of the River Waveney. Blown sand characterises the lower sections of coast. Peat is widespread in the fenland areas south and west of Downham Market.|$|R

50|$|In {{at least}} one species of skink in the large genus Trachylepis, placental {{transport}} accounts for {{nearly all of the}} provisioning of nutrients to the embryos before birth. In the uterus, the eggs are very small, about 1mm in diameter, with very little yolk and very thin shells. The shell membrane is vestigial and transient; its disintegration permits the absorption of nutrients from uterine secretions. The embryo then produces invasive chorionic tissues that grow between the cells of the uterine lining till they can absorb nutrients from maternal blood vessels. As it penetrates the lining, the embryonic tissue grows aggressively <b>till</b> it forms <b>sheets</b> of tissue beneath the uterine epithelium. They eventually strip it away and replace it, making direct contact with maternal capillaries. In several respects, the phenomenon is of considerable importance in theoretical zoology.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{results on}} the morphometry and spatial distribution of the glaciogenic landforms and ice flow directions in the Madliena Tilted Plain that occupies {{the eastern part of}} the Central Latvian Lowland. Landforms were investigated by usingtopographic maps at scales of 1 : 25 000 and 1 : 10 000. There were identified and mapped 1461 glaciogenic landforms such as drumlins, end moraine ridges, eskers, ribbed moraines, marginal ridges, lateral shear margin moraines and recessional formations. Particular attention is given to the morphometry, spatial distribution, and the internal structure of drumlins. Glacial landscape of the study area was formed by the Zemgale ice lobe in course of deglaciation of the Late Weichselian Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, when the ice decay was interrupted by the reactivation of the Middle Lithuanian and the NorthLithuanian glacial phases at the end of the Oldest Dryas (18 – 15 ka BP). The detailed study of the internal structure of the Brenceni drumlin suggests that it consists of glaciotectonically disturbed glacio-aquatic sediments and of a single <b>till</b> thrust <b>sheet</b> between sand sediments on the flank of the drumlin. Morphometric analysis of the drumlin field shows that the mean length of drumlins is about 850 m; the mean width indicates the average size 280 m, and the mean elongation ratio is 3. 0. The obtained statistics compared to the morphometry of drumlins worldwide, show close similarity, so it coincides with the concept that in general morphometry of drumlins is mostly independent of their location and the characteristics of the ice streams...|$|R
60|$|One {{feature of}} the Norman temple he could keep; for it was copied from the same Nature which {{he was trying to}} copy--namely, the high- pitched roof and gables. Mr. Ruskin lays it down as a law, that the acute angle in roofs, gables, spires, is the {{distinguishing}} mark of northern Gothic. It was adopted, most probably, at first from domestic buildings. A northern house or barn must have a high- pitched roof, or the snow will not slip off it. But that fact was not discovered by man; it was copied by him from the rocks around. He saw the mountain-peak jut black and bare above the snows of winter; he saw those snows slip down in sheets, rush down in torrents under the sun, from the steep slabs of rock which coped the hillside; and he copied, in his roofs, the rocks above his town. But as the love for decorations arose, he would deck his roofs as nature had decked hers, <b>till</b> the gray <b>sheets</b> of the cathedral slates should stand out amid pinnacles and turrets rich with foliage, as the gray mountain-sides stood out amid knolls of feathery birch and towering pine.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogemorphic {{linkages}} {{related to}} sediment transport in headwater streams following basin wide clear-cut logging on Prince of Wales Island, southeast Alaska, were investigated. Landslides and debris flows transported sediment and woody debris in headwater tributaries in 1961, 1979, and 1993. Widespread landsliding in 1961 and 1993 {{was triggered by}} rainstorms with recurrence intervals (24 h precipitation) of 7. 0 years and 4. 2 years respectively. Occurrence, distribution, and downstream effects of these mass movements were controlled by landform characteristics such as channel gradient and valley configuration. Landslides and channelized debris flows created exposed bedrock reaches, log jams, fans, and abandoned channels. The terminus of the deposits did not enter main channels because debris flows spread and thinned on the unconfined bottom of the U-shaped glaciated valley. Chronic sediment input to channels included surface erosion of exposed <b>till</b> (rain splash, <b>sheet</b> erosion, and freeze - thaw action) and bank failures. Bedload sediment transport in a channel impacted by 1993 landslides and debris flows was two to ten times greater and relatively finer compared with bedload transport in a young alder riparian channel that had last experienced a landslide and debris flow in 1961. Sediment transport and storage were influenced by regeneration of riparian vegetation, storage behind recruited woody debris, development of a streambed armour layer, and the decoupling of hillslopes and channels. Both spatial and temporal variations of sediment movement and riparian condition are important factors in understanding material transport within headwaters and through channel networks. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R
