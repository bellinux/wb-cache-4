2500|$|... "Alive" [...] {{has been}} {{revealed}} by Vedder {{to be part}} autobiographical and part fiction. When Vedder was a teenager, his mother revealed {{to him that the}} man he thought was his father was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was dead. The first and last verses detail those actual events, but the second verse is storytelling on Vedder's part. The lyrics of the second verse read, [...] "Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room/She said I'm ready...for you/I can't remember anything to this very day/'Cept the look, the look.../Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare...," [...] and Vedder revealed that [...] "she" [...] was the mother, and [...] "the look" [...] referred to was not <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, but [...] "the look is between her legs. Where do you go with that? That's where you came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} {{concluded that}} [...] "the secretly devastating video" [...] for [...] "Someone like You" [...] will remind Adele's ex-lover {{what he has}} done by leaving her. A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video. Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an [...] "uncomplicated, moving film" [...] and wrote, [...] "the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its grey skies, singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more." [...] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was [...] "simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, [...] "speak for itself" [...] about the sadness in the video. Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, [...] "the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. <b>The</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur is {{in a cell}} in {{the town}} prison, and Hook wants to know who Nimue is and what he’s hiding, but Arthur says that Emma took his {{memories}} so he doesn't know anything. David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined {{to find out what}} went on in Camelot, saying {{that the only way to}} help her is to find out what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says he recognizes <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E

60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>the</b> father <b>looked</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{steadily}} as she approached, {{and in that}} instant his determination was formed. A flight of steps at his feet led to the narrow doorway of a small temple, the nearest building to him.|$|R
