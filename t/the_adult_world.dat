In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how they view <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

500|$|Kevin Steinberger, {{reviewer}} for Magpies, found Lat's layout made Kampung Boy an [...] "easy, inviting read." [...] He {{said that}} Lat's pen-and-ink drawings {{relied on the}} [...] "strong contrast {{between black and white}} to create space and suggest substance." [...] Lat drew the children of Kampung Boy as [...] "mostly mop-topped, toothy, bare-bottomed or sarong-draped" [...] kids, who are often [...] "exaggeratedly dwarfed" [...] by items of <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b> [...] He explained that the way the boys were drawn was partly due to the influence of comics he read in the 1950s; [...] "naughty ones with... bushy hair" [...] were prominent male protagonists in those books. [...] The adult characters are easily distinguished by their exaggerated clothing and accessories such as puffed out pants and butterfly glasses. [...] "Short and round" [...] shapes make the design of the characters distinctive. [...] These characters display exaggerated expressions, particularly when they are drawn to face the readers.|$|E
500|$|As McPherson stated, [...] "The {{journey to}} a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which {{involves}} the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography." [...] For Angelou, this quest took her from her childhood and adolescence, as described in her first two books, into <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b> [...] The setting in Angelou's first two autobiographies was limited to three places (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), but the [...] "setting breaks open" [...] in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas to include Europe as she traveled with her Porgy and Bess company. [...] McPherson saw Angelou's third autobiography as [...] "a sunny tour of Angelou's twenties", from early years marked by disappointments and humiliation, into the broader world—to the white world and to the international community. This period described [...] "years of joy", {{as well as the}} start of Angelou's great success and fulfillment as an entertainer. [...] Lupton stated that Angelou's travel narrative in Singin' and Swingin', which took up approximately 40 percent of the book, gave the book its organized structure. Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class made the book more than a simple travel narrative. As a Black American, her travels around the world put her in contact with many nationalities and classes, expanded her experiences beyond her familiar circle of community and family, and complicated her understandings of race relations.|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Christopher Connelly called Thriller [...] "a zesty LP" [...] with a [...] "harrowing, dark message". He compared {{the songs on}} the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since Off the Wall, while observing that he [...] "dropped the boyish falsetto" [...] and was facing his [...] "challenges head-on" [...] with [...] "a feisty determination" [...] and [...] "a full, adult voice". John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times that perhaps Jackson was a [...] "sometimes too practiced ... performer", that at times Quincy Jones may [...] "depersonalize his individuality" [...] with his [...] "slightly anonymous production", and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind [...] "layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils". He nonetheless deemed Thriller [...] "a wonderful pop record, the latest statement {{by one of the}} great singers in popular music today" [...] and that there are [...] "hits here, too, lots of them". Rockwell believed it helped breach [...] "the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music", especially as [...] "white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to pretend he isn't black after all". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it's almost classic anyway". He later wrote in retrospect, [...] "what we couldn't know is how brilliantly every hit but 'P.Y.T.' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure." [...] A year after the album's release, Time summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, [...] "The pulse of America and {{much of the rest of}} the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'." [...] In 1989, Toronto Star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of [...] "commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit." [...] Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his [...] "master work" [...] and that [...] "commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on Thriller, and that's a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>world,</b> a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection".|$|E

2500|$|Smoking, {{primarily}} of tobacco, is {{an activity that}} is practiced by some 1.1billion people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population. The image of the smoker can vary considerably, but is very often associated, especially in fiction, with individuality and aloofness. Even so, smoking of both tobacco and cannabis can be a social activity {{which serves as a}} reinforcement of social structures and is part of the cultural rituals of many and diverse social and ethnic groups. Many smokers begin smoking in social settings and the offering and sharing of a cigarette is often an important rite of initiation or simply a good excuse to start a conversation with strangers in many settings; in bars, night clubs, at work or on the street. Lighting a cigarette is often seen as an effective way of avoiding the appearance of idleness or mere loitering. For adolescents, it can function as a first step out of childhood or as an act of rebellion against <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b> Also, smoking {{can be seen as a}} sort of camaraderie. It has been shown that even opening a packet of cigarettes, or offering a cigarette to other people, can increase the level of dopamine (the [...] "happy feeling") in the brain, and it is doubtless that people who smoke form relationships with fellow smokers, in a way that only proliferates the habit, particularly in countries where smoking inside public places has been made illegal. Other than recreational drug use, it can be used to construct identity and a development of self-image by associating it with personal experiences connected with smoking. The rise of the modern anti-smoking movement in the late 19th century did more than create awareness of the hazards of smoking; it provoked reactions of smokers against what was, and often still is, perceived as an assault on personal freedom and has created an identity among smokers as rebels or outcasts, apart from non-smokers: ...|$|E

6000|$|Directly we let our {{thoughts}} pass {{out of this}} physical plane and rise so high as to consider the concurrent emotions--and I suppose to {{a large number of}} people these are at least as important as the physical aspects--we come to pride, we come to preference and jealousy, and so soon as we bring these to bear upon our physical scheme, crumpling and fissures begin. The complications have multiplied enormously. More especially that little trouble of preferences. These emotions we may educate indeed, but not altogether. Neither pride nor preference nor jealousy are to be tampered with lightly. We are making men, we are not planning a society of regulated slaves; we want fine upstanding personalities, and we shall not get them if we break them down to obedience in this particular--for the cardinal expression of freedom in the human life is surely this choice of a mate. There is indeed no freedom without this freedom. Our men and women in the future must feel free and responsible. It seems almost instinctive, at least in the youth of the white races, to exercise this power of choice, not simply rebelling when opposition is offered to it, but wanting to rebel; it is a socially good thing, and a thing we are justified in protecting if the odds are against it, this passion for making the business one's very own private affair. Our citizens must not be caught and paired; it will never work like that. But in all social contrivances we must see to it that the freedoms we give are real freedoms. Our youths and maidens as they grow up out of the protection of our first taboos, grow into a world very largely in the hands of older people; strong men and experienced women are there before them, and we are justified in any effectual contrivance to save them from being [...] "gobbled up"--against their real instincts. That works--the reflective man will discover--towards whittling the previous polygamy to still smaller proportions. Here, indeed, our present arrangements fail most lamentably; each year sees a hideous sacrifice of girls, mentally scarcely more than children--to our delicacy in discussion. We give freedom, and we do not give adequate knowledge, and we punish inexorably. There are a multitude of women, and not a few men, with lives hopelessly damaged by this blindfold freedom. So many poor girls, so many lads also, do not get a fair chance against <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>world.</b> Things mend indeed in this respect; as one sign the percentage of illegitimate births in England has almost halved in fifty years, but it is clear we have much to revise before this leakage to perdition of unlucky creatures, for the most part girls no worse on the average, I honestly believe--until our penalties make them so--than other women, ceases. If our age of moral responsibility is high enough, then our age of complete knowledge is too high. But nevertheless, things are better than they were, and promise still to mend. All round we raise the age, the average age at marriage rises, just as, I believe, the average age at misconduct has risen. We may not be approaching a period of universal morality, but we do seem within sight of a time when people will know what they are doing.|$|E
