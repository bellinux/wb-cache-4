5|$|Since yttrium is {{chemically}} {{so similar}} to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (rare-earth minerals) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not perfect. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The Draped Bust {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1795 to 1803, and was reproduced, dated 1804, into the 1850s. The design succeeded the Flowing Hair dollar, which began mintage in 1794 {{and was the}} first silver dollar struck by the United States Mint. The {{designer}} is unknown, though <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> usually credited to artist Gilbert Stuart. The model is also unknown, though Ann Willing Bingham has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E

5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. <b>The</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E
5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. <b>The</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

Parker & Co. bought the rights to the Ives games. The republication claimed The Mansion of Happiness was the first board game published in the United States of America; today, however, <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> awarded to Lockwood's Traveller's Tour games of 1822. The popularity of The Mansion of Happiness and similar moralistic board games was challenged in the last decades of the 19th century when the focus of games became materialistic and competitive capitalistic behavior.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from this}} {{immediate}} effect, the case represented a clear {{recognition that the}} Australia Act 1986 finally and completely ended all legal ties between the United Kingdom and Australia, and that Australia has been a fully independent and sovereign nation {{in its own right}} since at least 3 March 1986, when the Act came into force. Some commentators have criticised the evolutionary approach adopted by the court, and the court's resultant failure to find a certain date on which Australia became independent, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> more than merely symbolic and could have real consequences. However, even Justice Callinan, who questioned the evolutionary approach in this case, affirmed in a later case (Attorney-General Western Australia v Marquet) that the effect of the Australia Act in finally recognising independence could not be doubted.|$|E

However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while <b>the</b> various <b>distinctions</b> may overlap, <b>the</b> notions are clearly not identical: the a priori/a posteriori <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> epistemological, <b>the</b> analytic/synthetic <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> linguistic, and <b>the</b> necessary/contingent <b>distinction</b> <b>is</b> metaphysical.|$|R

In the first half of the seventeenth century, thou disappeared from Standard English, although <b>the</b> T-V <b>distinction</b> <b>was</b> preserved in many regional dialects.
