5000|$|A class-4, or tandem, {{telephone}} switch is a U.S. <b>telephone</b> company <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange used {{to interconnect}} local exchange carrier offices for long distance communications {{in the public}} switched telephone network.|$|R
50|$|Development {{and use of}} {{the blue}} box was largely enabled by Bell Telephone's policy of {{publishing}} all technical documentation regarding its equipment. In response to the development of this and other means of telephone hacking, the company began to develop other means of securing its system, without publicly disclosing the details. These included modifying <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> to listen for the 2600 Hz tone coming from a subscriber telephone. This, plus the investigation and prosecution of several hackers by the FBI, led to a decrease in phone phreaking and displaced much of the remaining activity to coin phones.|$|R
50|$|The line {{cards in}} a <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> switch that are {{interfaced}} to analog lines include hybrids that adapt the four-wire network to the two-wire circuits that connect most subscribers.|$|E
5000|$|Early in {{its history}} Codell had a school, {{multiple}} churches and a business district with a bank, <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> lumber yard, grain elevator, several stores, a doctor and a barber.|$|E
5000|$|Customers {{who wanted}} a {{telephone}} number provided by a neighbouring <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> leased a [...] "foreign exchange" [...] line. With the old two-wire loop technology, this would require an engineered circuit with increased costs. The practice, rare except in big cities, is in decline.|$|E
50|$|Both {{integrated}} and isolated bonding networks as per Telcordia GR-295, Mesh and Isolated Bonding Networks: Definition and Application to <b>Telephone</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Offices,</b> are a technically viable means to ground and bond the equipment {{in a safe}} and effective manner. However, the integrated or mesh bonding schemes are preferred over isolated bonding networks because of the added costs and efforts required to manage, control, and maintain the isolation for the equipment, particularly during equipment upgrade and modifications to the plant. This preference {{is based on a}} pragmatic desire for lower costs and ease of management, and to simplify operations during plant modifications/upgrades.|$|R
50|$|Automated Main Distribution Frame (AMDF), (automated {{switching}} matrix, automated distribution frame, Loop Management System (LMS)), {{a technology}} to provide connectivity between subscriber (local loop, outside plant) - and office equipment (inside plant) lines in a <b>telephone</b> exchange (<b>central</b> <b>office,</b> CO) {{main distribution frame}} (MDF).|$|R
50|$|Cardas {{worked for}} General Telephone (Verizon) in the 1960s doing <b>telephone</b> installation, <b>central</b> <b>office</b> {{maintenance}} and transmission line design. In 1969, {{he left to}} pursue a career in racing. Over the next few years he had many inventions relating to engine design and automotive racing fuels.|$|R

50|$|This {{movie is}} noted for the {{physical}} tracing of the call to find Inga (Bancroft) before she dies. Throughout the movie, the call is traced by hand through several electro-mechanical <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> switches {{which leads to the}} hotel where Inga was staying (originally the Hyatt House, now demolished) near the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{interface}} standards between analog <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> equipment and customer-premises equipment. Single voice paths generally include analog audio connections, either a two-wire circuit or four-wire circuit plus signaling paths to indicate call progress and status information, such as ringing, answer supervision, etc. Some {{of the known}} interface types are ...|$|E
50|$|A Class-5 {{telephone}} switch is {{a telephone}} switch or telephone exchange {{in the public}} switched telephone network located at the local <b>telephone</b> company's <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> directly serving subscribers. Class-5 switch services include basic dial-tone, calling features, and additional digital and data services to subscribers connected to a local loop.|$|R
50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>office</b> {{multiplexing}} (or CO muxing) is <b>telephone</b> exchange (<b>central</b> <b>office)</b> {{equipment that}} derives {{a number of}} lower speed channels from one high-bandwidth channel. This type of multiplexing is needed when the customer wants to terminate the DS1 or DS3 in the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and wants to ‘pick up’ lower level services. For example, a customer may order a DS3, using it to carry a number of DS1 level services from different IXC carriers.|$|R
50|$|Hull has {{therefore}} {{remained an}} exception within the UK telephone network, {{being the only}} place in the UK not served by BT and is noted for its distinctive cream coloured telephone boxes and innovative services, for example becoming the UK's first fully digital network in 1989, using Marconi System X <b>telephone</b> switches (<b>Central</b> <b>Offices</b> or Class 5 switches).|$|R
50|$|A marker {{is a type}} {{of special}} purpose control system that was used in {{electromechanical}} <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> switches. Central office switches are the large devices that telephone companies use to make the connections that support telephone calls. The switch makes voice connections between users, and to control equipment such as that used to detect dialed numbers.|$|E
50|$|During {{its heyday}} Neidpath had four grain elevators, {{two of which}} still stand {{derelict}} today. At one time Neidpath even had its own telephone company, the Neidpath Rural <b>Telephone</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Office,</b> two Chinese hotels and restaurants {{as well as the}} King George Hotel along Central Avenue, a pool hall, hardware store, and a blacksmith shop. By 1981, CN had abandoned the rail line.|$|E
50|$|For example, the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) {{located at}} a <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> terminates the cables leading to {{subscribers}} {{on the one}} hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as DSLAMs and telephone switches) on the other. Service is provided to a subscriber by manually wiring a twisted pair (called a jumper wire) between the telephone line and the relevant DSL or POTS line circuit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{trunking}} (resource sharing) {{is actually quite}} old, and is taken from telephone company technology and practice. Consider two telco <b>central</b> <b>office</b> exchanges, one in town [...] "A" [...] {{and the other in}} adjacent town [...] "B". Each of these <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> has the theoretical capacity to handle ten thousand individual <b>telephone</b> numbers. (<b>Central</b> <b>office</b> [...] "A", with prefix [...] "123", has available 10,000 numbers from 123-0000 to 123-9999; <b>central</b> <b>office</b> [...] "B", with prefix [...] "124", the same.) ...|$|R
50|$|An {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} (UPS) takes its power from two or more sources simultaneously. It is usually powered directly from the AC mains, while simultaneously charging a storage battery. Should there be a dropout {{or failure of the}} mains, the battery instantly takes over so that the load never experiences an interruption. In a computer installation, this gives the operators time to shut down the system in an orderly way. Other UPS schemes may use an internal combustion engine or turbine to continuously supply power to a system in parallel with power coming from the AC. The engine-driven generators would normally be idling, but could come to full power in {{a matter of a few}} seconds in order to keep vital equipment running without interruption. Such a scheme might be found in hospitals or <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>offices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Speed dialing is also {{available}} via Custom Calling features from the <b>Telephone</b> Company's <b>Central</b> <b>Office.</b> The numbers are programmed by the subscriber through the standard telephone dial, and speed dial calls are placed by dialing simply the digit and waiting a few seconds on a standard rotary dial phone and an older 10 key Touch Tone phone, or by dialing the number and the # key to instantly connect the call on a modern 12 key Touch Tone phone.|$|R
50|$|Currently, most ADSL {{communication}} is full-duplex. Full-duplex ADSL {{communication is}} usually achieved {{on a wire}} pair by either frequency-division duplex (FDD), echo-cancelling duplex (ECD), or time-division duplex (TDD). FDD uses two separate frequency bands, {{referred to as the}} upstream and downstream bands. The upstream band is used for communication from the end user to the <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> The downstream band is used for communicating from the central office to the end user.|$|E
5000|$|The 68030 {{was used}} in many models of the Apple Macintosh II and Commodore Amiga series of {{personal}} computers, NeXT Cube, later Alpha Microsystems multiuser systems, and some descendants of the Atari ST line such as the Atari TT and the Atari Falcon. It was also used in Unix workstations such as the Sun Microsystems Sun-3x line of desktop workstations (the earlier [...] "sun3" [...] used a 68020), Laser printers and the Nortel Networks DMS-100 <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> switch. More recently, the 68030 core has also been adapted by Freescale into a microcontroller for embedded applications.|$|E
50|$|At these lower speeds, ATM {{provides}} a useful ability to carry multiple logical circuits on a single physical or virtual medium, although other techniques exist, such as Multi-link PPP and Ethernet VLANs, which are optional in VDSL implementations. DSL {{can be used as}} an access method for an ATM network, allowing a DSL termination point in a <b>telephone</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> to connect to many internet service providers across a wide-area ATM network. In the United States, at least, this has allowed DSL providers to provide DSL access to the customers of many internet service providers. Since one DSL termination point can support multiple ISPs, the economic feasibility of DSL is substantially improved.|$|E
50|$|The North American Numbering Plan allocates <b>telephone</b> {{numbers to}} <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> in blocks of 10000 {{consecutive}} numbers; each block is {{identified by the}} area code (three digits) and a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> code (three digits). The remaining four digits identify the line number within the exchange. For allocation to local service providers, these blocks are subdivided and assigned in groups of 1000.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} <b>telephone</b> {{exchanges and}} <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> became the local exchange {{points in the}} nationwide system, and each was assigned a number of three digits, which was unique in the Numbering Plan Area, but of similar form to all others. These codes served as destination routing codes for use by operators and subscribers to reach any <b>central</b> <b>office</b> through the switching network.|$|R
50|$|The {{accompanying}} {{figure is}} {{a schematic of}} a simple DSL connection (in blue). The right side shows a DSLAM residing in the <b>telephone</b> company's <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> The left side shows the customer premises equipment with an optional router. This router manages a local area network (LAN) off of which are connected some number of PCs. With many service providers, the customer may opt for a modem which contains a wireless router. This option (within the dashed bubble) often simplifies the connection.|$|R
