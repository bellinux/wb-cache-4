25|$|The system {{initially}} used Siemens-Duewag U2 DC LRVs (originally {{designed for}} German metros, {{and used by}} the Frankfurt U-Bahn. The slightly earlier Edmonton Light Rail Transit, and the slightly later San Diego Trolley were built at approximately {{the same time and}} used the same commercial off-the-shelf German LRVs rather than custom-designed vehicles such as were used on the Toronto streetcar system and the Vancouver Skytrain. U2 vehicles constituted the entire fleet in Calgary until July 2001, when the first Siemens SD-160 cars were delivered. A total of 83 of the original U2 DCs were delivered to Calgary over three separate orders; 27 in 1981, 3 in 1983, and 53 in 1984 and are numbered 2001 – 2083. Today, 80 out of the original 83 U2 DCs remain in service. The success of the first North American LRT systems inspired Siemens to build an LRV plant in Florin, California. Siemens now supplies one-third of North American LRVs and has supplied over 1000 vehicles to 17 North American systems. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>include</b> 258 vehicles for Calgary when the current order of Siemens S200 vehicles is completed.|$|E
