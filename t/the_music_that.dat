5|$|Composed by Academy Award winner Bill Conti, the Rocky Balboa film {{score is}} both an updated {{composition}} of Rocky music and a tribute to <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> has been featured in previous Rocky films. Conti, who has acted as composer on every Rocky film except Rocky IV, chose to compose the score almost entirely from musical themes used in the previous movies. Only one original theme was written specifically for Rocky Balboa {{and that is the}} theme written to represent the character of Marie.|$|E
5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it {{was not included in the}} game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula {{experiences}} rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments {{once they were}} united by Islamic culture in the seventh century. Frame drums and cylindrical drums of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music. Conical oboes were involved in <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> accompanied wedding and circumcision ceremonies. Persian miniatures provide information {{on the development of}} kettle drums in Mesopotamia that spread as far as Java. Various lutes, zithers, dulcimers, and harps spread as far as Madagascar to the south and modern-day Sulawesi to the east.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{a regular contributor to}} the music of the Final Fantasy series. Several other composers including Masayoshi Soken and Naoshi Mizuta contributed music for updates to the game. The {{music for the}} game's reboot, , was primarily composed by Soken, who was the sound director for both releases of the game. Music from both releases of the game has been released in several albums, though no album contains music from both XIV and A Realm Reborn. A pair of mini-albums containing a handful of selected tracks from XIV, Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks and Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks, were released by Square Enix in 2010 when XIV first launched. A soundtrack album titled Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers, containing most of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> had been released by that point for XIV, was digitally released in 2012. A final soundtrack album for the original release of the game, Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack, was released in 2013 just before the launch of A Realm Reborn, and contains all of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> was composed for XIV throughout its lifetime. The latest soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn Original Soundtrack, was released in 2014, and contains all of the music for A Realm Reborn released up to that point.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, {{due in large part to}} the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|E
5|$|Though Madonna {{is often}} overshadowed by her producers, {{she has her}} moments, and she is never more {{inspired}} than on the so-silly-it's-great 'Impressive Instant', yet another homage to <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> leaves her and legions of followers 'spinning, baby, out of control'. She deserves credit for allowing her latest interpretation of that music to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm to Sacramento going bonkers with her.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, {{the band}} started {{work on their}} next album, Night in the Ruts. Aerosmith decided to go on tour during {{a break in the}} {{recording}} schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to Cleveland Stadium on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival. In a heated argument backstage, Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). In leaving, Perry took some of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> he had written with him. Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called the Joe Perry Project.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E
5|$|Sullivan {{tended to}} re-use his ballet music. Of the five {{movements}} that Tillett and Spencer identified, only one (the Waltz, No. 3) {{is not known}} to have been used in any other work. Three of the movements had previously been used in L'Île Enchantée. Two of those, and one other, were eventually re-used in Victoria and Merrie England. One was also used in his incidental music to Macbeth. Sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a French-language production of The Mikado in Brussels, which he duly did. Tillett suggests that the Thespis ballet was almost certainly <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> Sullivan provided, given that it was the only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera, and that three weeks after producing The Gondoliers he is unlikely to have written something original.|$|E

50|$|Animal Rights is {{the fourth}} studio album by American {{musician}} Moby, released on September 23, 1996. The album was a temporary style shift from <b>the</b> electronica <b>music</b> <b>that</b> Moby had previously released to an alternative rock sound influenced by <b>the</b> hardcore punk <b>music</b> <b>that</b> he had enjoyed as a teenager. The album was a critical and commercial failure.|$|R
25|$|Following the Far East tour, The Clash {{returned}} to London in March 1982 {{to listen to}} <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> they had recorded in New York three months earlier. They had recorded 18 songs, enough material to possibly release as double-album. Having previously released the double-LP London Calling (1979) and the triple-LP Sandinista! (1980), the group considered whether it should again release a multi-LP collection.|$|E

Because of this, some of Martin's comedy sketches could not be heard on the podcast. Earlier sketches containing copyright music were included on the ends of later Podcasts, from #144 (29 October 2007) onwards.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Bach's {{reputation}} as a composer at first declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style. Initially, he was remembered more as a virtuoso player of the organ and as a teacher. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> had been printed during the composer's lifetime, at least the part that was remembered, was for the organ and the harpsichord. Thus, his {{reputation as}} a composer was initially mostly limited to his keyboard music, and that even fairly limited to its value in music education.|$|E

25|$|Indigenous {{music of}} North America, which {{includes}} American Indian music or Native American music, is <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> is used, created or performed by Indigenous peoples of North America, including Native Americans in the United States and Aboriginal peoples in Canada, Indigenous peoples of Mexico, and other North American countries—especially traditional tribal music. In {{addition to the}} traditional music of the Native American groups, there now exist pan-tribal and intertribal genres as well as distinct Native American subgenres of popular music including: rock, blues, hip hop, classical, film music, and reggae, as well as unique popular styles like waila ("chicken scratch").|$|E
25|$|The musical {{genre of}} Namdev's {{literary}} works {{was a form}} of Prabandha – itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual message in the words has a central role, and the structure resonates with the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units).|$|E

The Queensland Symphony Orchestra, with British violinist Jack Liebeck, performed the piece over several concerts at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre; each performance was preceded by a lecture by physicist prof. Brian Cox, who talked at length about NASA's Voyager Mission, and introduced the concerto. The 30 minutes piece, in one single movement, depicts the journey of the Voyager through the Solar System, using as references some of <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>that</b> is on board each probe, on the Golden Record.|$|E
