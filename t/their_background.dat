5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and <b>their</b> <b>background.</b> Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E
5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into <b>their</b> <b>background,</b> and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E

5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, <b>their</b> <b>background</b> as a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E
5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in <b>their</b> <b>background</b> images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E

Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin by using Floo powder through the fireplace in Umbridge's own office and learns more about his parents and <b>their</b> <b>background.</b> After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, Fred and George then leave Hogwarts to start a joke-shop in Diagon Alley.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Central {{aspects of}} {{emotional}} experiences are often well remembered {{at the expense}} of background de-tails. Previous studies of such memory trade-offs have fo-cusedonmemoryafter brief delays, but little is knownabout how these components of emotional memories change over time. We investigated the evolution of memory for negative scenes across 30 min, 12 daytime hours spent awake, and 12 nighttime hours including sleep. After 30 min, negative objects werewell remembered {{at the expense of}} information about <b>their</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Time spent awake led to forget-ting of the entire negative scene, with memories of objects and <b>their</b> <b>backgrounds</b> decaying at similar rates. Sleep, in contrast, led to a preservation of memories of negative objects, but not <b>their</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> a result suggesting that the two components undergo differential processing durin...|$|R

5|$|Like all flounders, Peacock flounders, Bothus mancus, have {{excellent}} adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration {{to avoid being}} detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match <b>their</b> <b>background.</b> In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and hormones. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.|$|E
5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches <b>their</b> <b>background</b> or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|Toriyama was {{commissioned}} {{to illustrate the}} characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with <b>their</b> <b>background</b> information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, {{as long as they}} have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for , the boats and ships. The series' Slime character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in international media coverage. Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at the Foreign Ministry held during the election weekend as it usually is. The journalists also got to ask questions to the representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and <b>their</b> <b>background.</b> The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E
