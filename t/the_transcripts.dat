Nothing is known of his activities in the six months he served with Operation Reinhard; participants were sworn to secrecy.

5|$|C-SPAN has {{published}} ten books {{based on its}} programming; these contain original material and text taken from interview transcripts. The first C-SPAN book, C-SPAN: America's Town Hall, was published in 1988. Other C-SPAN books include: Gavel to Gavel: A C-SPAN Guide to Congress; Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb?, {{a guide to the}} grave sites of U.S. presidents; Abraham Lincoln - Great American Historians On Our Sixteenth President, a collection of essays based on C-SPAN interviews with American historians; and The Supreme Court, which features biographies and interviews with past Supreme Court judges together with commentary from legal experts. Five books have been drawn from the former Booknotes program: Booknotes: Life Stories; Booknotes: On American Character; Booknotes: Stories from American History; Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on Reading, Writing and the Power of Ideas, the latter a compilation of short monologues taken from <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> of Lamb's interviews; and a companion book to the series on Tocqueville, Traveling Tocqueville's America: A Tour Book.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the air traffic control transmissions associated with the flight. <b>The</b> <b>transcripts</b> of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with air traffic control recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 air traffic control audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act. Several key minutes of the air traffic control audio {{can be found on the}} Toronto Star web site.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Senate committee inquiries was the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which in 2002 investigated {{what became known as}} the Children Overboard Affair. The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E

25|$|The {{editors of}} The Chicago Tribune, a {{newspaper}} that had supported Nixon, wrote, “He is humorless {{to the point of}} being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.” The Providence Journal wrote, “Reading <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.” This newspaper continued that, while <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in <b>the</b> <b>transcripts.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{transcription}} of chicken reticulocyte chromatin with E. coli RNA polymerase has been studied in several different ways. The amount of globin RNA sequences has been measured by hybridizing <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> with globin cDNA; we show that under the proper conditions mercurated transcript RNA can be separated from endogenous RNA on sulfhydryl affinity columns. The amount of globin RNA in <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> is approximately 20 fold greater than that from erythrocyte chromatin or reticulocyte DNA. Although these data {{could be used to}} support the hypothesis of specific transcription, we show by RNA/RNA self hybridization of <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> (which is at least 50 % symmetric) and by hybridization of <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> to unique DNA in vast RNA excess that the bulk of <b>the</b> chromatin <b>transcript</b> differs little from <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> of naked DNA. Several explanations for these apparently contradictory results are offered with the most likely one being compatible with random transcription of at least most of the sequences in the chromatin...|$|R

50|$|Roberts {{held that}} filing and serving a {{petition}} {{are not enough}} to complete a filing with {{the court of appeals}} regarding NLRB enforcement actions, and that a <b>transcript</b> of <b>the</b> Board's proceedings also must be filed.

A writ of prohibition and writ of mandamus, Roberts concluded, were appropriate remedies if the NLRB decided to withdraw its decision before it had filed <b>the</b> <b>transcript.</b>|$|R

25|$|Castellano's {{most vocal}} critic was John Gotti, a Queens-based capo and Dellacroce protégé. Gotti was ambitious {{and wanted to}} be boss himself. He was also angry that Castellano allowed the DeMeo crew to deal in {{narcotics}} while forbidding him from doing it. Gotti and his men conducted their drug trade in secret. The 1983 Ruggiero indictment came from phone conversations that Federal agents had recorded on Gotti's phone. The taped conversations included Ruggiero discussing drug deals and expressing his contempt for Castellano. By law, the defendants were allowed transcripts of these wiretap conversations to aid their defense. Castellano immediately demanded copies for himself. Dellacroce kept <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> from Castellano – the drug dealing and disrespectful language on <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> would have given Castellano cause to kill both Ruggiero and John Gotti. In turn, Dellacroce prevented Gotti from deposing Castellano, citing his promise to Carlo Gambino.|$|E
