5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
25|$|All these African {{cultures}} had musical traditions, which survive erratically to {{the present}} day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> in Lucum√≠ ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, {{and the absence of}} melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind.|$|E
2500|$|However, as {{described}} in Plato's Theaetetus, Protagoras's views allow that some views may result from an ill body or mind. He stressed that although all views may appear equally true, and perhaps, should be equally respected, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not of equal gravity. One view may be useful and advantageous {{to the person who}} has it, while the perception of another may prove harmful. Hence, Protagoras believed that the sophist was there to teach the student how to discriminate between them, i.e., to teach [...] "virtue".|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not {{the happiest}} couple present {{as they walked}} up-stairs, looking like a model husband and wife, with their name echoing from landing to landing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of [...] "only-doweried" [...] {{is close to}} pre-nuptial contracts excluding the spouse from property, though children are usually not affected by prenuptials, whereas <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> by morganatical marriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Roger, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> great days," [...] {{answered}} our hero. [...] "No {{matter what}} exciting times {{may come in}} the future, I'll never forget how I helped to capture my double." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; yesterday--Sunday. I can {{not make}} out whether they come by themselves. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not all made by incendiaries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are the negroes slaves, Mr. Atherton? They {{still have}} slavery in Brazil, do they not? <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> {{not at all}} {{according}} to my idea of slaves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not, Miss Mitford," [...] {{the mate}} laughed. [...] "I {{saw some of}} them the last time I came through here, and hideous-looking creatures they are, and wear no clothes to speak of." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "the {{children}} who have been removed as wards of the Chief Protector have been removed because I desired to be satisfied that the conditions surrounding their upbringing <b>were</b> satisfactory, which <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not." ...|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "yellow-legged" [...] party {{remained}} at Nassau. I {{was a little}} sorry for this, too, as I liked the men pretty well, now that I knew them better. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> good walkers.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not. <b>They</b> {{were of a}} pearly grey colour, small, round, {{and almost}} {{transparent}} against the light. [...] "From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water," [...] I remarked.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've {{got some}} sort of a deal on for {{handling}} horses and cattle. We couldn't make out exactly what it was," [...] answered Randy. [...] "But <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> a tough bunch. It looks to me as if they might have been drinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Politics {{are in a}} sad way everywhere, I am told. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> in England. Dear Mr. Cardew is {{ruining the}} country. I wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him. I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don't think that uneducated people {{should be allowed to}} have votes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I live," [...] thought Peter, [...] "I've {{found the}} nest of Longlegs! He and Mrs. Longlegs {{may be good}} {{fishermen}} but <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> mighty poor nest-builders. I don't see how under the sun Mrs. Longlegs ever gets on and off that nest without kicking the eggs out." ...|$|E
60|$|The Scots {{soldiers}} left by Mary of Guise {{may have}} <b>been</b> Protestants, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not Frenchmen; and, {{in a town}} where death had just been threatened to all priests who celebrated the Mass, Mary could not abandon her clerics unprotected.|$|R
50|$|A pro-Mussolini teacher called Dhiamantis who {{returned}} to Samarina during the Occupation and tried {{to set up a}} fascist Vlach state the Principality of Pindus. It is possible that the idea of autonomy struck a chord in some nationalistic Vlach breasts but <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not the collaborators he accused them of being.|$|R
50|$|The Laha technique: {{in which}} the gourd was ornately painted. Painted gourds are not {{documented}} in the earlier writings, {{but that does not}} exclude their existence. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> in use at least by the time of Hawaiian historian, Samuel Kamakau, as he defines Laha as referring specifically to gourds decorated by painting.|$|R
60|$|The {{action of}} the Government must not be considered, {{as though they were}} {{unfettered}} in their judgment; it can never be supposed that they acted as they did, because they thought such action right or even wise, for that would be to set them down as men of a very low order of intelligence, which <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|E
6000|$|... "I warned him," [...] David said, [...] "that {{they were}} entirely a speculation. He asked my advice as to {{some way of}} raising a large sum of money, much larger than he could hope to gain by any {{ordinary}} enterprise. I presumed {{that he was willing}} to speculate and I suggested these shares. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> as speculative as any man could desire." ...|$|E
6000|$|Buster's eyes snapped. [...] "I live on {{anything}} I can eat, and I can eat most everything. I suppose {{a lot of}} people think I live almost wholly on the little people who are my neighbors, but that is a mistake. I do catch Mice when I am lucky enough to find them where I can dig them out, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> good eating." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{appears to}} have {{snatched}} a fearful and but ill-concealed joy from {{the sight of the}} first collected edition of his son's works, unlike Tillotson as <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were.</b> Ah, had <b>they</b> only been Opera! Yet were they not volumes, after all, and able to stand on their own edges beside the immortals, if nothing more? ...|$|R
6000|$|Sixtus IV died, {{as we have}} seen, in August 1482. The {{death of}} a Pope was almost {{invariably}} the signal for disturbances in Rome, and <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not wanting on this occasion. The Riario palaces were stormed and looted, and Girolamo Riario--the Pope's [...] "nepot"--threw himself into the castle of Sant' Angelo with his forces.|$|R
60|$|Whether it {{was that}} Uncle Lance and Gerald were in a secret state of turmoil, or that their {{requirements}} were a good deal higher than for the Vale Leston audience, or perhaps {{that she had no}} inheritance of actress traditions, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> a great deal sharper with her than they had been ever before or with Ludmilla.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] replied Blacky, [...] "there is {{a certain}} {{farmyard}} I know of where the hens are not kept shut up {{at all in the}} daytime, but run around where they please. I see them every day when I am flying over. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> fine-looking hens. I don't think I've ever seen fatter ones. Some of them are so fat they can hardly run." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before {{this first}} {{discovery}} of New Jersey, the Lenni-Lenape had settled {{themselves in the}} beautiful and fertile country about the Susquehanna and the west shore of the Delaware, and here established their right to their name, which signifies [...] "original people;" [...] and if their stories are correct, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> the original inhabitants of this region, and they discovered New Jersey from the west, and took rightful possession of it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It can {{scarcely}} be expected, sir,' said Mrs Nickleby, fixing her eyes modestly on the ground, 'that I should tell a stranger whether I feel flattered and obliged by such proposals, or not. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> made under very singular circumstances; {{still at the}} same time, {{as far as it}} goes, and to a certain extent of course' (Mrs Nickleby's customary qualification), 'they must be gratifying and agreeable to one's feelings.' ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{performances}} on the {{pitch in the}} 1980s <b>were</b> steady, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not spectacular and the club paid the penalty for not building on earlier successes. Tommy Jackson took over in 1983, and led the Crues to their sole cup triumph during the decade, with the club winning the Gold Cup {{for the first time}} in the 1985-86 season.|$|R
5000|$|If the Russian force {{leaves the}} Pratzen Heights {{in order to}} go to the right side, <b>they</b> will <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> defeated. Napoleon ...|$|R
50|$|Harrington {{may have}} based the Rota Club after the Italian Academies {{he had seen}} on his travels through Europe. Such an {{organization}} would have been interesting to the Virtuosi, a class of men in England at this time, were a conscious replication of a similar Italian class of gentleman. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> interested in the exotic new coffee house and were frequenters of this club (and the Bower Street Club).|$|R
60|$|We have contested, step by step, many of Mr. Muller's propositions. If space permitted, {{it would}} be {{interesting}} to examine the actual attitude of certain contemporary savages, Bushmen and others, towards the sun. Contemporary savages may be degraded, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> not primitive, but their legends, at least, are the oldest things they possess. The supernatural elements in their ideas about the sun are curiously unlike those which, according to Mr. Muller, entered into the development of Aryan religion.|$|E
6000|$|... "In feeling, my friend; in feeling, often, though {{little in}} practice, {{in the sense}} that you mean. My family has been my congregation, unless, indeed, Miles here, and his beloved sister, can be added to my own {{children}} in fact, as <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> in affection. But, I can understand how butter made by the hands of one's own mother, or by those of such a pretty niece as your Kitty, would taste all the sweeter." ...|$|E
60|$|Every day {{we learn}} something. It is {{necessary}} {{to keep out of}} sight of these fish. After they bite, everything depends upon the skilful hooking of the fish. Probably it will require a good deal of skill to land them after you have hooked them, but we have had little experience at that so far. When these fish are along the shore <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>are</b> feeding, and presumably they are feeding on crabs of some sort. Bonefish appear to be game worthy of any fisherman's best efforts.|$|E
40|$|Because the Latter-day Saints {{love and}} honor Joseph Smith, {{we wish to}} create for him a family {{background}} in perfect harmony with his later life as a prophet. Not that his parents had to be wealthy or well-educated, for we know <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not, but we believe {{they must have been}} devout people who taught their son faith in the Christian religion and surrounded him with their love...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lads, {{welcome to}} Fort Henry," [...] said Colonel Zane, a smile {{lighting}} his dark face. [...] "The others {{of your party}} arrived safely. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> will <b>be</b> overjoyed to see you." ...|$|R
60|$|But brutes as <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>were,</b> <b>they</b> yet {{had enough}} of human nature in them to be shocked at their own hideousness; and still {{intending}} to groan, they uttered a viler grunt and squeal than before. So harsh and ear-piercing it was, {{that you would have}} fancied a butcher was sticking his knife into each of their throats, or, at the very least, that somebody was pulling every hog by his funny little twist of a tail.|$|R
