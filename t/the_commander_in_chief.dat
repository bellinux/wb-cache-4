5|$|With {{the initial}} peace treaty {{articles}} ratified in April 1783, a recently formed Congressional committee under Hamilton was considering needs {{and plans for}} a peacetime army. On May 2, 1783, <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> submitted his Sentiments on a Peace Establishment to the Committee, essentially providing an official Continental Army position. The original proposal was defeated in Congress in two votes (May 1783, October 1783), with a truncated version also being rejected in April 1784.|$|E
5|$|At {{the rank}} of commander, Callaghan captained the {{destroyer}} USS Reuben James from June 1936 to March 1938, and subsequently joined {{the staff of the}} Chief of Naval Operations in 1939. Before the US entered World War II, he was stationed in London in a logistical role.

5|$|Between 1794 and 1815, Wellesley {{participated in}} a number of {{military}} campaigns where he achieved tactical, strategic, and decisive victories in India and across six countries of western Europe. He faced and defeated many of Napoleon's marshals as <b>the</b> <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Anglo-Portuguese Army during the Peninsular War, but his best known battle was at Waterloo in 1815 where he led an Anglo-Allied force to a decisive victory over Napoleon I.

5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E
5|$|However, {{problems}} arose due to {{the inability}} of contemporary naval technology to simultaneously meet the requirements for weight, speed, range and armament. On 8 April 1938 German Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, <b>the</b> <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Kriegsmarine, informed the Oberkommando der Marine (German Naval High Command) that the Type 1937J design work was to be stopped, and that a further eight Type 36 destroyers were to be built instead. Although no ships of the Type 1937J were ever ordered or laid down, they influenced the later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Prussian Navy sent then-Korvettenkapitän Alexander von Monts to Austria {{to examine}} the new Whitehead torpedoes then being {{developed}} there. Albrecht von Stosch, <b>the</b> <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the new Imperial German Navy, approved a plan to develop a torpedo arm for the German fleet, and placed Monts {{in charge of the}} program in 1873. That year, Stosch's naval construction program called for a tender for the new torpedo boats. The tender was ordered from the British firm the Thames Iron Works, and named Zieten. She was to be the last major warship purchased by the German navy from a foreign shipyard.|$|E

5|$|In September 1914, Etna was {{withdrawn}} from {{service as a}} training ship and used instead as a floating headquarters. Italy entered World War I in May 1915 and the ship was thereafter used as a harbor defense ship before returning to her previous role as a headquarters ship for <b>the</b> <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Italian fleet at Taranto. By May 1917, she had been transferred to Brindisi, where she served as the headquarters ship for Rear Admiral Alfredo Acton during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto. The old cruiser was sold for scrapping on 15 May 1921, and was the last surviving ship of her class.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid {{was ordered}} to relieve Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher as {{commander}} of Cruiser Division 6, consisting of the heavy cruisers , Minneapolis and San Francisco. This {{was part of the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet, based at Pearl Harbor. He did not reach his new command until after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the U.S. into the war. When he reached Hawaii, Kinkaid stayed with his brother-in-law, <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief,</b> U.S. Fleet, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, who was married to Kinkaid's sister Dorothy. Kinkaid accompanied Fletcher as an observer during the attempt to relieve Wake Island, and did not formally assume command of the division until 29 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Washington gained {{valuable}} military skills {{during the}} war, acquiring tactical, strategic, and logistical military experience. He also acquired important political skills in {{his dealings with}} the British military establishment and the provincial government. His military exploits, although they included some notable failures, made his military reputation in the colonies such that he became a natural selection as <b>the</b> <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of the Continental Army following {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775. His successes in military and political spheres during that conflict led to his election as the first President of the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> West. The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, Spruance {{became chief}} of staff to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief,</b> U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) and Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA). In Halsey's {{continued}} absence, Kinkaid became commander of Task Force 16, built around the carrier , although he was not an aviator, and his experience with carriers had been restricted to commanding their screens at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway. In early July Kinkaid was briefed by Nimitz about plans for a landing in the Solomon Islands, codenamed Operation Watchtower. For this operation, Kinkaid's Task Force 16 would be one of three carrier task forces under Fletcher's overall command. To protect his flagship, Enterprise, Kinkaid had the battleship , heavy cruiser , antiaircraft cruiser , and five destroyers. The addition of the new battleship and its twenty /38 caliber dual-purpose guns greatly strengthened Task Force 16's antiaircraft defenses.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, <b>the</b> <b>commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, <b>the</b> <b>Commander</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E
