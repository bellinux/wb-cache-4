5|$|First {{played in}} 2002 {{when it was}} called the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl, {{organizers}} announced a new name in May 2004 for that year's iteration of the annual game for the 2004–05 NCAA football bowl season. The new title for the game was derived from the Emerald Nuts brand owned by the game's primary sponsor, Diamond Foods. Originally, the game was to feature the sixth bowl eligible <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pacific-10 Conference and the third eligible <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mountain West Conference.|$|E

In the quarterfinals, the first place team from one group plays the fourth place <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposite group, and the second place team from one group plays the third place <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposite group. The winners advance to the semi-finals. In cases where the quarter-final venues are deemed too far apart to allow easy travel between them, the teams stay within their groups for the quarters. The winners of the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals, with {{the winners of the}} semi-finals advancing to the Gold medal game and the losers advancing to the Bronze medal game.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-five {{nations have}} participated at the Rugby World Cup (excluding {{qualifying}} tournaments). Of the eight tournaments {{that have been}} held, all but one have been won by a national <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southern hemisphere. The southern hemisphere's dominance has been broken only in 2003, when England beat Australia in the final.|$|E
5|$|A <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 {{that it had}} measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
5|$|A {{tug of war}} tournament {{was held}} on 16 July at Catalan Cross, Boulogne Forest in Paris {{as part of the}} 1900 Summer Olympics. The only match of the tournament was played between a <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Racing Club de France, {{representing}} France, and a mixed team consisting of three Danish athletes and three Swedish athletes.

5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds {{was sent to}} Hiroshima to evaluate {{the effects of the}} blast. From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E
5|$|After losing {{two teams}} {{at the end}} of the 2008–09 season the Elite League was boosted by a new {{franchise}} joining the league. Braehead Clan were announced as the ninth <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2010–11 season. On 27 April 2010, Dundee Stars were unanimously accepted into the League by the EIHL board as the tenth team.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century Camber Castle and the {{surrounding}} farmland remained in private ownership and open to visitors. In the 1931 there was a proposal to turn the keep into a golf clubhouse but the project was not taken forward and the facility was built at the nearby Castle Farm instead. A research <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Victoria County History project visited the castle in 1935, resulting in the first – albeit cursory – historical analysis and survey of the fortification being published two years later.|$|E

5|$|Bradford City {{became the}} first league {{football}} <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> county, before they even had a team or played a game. They and Chelsea, who were elected to the league two years later, share {{the distinction of being}} the only clubs to join the league without having played a competitive fixture. A summer archery contest, which had been organised {{to raise money for the}} rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of claret and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's hoops changed to stripes.|$|E
5|$|Curling is a {{team sport}} that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's tournament {{was held at the}} 1924 Winter Olympics before the sport was removed from the {{official}} programme until the 1998 Games. For 82years, the 1924 tournament was considered a demonstration sport, so the medals were not officially counted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The tournament was won by a <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland, who represented Great Britain. In 2006, Scottish newspaper The Herald conducted an investigation that found evidence that curling {{had been part of the}} official programme. The IOC subsequently recognized the top three teams as full medal winners.|$|E
5|$|Examination by {{a severe}} weather <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bureau of Meteorology {{examined}} the {{damage in the}} Bucca and Kolan region and recorded it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale. This corresponds to the tornado being able to produce winds between 331 and 417 kilometres per hour and of 'devastating' intensity. This is the first tornado ever to be recorded as an F4 in Australian history.|$|E

5|$|For the 1969 season, a {{first round}} was added whereby each {{division}} winner played the second-place <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other division. The winners of these games {{met in the}} AFL Championship Game. In the only year of this format, the AFL Champion Kansas City Chiefs were the second-place team in the Western division. The Chiefs {{went on to win}} Super Bowl IV that season, thus becoming the first non-division winner to win a Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the <b>team</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, few {{countries}} in the world had a women's national football team, including Sudan.
