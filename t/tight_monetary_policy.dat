[...] The US government was taking money out of circulation to achieve this goal, therefore there was less available money to facilitate trade. [...] Because of this monetary policy the price of silver started to fall causing considerable losses of asset values; by most accounts, after 1879 production was growing, thus further putting downward pressure on prices due to increased industrial productivity, trade and competition.|$|E
2500|$|The Fourth Labour {{government}}, {{elected in}} July 1984, {{moved away from}} government intervention {{in the economy and}} allowed free market mechanisms to dominate.

The changes included making the Reserve Bank independent of political decisions; performance contracts for senior civil servants; public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting; tax neutrality; subsidy-free agriculture; and industry-neutral competition regulation. [...] Government subsidies including agricultural subsidies were eliminated; import regulations were loosened up; the exchange rate was floated; and controls on interest rates, wages, and prices were removed; and personal rates of taxation were reduced. <b>Tight</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and major efforts to reduce the government budget deficit brought the inflation rate down from an annual rate of more than 18% in 1987.
