The left guard and left tackle are pulling or turning, and running to the right parallel with the line of scrimmage. The left guard will block the last defensive player on the line of scrimmage and the tackle will cut underneath him and block the first defender in the hole.|$|E

5000|$|According to Alasdair Pinkerton, {{an expert}} in human {{geography}} at the Royal Holloway University of London, the term is first mentioned in Domesday Book in the 11th century to describe parcels of land that were just beyond the London city walls. The Oxford English Dictionary contains {{a reference to the}} term dating back to 1320, and spelled nonesmanneslond, when the term was used to describe a disputed territory or one over which there was legal disagreement. The same term was later used as the name for the piece of land outside the north wall of London that was assigned as the place of execution. The term was applied to a little-used area on ships called the forecastle, a place where various ropes, <b>tackle,</b> <b>block,</b> and other supplies were stored. In the United Kingdom several places called No Man's Land denoted [...] "extra-parochial spaces that were beyond the rule of the church, beyond the rule of different fiefdoms that were handed out by the king … ribbons of land between these different regimes of power".|$|E

40|$|Rigging blocks are {{absolutely}} {{essential to the}} operation of a large sailing vessel, yet little has been published on these vital pieces of hardware. This thesis examines and analyzes the rigging and gun <b>tackle</b> <b>blocks</b> found {{in association with the}} Swedish royal warship, Vasa, lost in Stockholm Harbor on its maiden voyage on 10 August 1628. It explores the typology, nomenclature, historical development, and the physical mechanics of block technology and its application aboard square-rigged ships from antiquity to the 17 th century. Vasa’s blocks are discussed in detail, focusing on form, distribution at the wreck site, and interpretations of certain identifiable groups of blocks and a suggested reconstruction of the use and placement of these blocks in the rig. The final section compares Vasa’s rigging and gun <b>tackle</b> <b>blocks</b> to other archaeological examples from the period and draws conclusions regarding the patterns of block design, manufacturing methods, and national rigging practices. This archaeological information is then combined with the limited historical sources available to deduce the nature of the working environment of the navy yard blockmaker and the broader social organizatio...|$|R
