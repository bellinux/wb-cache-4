5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, <b>the</b> <b>carrot,</b> like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|He {{intends to}} feed Alec <b>the</b> <b>carrot,</b> but {{realizes that he}} is late for the show and rushes off to the stage without doing so, much to Alec's chagrin. Presto tries to start the performance, but Alec becomes {{reluctant}} to cooperate until he is given <b>the</b> <b>carrot.</b> After Alec hits his master's hand on the podium he is standing on, Presto then spends {{the rest of the}} show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> or the closely related parsnip.|$|E

50|$|Tea {{and carrots}} are a still {{consumed}} together in Lorraine. The {{origin of the}} tradition dates to medieval times. Knights errant would enjoy black tea and <b>the</b> local porous <b>carrots</b> (nicknamed Karotewasser in Germany); they would dunk <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> into <b>the</b> liquid to soak up the tea. Medically, people now {{understand that there are}} health benefits from consuming the antioxidants of tea and the beta carotene of <b>the</b> <b>carrots.</b>|$|R
50|$|If carrots {{are grown}} in soil {{which has been}} manured that year, some of <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> are strange shapes because <b>the</b> young <b>carrot</b> plant's roots go off in odd directions, drawn by {{irregular}} pockets of manured soil.|$|R
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{agriculture}} is {{found only in}} the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in <b>the</b> <b>Carrot</b> Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carrot</b> is a diploid species, and {{has nine}} {{relatively}} short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18). The genome size {{is estimated to}} be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about {{the same size as the}} rice genome.|$|E
50|$|What's Up Shock: In {{this final}} {{qualifying}} round, one player from each team had {{to attempt to}} take up to 18 carrots from Hare's allotment by taking them from electrified wires. If the ring attached to <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> hit <b>the</b> wire, <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> must be forfeited to Hare's bin. Carrots that were won could be deposited in a team's basket.|$|R

5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted {{by the smell of}} bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|Furious, Presto {{tries to}} attack Alec, {{but in an}} act to defend himself, Alec puts an offstage ladder into the wizard hat, and Presto is hit between his legs. Presto {{attempts}} to hit Alec with it, but it misses and hits a backstage door, and Presto ends up getting pushed across the stage. Presto antagonizes Alec again, covering <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> with a cloth before smashing it into a pulp {{with a piece of}} the ladder. Alec furiously retaliates by aiming the opening of the wizard's hat towards an electrical socket which Presto's fingers go into, shocking Presto into dancing wildly to bluegrass music.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carrot</b> (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the cliff}} hanger {{at the end}} of Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space, <b>the</b> mutated <b>carrot</b> has spawned {{hundreds}} of zombie carrots which once they bite a victim they take control of the subject's mind. Dr. Cockroach determines {{that the only way to}} defeat <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> and free their victims is for B.O.B. to eat all of <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> (specifically because B.O.B. has no brain and thus is immune to the carrots' mind control powers), which B.O.B eventually, albeit reluctantly, does. At the end of the short, B.O.B. is turned into a giant zombie carrot.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carrot</b> {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots {{are also a}} good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>carrot</b> is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a root {{vegetable}} {{closely related to}} <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
50|$|Hot Hare Balloons: In {{this final}} {{qualifying}} round, up to 18 carrots were available. One player {{sat in a}} chair suspended by balloons above the Hare's allotment. The player had to take <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> from <b>the</b> allotment using long hooks, whilst avoiding motion sensitive lasers, putting it in the bin next to their chair. If the lasers were activated, an alarm went off, and <b>the</b> <b>carrots</b> had to be forfeited to Hare's bin.|$|R

5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto Pam to avoid admitting the truth, making Pam uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay. Jim, Dwight, and Pam, out of solidarity to Nellie, sabotage the magician's tricks until he reaches breaking point and Dwight kicks him out. Nellie and Robert commend {{the employees}} for throwing a good party, but Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) complains that <b>the</b> <b>carrot</b> cake has actual vegetables in it, which Pam {{made as a}} prank. When Jim and Pam leave for the day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician into the elevator {{when he was asked}} not to. Hank, busy reading a magazine, claims not to have noticed him, stating that as a magician he could have slipped by.|$|E
