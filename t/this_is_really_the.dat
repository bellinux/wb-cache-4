25|$|However, {{more recent}} {{biological}} analyses, such as Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, have contended that Morgan's Canon {{is not the}} simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent features of evolution.|$|E
25|$|In the narrative, {{just prior}} to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his {{brothers}} (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular, and he gives Benjamin {{five times as much}} food as he apportions to the others. According to textual scholars, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} Xander's dream is {{his sense of}} failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life. His fear that he is stuck is reiterated {{throughout}} his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents' home. No matter where his dream takes him, he ends up back in the basement. As {{the only one of}} the Scoobies not in college, he feels anxiety about his ability to understand and keep up with ideas and conversations, a fear which is realized when he goes to the university, a place he already feels excluded from, and finds that he cannot understand what people say to him. Aware that he is being chased and is in danger, he asks Giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer, nor what Anya says to him, as they are both inexplicably speaking French. He exclaims, [...] "I don't understand!" [...] During his dream both Buffy and Willow tell him, [...] "I'm way ahead of you," [...] and Giles tells him [...] "the others have gone on ahead," [...] underscoring his fear that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E
2500|$|Carla Day {{writing for}} Collider.com gave The Flash episode 5 stars out of 5, calling the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] saying, [...] "With so many {{characters}} on the scene, {{it would have}} been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose The Flash's unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor... the standard has been set high for the Arrow and Legends of Tomorrows [...] "Invasion!" [...] hours." [...] Day's one complaint was the fact the Dominators motivations were not very clear. Entertainment Weeklys Chancellor Agard awarded The Flash episode an [...] "A-", stating, [...] "Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet. The first crossovers were two relatively standalone episodes, and last year's was burdened with setting up Legends of Tomorrow. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> first time Berlanti and Co. can tell a cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off... That being said, the episode did drag a bit whenever it focused too much on the ongoing Team Flash drama... my biggest problems were with the Wally stuff. However, I understand that was here for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans. Luckily, though, the nonsense doesn't drag the episode too much: For every anxious scene, there was a funny aside to lighten the mood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fletcher and Hurd {{state that}} unions may also face issues of {{resistance}} by pre-existing [...] "staff," [...] {{who may be}} hesitant or even suspicious at {{the adoption of the}} organizing model. Dealing with resistant staff would be a major disadvantage of using the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with. Fletcher and Hurd assert that, {{based on the fact that}} unions employing the organizing model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, [...] "...following the organizing model creates more work than sticking to the servicing model." [...] Richard Hurd argues that the organizing model can, at times, create [...] "...continual warfare..." [...] between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers [...] "...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle." [...] If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain the organizing model for long periods of time. Fred Glass says that [...] "...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications" [...] because the organizing model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently. Bob Carter, in regard to the organizing model [...] in British unions, is concerned with the method of implementation and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing. Carter says that [...] "A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion..." [...] Carter worries about whether or not workers are a part of the transition process and whether they consent to all of the implications that come with the organizing model.|$|E
