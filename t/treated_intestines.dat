5000|$|With World War I, Germany {{experienced}} a rapid liberalization of sexual values and {{sexually transmitted diseases}} spread rapidly. During this time, the majority of condoms were still made of [...] "skin": chemically <b>treated</b> <b>intestine</b> or bladder. [...] Rubber condoms were also available; they were made by wrapping raw rubber sheets around molds, then dipping them in a solution to vulcanize the rubber. In 1912, Fromm invented the cement dipping method, which made a thinner, seamless condom. [...] Instead of working with rubber as a solid material, it was mixed with gasoline or benzene. This made it a liquid in which molds could be dipped. [...] Fromm patented his invention in 1916. Mass production started in 1922 and was a great success—Fromms Act, as they were called, becoming the first brand-name condoms—which allowed the entrepreneur soon to open up branches in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands. Fromms became a synonym for condom in Germany. In 1920 Fromm was naturalized a German citizen. In 1928, the first condom vending machines were installed by Fromm's company, but the interior ministry only allowed it to advertise the hygienic advantages of condoms, not the condom's use as a contraceptive, because it feared a further decrease of the birth rate.|$|R
40|$|Background. This {{study was}} pathway of (−) -epicatechin (EC) in the {{prevention}} and treatment of intestine inflammation in acute and chronic rat models. Methods. Intestine inflammation was induced in rats using TNBS. The morphological, inflammatory, immunohistochemical, and immunoblotting characteristics of colon samples were examined. The effects of EC were evaluated in an acute model at doses of 5, 10, 25, and 50 [*]mg/kg by gavage for 5 days. The chronic colitis model was induced 1 st day, and treated for 21 days. For the colitis relapse model, the induction was repeated on 14 th. Results. EC 10 and EC 50 effectively reduced the lesion size, as assessed macroscopically; and confirmed by microscopy for EC 10. The glutathione levels were higher in EC 10 group but decreased COX- 2 expression and increased cell proliferation (PC) were observed, indicating an anti-inflammatory activity and a proliferation-stimulating effect. In the chronic colitis model, EC 10 showed lower macroscopic and microscopic lesion scores and increase in glutathione levels. As in the acute model, a decrease in COX- 2 expression {{and an increase in}} PC in EC 10, the chronic model this increase maybe by the pathway EGF expression. Conclusion. These results confirm the activity of EC as an antioxidant that reduces of the lesion and that has the potential to stimulate tissue healing, indicating useful for preventing and <b>treating</b> <b>intestine</b> inflammation...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} using commensal bacteria as signal mediators for inhibiting the disease cholera, we stably transformed Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (Nissle) to express the autoinducer molecule cholera autoinducer 1 (CAI- 1) (shown previously to prevent virulence when present with another signaling molecule, autoinducer 2, at high concentrations) and determined the effect on Vibrio cholerae virulence gene expression and colonization in an infant mouse model. We found that pretreatment of mice for 8  h with Nissle engineered to express CAI- 1 (Nissle-cqsA) greatly increased the mice’s survival (92 %) from ingestion of V. cholerae. Pretreatment with Nissle-cqsA for only 4  h increased survival by 77 %, whereas ingesting Nissle-cqsA {{at the same time as}} V. cholerae increased survival rates by 27 %. Immunostaining revealed an 80 % reduction in cholera toxin binding to the intestines of mice pretreated for 8  h with Nissle-cqsA. Further, the numbers of V. cholerae in <b>treated</b> mouse <b>intestines</b> was reduced by 69 % after 40  h. This finding points to an easily administered and inexpensive approach where commensal bacteria are engineered to communicate with invasive species and potentially prevent human disease...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{perfusion}} of rat intestine {{was used}} to evaluate the effect of bicarbonate on the efficacy of a low sodium (35 mmol/l) glucose-electrolyte oral rehydration solution in normal and cholera toxin-treated rat small intestine. In normal intestine, absorption of water was greater (108 (8. 1) microliters/min/g; p less than 0. 01) and sodium secretion less (- 4. 3 (0. 3) mumol/min/g; p less than 0. 01) from the oral rehydration solution containing bicarbonate than from the solution in which bicarbonate was replaced by chloride ions (59. 5 (7. 2) microliters/min/g and - 7. 8 (0. 8) mumol/min/g, respectively). Glucose absorption in normal intestine was similar with both solutions. In the secreting intestine, both oral rehydration solutions reversed net water secretion to absorption, but inclusion of bicarbonate resulted in significantly less net absorption of both water (2. 18 (6. 9) microliters/min/g; p less than 0. 05) and glucose (18. 7 (2. 1) mumol/min/g; p less than 0. 001) compared with bicarbonate free oral rehydration solution (19. 4 (3. 9) microliters/min/g and 35. 8 (3. 7) mumol/min/g, respectively). Net sodium secretion occurred in normal and secreting intestine but was significantly less with the bicarbonate containing oral rehydration solution. These findings suggest that the demonstrable advantage of bicarbonate in promoting water absorption from this oral rehydration solution in normal rat intestine does not apply to cholera toxin <b>treated</b> secreting <b>intestine...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hepatectomy {{has been}} the {{standard}} treatment for metachronic metastases of non-colorectal (NCR) origin, mainly when the disease-free interval is more than two years. Laparoscopic hepatectomy has become the golden standard mainly for left side resections, due to lower morbidity, shorter hospital stay, early recovery and good cosmetic outcome. The authors report {{the case of a}} female patient with two metachronic metastases (ten years of disease-free survival), of non-colorectal origin (adenocarcinoma of small <b>intestine),</b> <b>treated</b> by laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy (left hepatic lobectomy) with success. The postoperative progress was satisfactory. To date, the patient has presented no tumoral recurrence (six months of follow-up period). Laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy can be satisfactorily performed in selected cases of hepatic metastasis. This approach presents low morbidity and good cosmetic result. The lack of alternative treatments and the poor prognosis of untreated cases have justified surgical resection in order to increase overall survival. Nevertheless, this approach should be performed by hepatic surgery expertise teams trained on advanced laparoscopic procedures...|$|R
40|$|The outer {{membrane}} protein OmpU of Vibrio cholerae O 1 strain 86 B 3 was characterized {{with reference to}} colonization of the intestine by the organism. The purified OmpU exhibited a pI of 3. 6. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it migrated to 38, 32, and 110 kDa when the sample was heated at 100 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 15 min, and room temperature for 30 min, respectively. The purified OmpU was not hemagglutinative. Anti-OmpU serum did not agglutinate strain 86 B 3 or other V. cholerae organisms. OmpU adhered to the brush border of the rabbit small intestine; adhesion of the organisms to the <b>intestine</b> <b>treated</b> in advance with OmpU was not inhibited. Treating the organisms in advance with anti-OmpU Fab did not inhibit adhesion to the intestine. These results obtained in vitro suggest that OmpU {{is not involved in}} the adhesion of V. cholerae to the intestinal epithelium...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{microorganisms}} of genera {{responsible for}} vector-borne diseases (VBD) has hematophagous arthropods as vector/reservoir. Recently, many {{new species of}} such microorganisms were found in various terrestrial and aquatic eukaryotic hosts: numerous new bacterial species belonging/related to the genus Rickettsia(Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales; with obligate intracellular lifestyle) were discovered in protist ciliates. Although their pathogenicity for either humans or animals is still under study, these bacteria could actually act as etiological agents of possible VBD in aquatic environment. Indeed, {{an increasing number of}} massive fish death was recorded in intensive aquaculture facilities during the lasts years due to epidemics caused by Rickettsia-like bacteria with unknown natural vector. As ciliates could vector pathogenic organisms possibly responsible for zoonosis, this study was meant to verify the transmission of the Rickettsiales endosymbionts hosted by two species of ciliates to a metazoan model, the planarian Dugesia japonica. The ciliates were Euplotes woodruffi and Paramecium multimicronucleatum; the first hosts in the cytoplasm two differentRickettsiales endosymbionts, Candidatus (Ca) Megaira polyxenophila 9 ̆d and Ca. Bandiella woodruffiiâ 9 ̆d, and the betaproteobacterium Polynucleobacter necessarius; the second hosts in the macronucleus a subspecies of the Rickettsiales endosymbiont Ca. Trichorickettsia mobilis 9 ̆d. Ciliate monoclonal mass cultures were set up for trans-infection experiments via os: 1. Washed, concentrated ciliates were homogenized, pelleted, and added to regular food for planarians. 2. Antibiotic-treated planarians were fed on ciliate-enriched food or regular food (control), washed, and let digest for 1, 2, 3, and 7 days. 3. A comparative multidisciplinary investigation through DNA extraction-PCR procedure, and TEM observation was performed. DNA of endosymbionts was recovered up to 7 days after feeding in treated planarians, and we could identified bacteria at TEM in <b>treated</b> planarians <b>intestine</b> also outside digestive vacuoles, indicating that they somehow are able to avoid animal digestion...|$|R
40|$|Background: Magnolia officinalis cortex {{has been}} {{traditionally}} used to <b>treat</b> stomach and <b>intestine</b> diseases in traditional Korean medicine. In this study, we investigated {{the effect of}} water extract of M. officinalis cortex (WEMC) on osteoclast differentiation and function. Methods: Phytochemical characterization of WEMC was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophages was determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity assay. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) signaling factors and transcription factors regulating osteoclast differentiation were analyzed by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Bone resorption function of mature osteoclasts was examined by using culture plate coated with inorganic crystalline calcium phosphate. Furthermore, the in vivo effect of WEMC on osteoporosis was examined using RANKL-induced bone loss model, characterized by micro-computed tomography and bone metabolism marker analysis. Results: WEMC inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and the bone resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts. WEMC contains gallic acid and honokiol as active constituents contributing to the inhibitory effect of WEMC on osteoclast differentiation. Further, WEMC suppressed RANKL-induced activation of p 38 and nuclear factor-κB pathways and expression of osteoclastogenic transcription factors such as c-Fos for AP- 1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1. Ectopic overexpression of a constitutive active form of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 rescued the antiosteoclastogenic effect of WEMC. Consistent with the in vitro results, WEMC suppressed RANKL-induced trabecular bone loss in mice. Conclusion: WEMC might have a therapeutic potential to treat pathological bone diseases due to increased osteoclast differentiation and function...|$|R
40|$|The {{endogenous}} nitrosation {{of dietary}} amino acids and peptides {{may be a}} major source of genotoxic damage in the stomach and lower GI tract. Amongst the many N-alkyl-N-nitrosocompounds and related compounds, there are a number which share the common features of being derived from glycine and are carboxymethylating agents.;Novel immunoaffinity-RP-HPLC-fluorescence methods were developed allowing the concomitant detection of O 6 -carboxymethyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (O 6 -CMdG) and O 6 -methyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (O 6 -MedG) with limits of detection of 0. 128 mol O 6 -CMdG/mol dG and 0. 064 mol O 6 MedG/mol dG in lmg of DNA. N-(N'-acetyl-L-prolyl) -N-nitrosoglycine (APNG), azaserine and potassium diazoacetate (KDA) all reacted with calf thymus DNA in vitro to give the expected O 6 -CMdG as well as lesser amounts of O 6 -MedG. The ratios of O 6 -MedG to O 6 -CMdG were 1 : 9. 73 (APNG), 1 : 16. 12. (KDA) and 1 : 38. 45 (azaserine). However, these nitrosated glycine derivatives showed large differences in their capacity to alkylate DNA with O 6 -alkylation formation ratios of 1 : 12. 1 : 137. 9 for 5 mM azaserine, APNG and KDA respectively.;As O 6 -CMdG is not repaired by O 6 -alkylguanine alkyl transferases and is likely to be persistent in mammalian tissues, a sensitive immunoslotblot assay (0. 32 mol O 6 -CMdG/mol dG) which required only 1 g DNA for O 6 -CMdG was developed. O 6 -CMdG was detected in the stomach DNA of experimental animals treated with KDA or APNG by gastric intubation. Interestingly, control animals and non-target tissues of <b>treated</b> animals (liver, <b>intestine)</b> also had detectable levels of O 6 -CMdG.;Examination of the DNA from human gastric biopsies from 30 individuals involved in a H. pylori study, revealed detectable amounts of O 6 -CMdG in 27 samples ranging from 0. 60 - 19. 79 mol/mol dG. No statistically significant difference was found between individuals with or without H. pylori infection on the basis of O 6 -CMdG levels, although the highest levels observed were all in infected individuals...|$|R
40|$|Decisions in health-care {{have become}} {{extremely}} complex and difficult since they involve a complex web of input and uncertainties. It {{is necessary to}} draw information from many sources such as primary data, preference of patients, clinical experiences, personal opinions, medical and legal regulations and, last but not least, scientific evidence. Nevertheless, {{the weight of the}} scientific evidence is critical, and indeed the evidence-based approach is now a “must”. However, the number of scientific publications exploded over the last 50 years, making scientific updating very difficult. Scientific publications taken individually or in small groups selected randomly, can often present confusing and, in some cases, even contradictory results. To establish efficacy, safety as well as utility of a health-intervention it has become increasingly common performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. These tools allow to get an updated and a comprehensive assessment (even if not the definite one) of the health-intervention evaluated. In this dissertation, we present the results of an evidence-based approach concerning three gastroenterological issues. It was assessed the effectiveness and the safety of rifaximin to <b>treat</b> the small <b>intestine</b> bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by an increased number and/or abnormal type of bacteria in the small bowel, and well-recognized as cause of maldigestion and malabsorption. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, covering Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganism, both aerobes and anaerobes, fulfilling the characteristics set by DuPont and Ericsson for the ideal antimicrobial that should be used for the treatment of gastrointestinal infections. As a consequence, over the past decades, rifaximin has been largely used to treat SIBO even if {{there was a lack of}} a critical summary of evidence. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses represent the basis do draw evidence-based guidelines on drug use in given clinical conditions. By reviewing and distilling a large body of literature, we developed a Position Paper addressing benefits and harms proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in the treatment of acid-related diseases. Studies in primary care and emergency settings have indeed suggested that PPIs are frequently prescribed for inappropriate indications or for indications where their use offers little benefit. Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes as well as drug-to-drug interactions. Finally, since National Health Systems are currently collapsing, pharmacoeconomic analysis represents an integral part of the decision process. However, the evaluation of economic impact of a given treatment is often biased and influenced by Companies’ pressure. In this connection, we showed that the conclusions of an article concerning tapentadol ER - in comparison with oxycodone/naloxone CR - were misleading. Indeed, with a robust methodological and meta-analytic approach we were able to show that the comparisons made by the Authors were incorrect and actually reached an opposed conclusion...|$|R

The interview design was checked by experts for content validity index and adjusted after testing on 13 non-target men. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using percentage and groups split by symptoms. The results showed that most traditional doctors (68. 4 %) were males; 52. 6 % were 41 - 60 years old and 39. 1 % were more than 61 years of age. 60. 2 % of the subjects were Muslims; 73. 7 % of them were agri- culturalists; 63. 2 % of them had the income ranging from 3, 001 - 6, 000 baht/month. Most of the subjects (77. 4 %) had only primary education, and 15. 0 % finished high school level. Only 6. 0 % practised traditional medicine as their main occupation and most of them (94. 0 %) did not practise traditional medicine as their main occupation. Most traditional doctors (91. 0 %) had experience in using medicinal herbs for animal treatment; 30. 0 % citing that herbal medicine was easy to find in local areas; 26. 8 % citing that it was cheap.
