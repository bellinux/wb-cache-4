5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Dr. Paul Browning (Joe Thompson), who assumes {{she is a}} prostitute and pays her afterwards. Mercedes becomes a cleaner in a {{hospital}} along with Lynsey. Mercedes meets Doctor Browning {{at the hospital and}} he asks to keep seeing and paying Mercedes, which she agrees to. Mercedes convinces Lynsey to help a patient who is DNR.

60|$|Lady Harman essayed to speak. But {{she found}} that {{directly}} she set herself to speak she sobbed and began weeping.

25|$|Once a {{ship was}} encountered, whilst the cargo vessel heaved-to the cutter would pull-in on the lee-side. The {{apprentice}} would then row the {{pilot in the}} punt to the vessel, whilst the captain would sail-clear; the cutter would then return once the pilot was on board and the vessel underway. If the cutter had two pilots on board, the sequence would be repeated for a second vessel; if not, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> race away home.|$|E
25|$|The king {{asked his}} {{daughter}} {{what were the}} three misfortunes that the marriage should ease. Miaoshan explained that the first misfortune the marriage should ease was the suffering people endure as they age. The second misfortune it should ease was the suffering people endure when they fall ill. The third misfortune it should ease was the suffering caused by death. If the marriage could not ease any of the above, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather retire {{to a life of}} religion forever.|$|E

25|$|The thali is {{an emblem}} {{shaped like a}} leaf and which is worn as a necklace. The wearing {{of it has been}} {{compared}} to a wedding ring as for most women in south India it denotes that they are married. The thalikettu kalyanam was the ritual during which the thali would be tied on a piece of string around the neck of a Nair girl. If the girl should reach puberty before the ceremony took place <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> in theory have been out-caste, although it is probable that this stricture was not in fact observed.|$|E
25|$|The detectives on {{the case}} ordered wiretappings on Castor's house. They listened in on phone calls for any unusual conversations. In addition, they set up cameras {{overlooking}} Castor's house and her husbands' gravesites, who had been buried side by side at Castor's request. Detectives reasoned that if Castor were truly genuine about her love for her late husbands, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> eventually visit their graves. They wanted to observe her behavior while there. Castor, however, never visited. The investigators soon felt {{the only way to}} prove Castor responsible for both homicides was to have Wallace's body exhumed. A toxicology screening ruled that Wallace had also been killed through antifreeze poisoning.|$|E

Marie was distraught and wrote in her journal: [...] "Can anything ever be the same?" [...] After Bucharest fell to Austrian troops, the royal court was transferred to Iași, capital of the Moldavia region, in December 1916. There, she continued {{to act as a}} nurse in military hospitals. Daily, Marie would dress as a nurse and go to the train station, where she would receive more injured soldiers; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> transport them to hospital.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Kydd {{announced}} that she was leaving the Phoenix after just one season, a move that stunned coach Julie Hoornweg. Kydd {{said that she was}} travelling overseas with her husband, leading to speculation she would play in New Zealand. Hoornweg said that if she had known that Kydd would not keep her long term commitment, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have rather invested in young talent, referring to Kydd as a [...] "player at risk". In November, New Zealand's Canterbury Flames announced Kydd in their squad for the 2007 National Bank Cup. Her contract was to start in February 2007, so that she could fulfil work commitments with Youth Hostels Association, Victoria. However, Kydd withdrew her services to the Flames without playing a match, citing medical advice, due to a concussion incident. In late 2007, Kydd was playing mixed netball in the United Kingdom in the PIM Mixed A competition.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, Eva {{embarked}} on a much-publicized [...] "Rainbow Tour" [...] of Europe, meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state, such as Francisco Franco and Pope Pius XII. Biographers Fraser and Navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Perón. For political reasons {{it was decided that}} Eva, rather than Juan Perón, should make the visit. Fraser and Navarro write that Argentina had only recently emerged from its [...] "wartime quarantine", thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Franco, with António Salazar of Portugal the last remaining west European authoritarian leaders in power, would be diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Fraser and Navarro write that Eva decided that, if Juan Perón would not accept Franco's invitation for a state visit to Spain, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> Advisors then decided that Eva should visit many European countries in addition to Spain. This would make it seem that Eva's sympathies were not specifically with Franco's fascist Spain but with all of Europe. The tour was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political [...] "goodwill" [...] tour.|$|E
500|$|Having {{started his}} career as a remixer, Pettibone built the basic music of the Erotica songs in the style of his remixes for which Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics. According to Pettibone in an article [...] "Erotica Diaries" [...] {{published}} on Madonna's Icon magazine, he began with a tape of three tracks for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working on demos in his apartment in October 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet André Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone. [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar.|$|E
500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she,</b> who <b>would</b> not {{embrace him}} before all those folk, curtseyed till her knee almost touched the ground, while low he bent before her, {{a strange and}} stately parting, or so thought that company; and taking the hand of Betty, Margaret left him.|$|R

The Alley sketches made only one further cast change, when Peter Donald's chipper Irishman Ajax Cassidy succeeded Reed's Falstaff.|$|E

But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person.
