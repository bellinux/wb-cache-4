500|$|... "Coming of Age" [...] {{examines}} Gethenian {{sexuality in}} greater detail than in Left Hand. In describing the story, Le Guin stated: It seemed high time we got {{all the way into}} a kemmerhouse. With a native guide, instead of a poor uptight Earth guy trying to figure out what's going on and being disturbed by it... Left Hand gives the reader very little opportunity to experience being double-gendered [...] I wanted to explore it as a natural, universal experience, instead of a weird alien condition. Back in 1968, I and most readers needed Genly Ai's POV to mediate the strangeness. I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> now. She referred to the story as a sexual footnote to Left Hand.|$|E
2500|$|As Kihlstrom put it, [...] "any modern {{commentators}} {{exaggerate the}} extent of Gage's personality change, perhaps engaging {{in a kind of}} retrospective reconstruction based on what we now know, or <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> {{about the role of the}} frontal cortex in self-regulation.|$|E
60|$|Shall you really, dearest Mrs. Martin, come again? Don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} of the hope you left us. Because we do indeed.|$|E
60|$|FANNY. Yes. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> {{the old man}} credit. [With a laugh.] John Bull's daughters, {{they called}} us in Paris.|$|R
6000|$|... "I used to {{tell her}} not to overwalk herself this weather," [...] said Clym, with distress. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> well in using the adder's fat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{those little}} rolls and pats of butter!' said Mr. Ormsby. 'Short commons, though. What <b>do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in my time? We {{used to send}} over {{the way to get}} a mutton-chop.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Cel. I {{have seen}} him somewhere, but where I know not:--Pry'thee, my friend, leave us; dost thou <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know our way in court? ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. DON, reluctantly, 'He says we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> He {{says they}} {{would not want to}} {{communicate}} with us if they had such trivial things to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Know it!" [...] exclaimed Joe, [...] "I should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> Why, it's not so {{long ago}} that I picked one up myself. But what were ye goin' to say, mate?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a good deal, and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> Time <b>did</b> as well," [...] said Jonas Bonnier, {{head of the}} Bonnier Magazine Group. Bonnier {{already had}} a small {{footprint}} in the US through a 50 percent stake in Winter Park, Florida-based World Publications, which owned the titles Islands and Spa, Saveur, Water Skiing, and Caribbean Travel & Life.|$|R
50|$|I really don't <b>think</b> what <b>we</b> got {{was a great}} bargain. Nothing we {{selected}} was a real winner that I'd {{fight to the death}} for. In terms of what we had to work with, though, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the best <b>we</b> could.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{always thought}} God {{put us in}} this {{position}} so we could break down some walls or notions about Christian music...I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that with touring, and with the eventual release of Mercury." [...] —Eric Campuzano ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, incos, {{what are}} we to do?" [...] the chief asked. [...] "We have brought you here, and now we are ready to die if you tell us. What you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this morning," [...] he answered. [...] "I think I {{heard the}} {{conductor}} {{say that they}} have a lot of milk cans to put off here this morning. I'll just go and find out, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have not}} the remotest idea of it. They have no {{conception}} {{of what a}} society woman goes through with. They <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> nothing. They envy us, too, and sometimes they're so ungrateful and indifferent, {{if you try to}} help them, or get on terms with them, that I believe they hate us." ...|$|E
5000|$|The drums {{used on the}} Time track are roto-toms. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> some {{experiments}} with some other drums called boo-bans, which are very small, tuned drums, but the roto-toms actually gave the best effect. Nick Mason ...|$|R
500|$|I really don't <b>think</b> what <b>we</b> got {{was a great}} bargain. [...] Nothing we {{selected}} was a real winner that I'd {{fight to the death}} for. [...] In terms of what we had to work with, though, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> the best <b>we</b> could.|$|R
5000|$|After {{being asked}} {{how long the}} video took to make, Martika stated [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it in about, it couldn't {{have been more than}} an hour at the most. I was running late for {{something}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he isn't a bad pun--or even a high {{flight of}} American humour. He has a {{beautiful}} nature," [...] Henrietta went on. [...] "I've studied him {{for many years and}} I see right through him. He's as clear as the style of a good prospectus. He's not intellectual, but he appreciates intellect. On the other hand he doesn't exaggerate its claims. I sometimes <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in the United States." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Napier's {{little book}} is a reprint of two 'Edinburgh Review' {{articles}} on Bacon and Raleigh. The first, a learned statement of facts in answer to some unwisdom of a 'Quarterly' reviewer (possibly an Oxford Aristotelian; for 'we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> know that sweet Roman hand'). It is clear, accurate, convincing, complete. There is no more {{to be said about}} the matter, save that facts are stubborn things.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} that doesn't mind us," [...] he resumed presently. [...] "It isn't {{what we try}} to get that we get, it isn't the good we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> is good. What makes us happy isn't our trying, what makes others happy isn't our trying. There's a sort of character people like and stand up for and a sort they won't. You got to work it out and take the consequences.... Miriam was always trying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Harris, {{reaching}} {{his hand}} out for his glass, “we have had a pleasant trip, and my hearty thanks for it to old Father Thames—but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> well to chuck it when <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> Here’s to Three Men well out of a Boat!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's from Hetty Hume, and the English mail {{goes out}} to-day," [...] she said. [...] "She {{suggests}} that I should {{come over and}} spend a few months with her. I really <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> what <b>we</b> could for {{her when she was}} here with the Major." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in September 2000, the band was asked if they were surprised {{with the success of}} the song; [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> really well considering we're a new band, it's hard for people to accept new bands, and especially a track that we've written ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, very true," [...] cried Frank, [...] "very true. You {{want your}} neighbours' opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could {{ascertain}} what {{the chief of}} them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I {{do not know whether}} Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations {{of the rest of the}} people as any body. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> want a larger council. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> quite that, Dick. We {{walk from}} {{daylight}} to sunset, and often {{two or three}} hours by moonlight; and though we don't go very fast, we ought to get over a lot of ground. Listen! There is music!" [...] Both held their breath. [...] "Yes, there are the regular beats of a big drum. It is on the highroad, I should say, nearly abreast of us. If we go to that knoll we shall have a view of them; and there cannot be the least danger, as they must be fully a mile away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} his {{consequence}} very just and reasonable {{when you see}} him in his family, I assure you. I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> so well without him. He has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a house, and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs. Norris in order. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for Henry. I am sure Julia does not, or she would not have flirted as she did last night with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame," [...] he thundered, [...] "I {{have been}} {{receiving}} dancing-lessons at your hands for long enough. It is time, I <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a little ordinary walking, else shall we get no farther {{along the road}} I mean to go {{and that is the}} road to Paris with mademoiselle for company." ...|$|R
5000|$|On February 3, 2015, in a {{move that}} was {{described}} as symbolic, county commissioners voted unanimously to recommend FIU Stadium as a temporary home for the expansion team. Commissioner Juan C. Zapata, who sponsored the item, said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Beckham a big disservice. I know that when I've met with him, I have apologized, because I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could have treated him better." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "That we {{may never}} grow so proud as to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can <b>do</b> without God or religion" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't all a picnic," [...] remarked {{one of the}} unfortunates, as {{he leaped}} up out of a hole and shook himself like a big dog. [...] "Folks at home as just read the {{newspaper}} accounts of the war don't know anything of what us fellows {{have to put up}} with. All they <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> is to rush forward, kill the enemy, and cover ourselves with glory. I'll wager some of 'em would put on a mighty sour face if they had to tramp ten or twenty miles in the mud and wet, carry a gun and other luggage, and hardly knowing when the next meal was going to turn up and what it was going to amount to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "David," [...] he remarked, {{after we}} had marched {{for a long time}} beside that awful sea. [...] "David, I used to teach geology, and I thought that I {{believed}} what I taught; but now I see that I did not believe it--that it is impossible for man to believe such things as these unless he sees them with his own eyes. We take things for granted, perhaps, because we are told them over and over again, and have no way of disproving them--like religions, for example; but we don't believe them, we only <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> If you ever get back to the outer world you will find that the geologists and paleontologists {{will be the first to}} set you down a liar, for they know that no such creatures as they restore ever existed. It is all right to IMAGINE them as existing in an equally imaginary epoch--but now? poof!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Either America is {{healthier}} than Europe, notwithstanding her [...] "deadly" [...] indulgence in ice-water, {{or she does}} not keep the run of her death-rate as sharply as Europe does. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> keep up the death statistics accurately; and if we do, our cities are {{healthier than}} the cities of Europe. Every month the German government tabulates the death-rate {{of the world and}} publishes it. I scrap-booked these reports during several months, and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same death-rate month after month. The tables {{might as well have been}} stereotyped, they varied so little. These tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000 population for a year. Munich was always present with her 33 deaths in each 1,000 of her population (yearly average), Chicago was as constant with her 15 or 17, Dublin with her 48--and so on.|$|E
60|$|W.A.--Yes, yes, He {{knows and}} sees all things; He hears us speak, sees what <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> knows what <b>we</b> <b>think</b> though <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not speak.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{never heard}} any {{complaints}} about him, Mr. Thorndyke, except that I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> once {{hear from the}} Rector of the place that his conduct was not satisfactory. I remember that we wrote to him about it, {{and he said that}} the Rector was a malignant fellow, on bad terms with all his parishioners." ...|$|R
