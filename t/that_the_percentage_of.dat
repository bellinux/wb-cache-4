No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the First World War, Britain's economy enjoyed a brief boom. Businesses rushed to replenish stocks and re-establish peacetime conditions of trade, and while prices rose rapidly, wages rose faster and unemployment was negligible. By April 1920 this boom had given way to Britain's first post-war slump, which ushered in an era of high unemployment. Britain's adoption of generally deflationary economic policies, including a return to the gold standard in 1925, helped to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the workforce without jobs remained at around 10% for the rest of the 1920s and beyond, well above the normal pre-war levels. During the world recession that began in 1929 and lasted until 1932, the percentage of unemployed peaked at 22%, representing more than 3 million workers.|$|E

30|$|A PCA was {{performed}} on entries 1 - 5 before and after normalization to reference samples.

We also demonstrated that our normalization method affected RSD for each entry in metabolite-dependent manner (Additional file 3 : Table S 3). This suggests that before normalization to reference samples the observed variance was dominated by {{a smaller number of}} metabolites, whereas after normalization more metabolites contributed to the observed variance.|$|R

Likewise, in the Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, whose data was collected in 2012 and 2013, researchers noticed significant growth in the share of women who report bisexual orientation and attraction, and the share of men who report exclusive homosexual attraction, compared to the results of the First Australian Study of Health and Relationships, executed in 2001.|$|E
