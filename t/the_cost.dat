5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It {{has been suggested that}} innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of energy equation. He calculates <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of welding plays {{a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> of materials includes <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the base and filler material, and <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Although the {{clinical}} relevance of minor depression {{has been demonstrated}} in many studies, <b>the</b> economic <b>costs</b> are not well explored. In this study, we examine <b>the</b> economic <b>costs</b> of minor depression. Method: In a large-scale, population-based study in the Netherlands (n = 5504) <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of minor depression were compared with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of major depression and dysthymia. Excess <b>costs,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of a disorder over and above <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> attributable to other illnesses, were estimated with help of regression analysis. <b>The</b> direct medical <b>costs,</b> <b>the</b> direct non-medical <b>costs</b> and <b>the</b> indirect non-medical <b>costs</b> were calculated. <b>The</b> year 2003 {{was used as the}} reference year. Results: The annual per capita excess costs of minor depression were US$ 2141 (95 % CI = 753 - 3529) higher than <b>the</b> base rate <b>costs</b> of US$ 1023, while <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of major depression were US$ 3313 (95 % CI = 1234 - 5390) higher than the base rate. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of minor depression per 1 million inhabitants were 160 million dollars per year, which is somewhat less than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of major depression (192 million dollars per year). Conclusion: <b>The</b> economic <b>costs</b> associated with minor depression are considerable and approach those of major depression. Â© 2007 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|The most {{frequently}} occurring type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's {{disease is a}} degenerative illness affecting the brain, decreasing the patient's memory and judgement. A cure is not available {{but it is possible}} to delay the cognitive decline with medication. New drugs like Aricept and Metrifonate appear to have no or minor side effects and {{have a positive effect on}} the cognitive functions and behavior of the patient. At this moment the iMTA is studying the cost-effectiveness of Metrifonate. This thesis is part of that study and focuses on <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of Alzheimer's disease. The main question formulated in this thesis was: How do <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of institutionalization compare with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of living at home for patients with Alzheimer's disease in The Netherlands and France? For The Netherlands earlier studies on the use of health care services by demented patients were used to estimate <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for demented patients living at home. These <b>costs</b> depend on <b>the</b> amount of formal and informal health care services that demented patients use. The valuation of informal care also determines <b>the</b> amount of <b>costs</b> for patients living at home. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of living at home were compared with <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of institutionalization. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of demented patients living at home are lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of institutionalization when informal care is not valued. When <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of informal care are included in <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for patients living at home, these <b>costs</b> exceed <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of institutionalization for mildly demented patients as well as for severely demented patients by seven or more hours of informal care per day. A mildly demented patient probably does not need this amount of informal care per day. A severely demented patient could need seven hours of informal care per day. In that case costs of institutionalization are lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of living at home. In France admission of a mildly demented patient is cheaper when the patient needs more than two hours of informal care per day. As the severity of dementia increases, <b>the</b> increase in <b>costs</b> of institutionalization is not equal to <b>the</b> increase in <b>costs</b> of living at home. Therefore the thresholds at which <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of living at home exceed <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for institutionalization for a mildly demented patient does not equal the threshold for a severely demented patient. In comparison with <b>The</b> Netherlands, <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> for demented patients living at home in France are lower than in the Netherlands. This is caused by the increased use of informal care and the decreased use of professional health care services in France compared with <b>the</b> Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of institutionalization are also higher in the Netherlands than in France. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>the</b> French institutions are lower than <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of institutions in the Netherlands because the emphasis is more on the function of living than on the function of caring. When informal care is valued with the same tariff used in the Netherlands, admission of a severely demented patient needing more than seven hours of informal care per day is cheaper than living at home. This last mentioned threshold is comparable with the Netherlands...|$|R
