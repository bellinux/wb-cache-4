5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> general words were intended {{to be subject to}} the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E

25|$|In Singapore, where {{conviction}} {{rates for}} criminal offences are high, an acquittal {{is akin to}} the judiciary rejecting the executive's stand regarding a party’s guilt. Although {{it has been suggested}} that the low acquittal rate is evidence of a lack of judicial independence, it is also consistent with a stringent prosecution process that takes action only against persons who are manifestly guilty, such <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fair and independent-minded judge would decide to convict.|$|E

25|$|Ikeda {{explains}} that negative karma is subsumed {{in the world}} of Buddhahood and is purified by its power. Importantly, Soka Gakkai members believe effects are determined simultaneously with causes, though they remain latent until the right external influences bring them to fruition. Soka Gakkai Buddhism teaches <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> stubborn karma can be overcome as one reveals one's Buddha nature in this lifetime. Thus, karma becomes a source of hope and mission rather than despair.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} the {{correspondence}} theory {{is that there is}} a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to Neoplatonism and the philosopher Plotinus in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning. Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.|$|E
25|$|This {{concerns}} {{itself with}} fiery religious fanaticism stoked {{up by the}} sudden death of a loved one. The idea behind the song is <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> ardent supporter of peace can be drawn into violent conflict if their faith is shattered beyond repair. The title reflects the onset of spiritual darkness that pervades and eventually clouds the mind through irrevocable grief and irretrievable loss. Without sounding too political, one can draw a parallel with the current clime of terrorism, where normally peaceful religious groups are being incensed to hatred.|$|E

25|$|Arundel, {{along with}} Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, {{was at the}} very centre of Henry V's tight-knit group of advisers. The king's {{intervention}} in Shropshire in 1414 was a bold move designed to show <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful magnates were not above the law. It provoked the laying of almost 1800 indictments and the prosecution of about 1600 individuals. However, only seven were prosecuted {{as far as the}} requirement to give bonds for £200. Ultimately Arundel and Furnival stood surety for their affinity members and most received formal pardons.|$|E
25|$|Prospects for {{addition}} {{initiatives and}} legislation {{at the federal}} and state level appear mixed as of 2009. Former Federal Election Commission Chair Bradley A. Smith (who opposes compulsory unionism) has argued <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> stringent laws are unlikely to have any impact, as the number of agency fee payers is small compared to the number of union members. At least one legal scholar has questioned the constitutionality of paycheck protection laws, while another, detailed analysis of the Washington state effort has concluded that instead of decreasing the amount of union dues available for political expenditures paycheck protection actually increased it (from approximately $630,000 to approximately $780,000) as unions shifted member dues internally to account for the agency fees going toward collective bargaining.|$|E
25|$|More recently, it {{has become}} clear that the Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes are the most ancient groups of modern birds. It is possible, though not at all well-supported, that these were {{distinct}} {{by the end of the}} Albian 100 million years ago (Ma). Loons belong to a more modern radiation. They were once believed to be related to grebes, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both species were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes. However, as recently as the 1930s, it was determined that the two groups are not that closely related at all and are merely the product of convergent evolution and adapted in a similar way to a similar ecological niche. The similarity is so strong <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> modern cladistic analyses of general anatomical features are easily misled into grouping loons and grebes.|$|E
