25|$|During {{the three}} days of the second battle, EEF {{artillery}} aircraft flew 38 missions and engaged 63 targets. They located 27 batteries, despite difficulties identifying targets <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> and dust caused by the bombardment, and being attacked by hostile aircraft. Nevertheless, 128 direct hits were recorded by the artillery and three guns destroyed, while German and Ottoman anti-aircraft artillery caused the death of three pilots {{and the loss of}} two aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The 36-gun frigate Flora was patrolling off Brest on the {{afternoon}} of 10 August 1780 when <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> she sighted two vessels, a square-rigged vessel and a cutter, about four miles away. As Flora approached, the cutter edged away, while the square-rigged vessel waited, accepting battle. When the two ships were within two cables length the French ship raised her colours and opened fire. The battle lasted about an hour, until Flora, being much cut up, moved closer in. After another 15 minutes the French abandoned their guns and attempted to board, but were repulsed and the crew of Flora boarded her and took possession. She proved to be the frigate La Nymphe, pierced for 40 guns, but mounting only 32, and commanded by the Chevalier Charles-Marie de Trolong du Rumain, who died that evening of his wounds. Flora, as well as her nominal armament of 36 guns, also carried six recently-introduced 18-pounder carronades, which swept the decks of the French ship with grapeshot. In addition Floras guns were heavier, 18- and 9-pounders, against the French ship's 12- and 6-pounders. This is reflected in the number of casualties; 9 killed and 17 wounded on Flora out of a crew of 259, and 55 killed and 81 wounded aboard La Nymphe, from a crew of 291.|$|E
500|$|In the {{intervening}} time, a few skirmishes {{took place between}} RAF fighters and German reconnaissance aircraft. A Lehrgeschwader 2 (LG 2) Bf 110 was shot down in the morning. At 11:00 [...] 1's formations took off and the main formations headed out to sea. The form-up was more difficult for KG 76 and its Do 17s and Ju 88s. Their bases in and around Calais were covered in 8/10ths cloud cover with a base of 6,500 feet which reached to 10,000 feet. As the bombers climbed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> the formation soon lost cohesion. Valuable time was lost as they reformed. The Do 17s of I. and III./KG 76 had overtaken the III./KG 76 Ju 88s which should have been ahead of them by five minutes. These delay had serious consequences for 9 Staffel KG 76.|$|E

500|$|The Austrians were {{astonished}} at the Prussian appearance on their left flank. The objective was soon clear: the Prussian infantry, now arrayed {{in the conventional}} two lines of battle, advanced on the weakest part of the Austrian line, intending to roll up the flank. [...] The Austrian colonels on the scene did the best they could: by turning their own lines 90 degrees, they tried {{to take advantage of}} a shallow ditch facing the Prussian line. Franz Leopold von Nádasdy, commanding the flank, asked Charles for support, a request the Prince ignored: even at late morning, with most of the Prussian army on his left flank, he still believed that any attack would come at the northern flank. [...] Most of the men in the first Austrian line were Württembergers, Protestant troops whose willingness to fight the Lutheran Prussians had been called into question by the Austrian command. The Württembergers held out, maintaining steady musket fire until the mass of Prussians emerged <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> of gunpowder. Then they ran for their lives, sweeping the Bavarians Nádasdy had deployed to support his flank with them.|$|E

Gneisenau was hit by a bomb which failed to explode and was moved from dry dock to the outer harbour, where it was photographed by a 1 PRU Spitfire on 5 April. Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers attacked at dawn next day and one aircraft found the harbour <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>haze</b> and torpedoed Gneisenau in the stern. The ship was docked again and on the night of [...] Bomber Command achieved four hits and two near-misses; Scharnhorst was not damaged but the bomb hits on the docks delayed its refit. Along with the mines dropped in the vicinity, the ships were not available for Unternehmen Rheinübung (Operation Rhine Exercise), in which the battleship Bismarck was sunk in the north Atlantic. The Hipper-class cruiser Prinz Eugen survived and arrived at Brest on 1 June.|$|E
