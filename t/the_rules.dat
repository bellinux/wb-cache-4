5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rules</b> {{of chess}} (also {{known as the}} laws of chess) are rules {{governing}} the {{play of the game}} of chess.

Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes.

40|$|Formal {{conceptions of}} <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law are popular among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers. Nonetheless, the coherence of accounts of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law committed to these conceptions is sometimes fractured by elements harkening back to substantive conceptions of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law. I {{suggest that this}} may be because at its origins the ideal of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law was substantive through and through. I also argue that those origins are older than is generally supposed. Most authors tend to trace the ideas of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because the founding moment of the tradition of western intellectual reflection on <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law placed concerns about substantive justice at the centre of <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given the rhetorical power of appeals to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> of law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law...|$|R

5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common.
