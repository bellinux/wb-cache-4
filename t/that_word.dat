The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with <b>that</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning <b>that</b> <b>word</b> order in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E

5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue <b>that</b> <b>word</b> learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest <b>that</b> <b>word</b> learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E

5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of <b>that</b> <b>word</b> in spoken language.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{question}} the almost universal assumption <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are signs. I first offer an interpretation of that assumption, which links it to the so-called thesis of the arbitrariness of the sign. I then draw out and explain one key commitment of the assumption, on that interpretation. This commitment of the view <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are signs appears to be open to an obvious objection, which I briefly explain. 1. What Everyone Assumes Almost everyone assumes <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are signs, although they often do so without noticing. Some hesitate a little before openly endorsing the assumption—either because they have a very particular understanding of what signs are, or because, once they are consider the assumption explicitly, they find they are not sure what signs are at all. But those who hesitate because they have a particular understanding of the notion of a sign are usually prepared to accept something a little looser or more contextualized, such as that languages (as wholes) are systems of signs; for my present purposes I will count such looser or more contextualized assumptions as just versions of the assumption <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are signs, and will take the assumption <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are signs itself as being to be understood in some suitabl...|$|R

25|$|Both in Ido and in Esperanto, {{each word}} is built from a root word. A word {{consists}} of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from <b>that</b> <b>word</b> by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain affixes between the root and the grammatical ending.|$|E
25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of <b>that</b> <b>word</b> was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of <b>that</b> <b>word</b> was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E
