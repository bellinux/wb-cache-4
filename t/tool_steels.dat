5|$|Most {{high-strength}} steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used {{each year in}} stainless steels, <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

5|$|Vanadium occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed <b>tool</b> <b>steels.</b> The most important industrial vanadium compound, vanadium pentoxide, {{is used as a}} catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E

30|$|Different {{types of}} wood milling tools {{are used in}} industry: solid tools [made of alloy <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> (SP), high-alloyed <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> (HL) or {{high-speed}} <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> (HS)] and built-on hard alloy blades or different high wear resistance coatings. Shank of built-on tool is made of high carbon or alloy <b>tool</b> <b>steel,</b> while cutting edge is produced of stellites (ST) or plates of tungsten carbide (HW). The cutting edge of more advanced tools is made of polycrystalline (PKD) or monocrystalline (MKD) diamonds. Solid cutting tools are generally used for natural wood milling, planning and profiling contain chromium (Cr) as the main alloying element. Chemical composition of <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> plays {{an essential role in}} both tool performance and final quality of wood product.|$|R
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from <b>tool</b> <b>steels,</b> but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E

25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edgeâ€“chip interface. When one considers that high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon <b>tool</b> <b>steels</b> do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|E
500|$|The dabber {{variation}} {{is used to}} precisely place weld metal on thin edges. [...] The automatic process replicates the motions of manual welding by feeding a cold or hot filler wire into the weld area and dabbing (or oscillating) it into the welding arc. [...] It {{can be used in}} conjunction with pulsed current, and is used to weld a variety of alloys, including titanium, nickel, and <b>tool</b> <b>steels.</b> [...] Common applications include rebuilding seals in jet engines and building up saw blades, milling cutters, drill bits, and mower blades.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] <b>Tool</b> <b>steels</b> should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conventionally {{manufactured}} {{cold work}} <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> {{is often used}} in sheet metal forming as die material. Due to the forging process, the as-cast network structure of carbides is broken into elongated particles. Depending on the tool cross-section, the orientation and shape of carbides in the active tool surface is different. In the present research, the influence of <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> hard phase orientation and shape on galling was investigated. D 2 type <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> was cut in three different orientations and tested in lubricated sliding conditions against AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel. Tests were performed using a Slider-On-Flat-Surface and galling was detected by changes in friction and post-test microscopy. The lubricant was Castrol FST 8 using 5 g/m 2 sheet material. Results showed {{a strong correlation between}} sliding distance to galling and <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> hard phase orientation and shape at low loads, whereas high load contact resulted in early galling in all cases. Material transfer was observed mainly to the <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> matrix. The worst performance was observed for specimens cut so that the <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> hard phase, M 7 C 3 carbides in the D 2 steel, were oriented along the sliding direction, which resulted in longer open tool matrix areas contacting the sheet material...|$|R
40|$|Thermal fatigue {{performance}} of direct metal deposited H 13 <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> coating on copper alloy substrate was investigated for high {{pressure die casting}} applications. An innovative thermal fatigue test rig was used which is capable of applying cyclic identical energy on the test materials regardless of thermal conductivity property. H 13 <b>tool</b> <b>steel</b> was coated on cylindrical copper alloy core material both directly as well as using 316 stainless steel as a buffer layer to evaluate and compare their thermal fatigue properties. Two types of cracks at the surface of both coatings were observed and investigated.
