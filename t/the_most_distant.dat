5|$|New {{developments}} {{since the}} 2000s include {{the recognition of}} short gamma-ray bursts as a separate class (likely from merging neutron stars and not associated with supernovae), the discovery of extended, erratic flaring activity at X-ray wavelengths lasting for many minutes after most GRBs, and {{the discovery of the}} most luminous (GRB 080319B) and the former most distant (GRB 090423) objects in the universe. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> known GRB, GRB 090429B, is now <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> known object in the universe.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for {{the early}} {{appearance}} of galaxies was found in 2006, when {{it was discovered that}} the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high redshift of 6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making it <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> and primordial galaxy yet seen.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{used the}} word planēton {{to refer to the}} seven {{celestial}} bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies moved about the Earth. In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> object moved the slowest.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> and coldest {{objects in the}} Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|Nouvelles Extraordinaires, {{like other}} {{newspapers}} of its time, gave primarily political and commercial information, classified by source and {{date of arrival}} (the oldest, from <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> lands, coming first). It offered reports on international politics, such as wars and diplomatic relations, as well as coverage of major domestic affairs. The newspaper also contained trivia, editorials and advertising. Like many other early newspapers, it offered judgments and prognostications, {{and was in the}} main a juxtaposition of rumors and announcements from various sources, presented without much unification.|$|E

Estonians of the Soviet rifle corps murdered their compatriots that had been taken prisoner at Porkuni and the wounded sheltering in the Avinurme Parish church.|$|E
5|$|The British 1st Airborne Division was {{tasked with}} {{securing}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> objectives; bridges over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem. The division dropped onto the area on 17 September {{and a small}} force was able to secure the Arnhem road bridge. However the unexpected presence of SS Panzer troops of the II SS Panzerkorps meant the Allies {{were never able to}} fully secure their objectives and so after nine days without sufficient reinforcement by the advancing ground forces, the division was withdrawn on 25 September.|$|E
5|$|The Gallic {{group are}} four {{prograde}} outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distance from the planet (207–302 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclination (35–40°) and their color {{that they can be}} considered a group.

5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful as a standard candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than expected. This has provided evidence that {{the expansion of the universe}} may be accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Within the constellation's borders lie NGC 2419, {{an unusually}} remote {{globular}} cluster; the galaxy NGC 2770, which has hosted three recent Type Ib supernovae; the distant quasar APM 08279+5255, whose light is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing {{effect of a}} foreground galaxy; and the Lynx Supercluster, which was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> supercluster known {{at the time of}} its discovery in 1999.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new {{window on the}} early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery of some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E

50|$|IOK-1 is {{a distant}} galaxy in the {{constellation}} Coma Berenices. When discovered in 2006, it was <b>the</b> oldest and <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> galaxy ever found, at redshift 6.96.|$|R
5|$|As the Universe expands, {{more distant}} objects recede from the Earth faster, {{in what is}} called the Hubble Flow. The light from very distant galaxies is {{significantly}} affected by the cosmological redshift. While quasars with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced. The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion light-years. Due to redshift <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> objects in the HDF (Lyman-break galaxies) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant,</b> high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|Outside Mars, Jupiter {{was first}} visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, {{and became the}} first {{spacecraft}} to orbit the planet. Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the radio galaxy 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|Routes22 and 55 {{continue}} their long curve {{into the town}} of Dover, past the Harlem Valley–Wingdale station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. The NY55 concurrency ends when that road heads towards Connecticut at Wingdale. The road continues through Dover Plains and into Amenia, where an overlap with NY343 begins. The railroad line ends at Wassaic, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> Metro-North station from the city in direct miles. Route343 remains joined with Route22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards state line. At the same junction, US44 comes in from Millbrook to begin an overlap with Route22. The valley opens up as the southern Taconics loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of North East, the highway passes by the large Coleman Station Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>distant</b> objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
