5|$|Two {{additional}} realignments {{occurred at}} the north end of the Green Line, but with less acrimony. North of Fort Totten, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, I-95, and proceeded to a point just west of Prince George's Plaza, with an intermediate station at Chillum. I-95 and Metro would have run through the Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park; the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the Beltway in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro (as well as a Metro station and its parking lot). WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named West Hyattsville. The other alignment dispute occurred in the Petworth section of Washington, and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt Rock Creek Cemetery and how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> soft-soil burial ground (it was skirted using the New Austrian Tunnelling method), and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from Georgia Avenue – Petworth to Columbia Heights (the tunnels were stacked).|$|E
25|$|Although {{heads of}} {{government}} {{have the power}} to suspend member states from active participation, the Commonwealth has no provision for the expulsion of members. Until 2007, Commonwealth realms that became republics automatically ceased to be members, until (like India in 1950) they obtained the permission of other members to remain in the organisation. This policy has been changed, so if any current Commonwealth realms were to become republics, they would not have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> process.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Bosnia {{in the western}} Balkans during the Dark Ages is patchy. Upon the looter invasions by the Avars and Slavs from 6th-9th century, bringing Slavic languages, both probably gave way to feudalism only with the might by the Frankish penetrating into {{the region in the}} late 9th century (Bosnia probably originated as one such pre-feudal entity). It was also around this time that the Bosnians were Christianized. Bosnia, due to its geographic position and terrain, {{was probably one of the}} last areas <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast.|$|E

500|$|Written by David A. Goodman, and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino, series creator Seth MacFarlane {{came up with the}} idea for the episode while writing a pilot episode featuring two gay men.

MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat {{the shit out of}} her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode debuted {{the series}} as a midseason {{replacement}} for the 2004–05 season. The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the British version. Daniels had decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> route because [...] "completely starting from scratch {{would be a very}} risky thing to do" [...] due to the show being an adaptation. Although the episode was primarily adapted from the first episode of the British series, it was partially re-scripted in an attempt to [...] "Americanize" [...] it. [...] Jokes such as Dwight's stapler being put in Jell-O by Jim were transferred verbatim from the original series, while others were only slightly changed. [...] Although later reshot, a scene in which Jim tapes pencils to his desk was originally filmed as a parallel to a scene in the British version, in which Tim Canterbury stacks up cardboard boxes in front of Gareth Keenan to restrict Keenan's view of Canterbury. [...] "Pilot" [...] was filmed almost six months prior to beginning of filming on the second episode of the season, [...] "Diversity Day". The Office used no laugh tracks in the [...] "Pilot", wanting its [...] "deadpan" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] humor to fully come across.|$|E

2500|$|While at Rochester, Ashkin was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to formally {{recognize the importance of}} the Feynman diagram. Feynman devised the diagram in 1948 to provide a simple visualization of the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles. Although the diagram and its offshoots were later seen as extremely important tools, Feynman did not give them a theoretical framework nor did he explain how he proposed they be used. Physicists had difficulty in understanding their function, distrusted their simplicity, and were reluctant to give them formal recognition. Feynman later said physicists did not realize the diagram's power and would employ a more complex method created by Julian Schwinger. Ashkin, he said, {{was the first}} to break with this pattern: [...] "They somehow or other couldn’t do it. They had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> [...] to believe it. But that's all right. The only person who didn't, the first paper where it was used directly — which I kept looking for, I kept flipping through the Physical Review as it came out — was Ashkin. He'd done some calculation for some experiment, and he said, 'We’ve calculated this using Feynman's rules.' Bloop! There it was in writing! Then gradually more and more people did it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cast and}} crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an {{isolated}} set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, [...] "I knew {{this was going to}} be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ever want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> again". For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely. Actor Leo Burmester said, [...] "Shooting The Abyss has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself." [...] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank. Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night. In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.|$|E
