5|$|The film {{score was}} written by English {{musician}} and composer David Julyan. Julyan had previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on Following, Memento and Insomnia.

5|$|Without career {{prospects}} {{outside of}} sport, Wills joined the MCC {{as a professional}} {{at the start of}} the 1867–68 season; however, he was not openly referred to as such.

5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of the award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> {{of winning}} the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a {{resolution}} {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology took on <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> {{of elite}} {{knowledge}} that marks its possessors {{as belonging to}} a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a {{military}} threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to the decline of <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E

5|$|General Germanus died {{in battle}} against the Persians. An army sent by Phocas against Khosrow was {{defeated}} near Dara in Upper Mesopotamia, leading to the capture of that important fortress in 605. Narses escaped from Leontius, the eunuch appointed by Phocas to deal with him, but when Narses attempted to return to Constantinople to discuss peace terms, Phocas ordered him seized and burned alive. The death of Narses along with the failure to stop the Persians damaged <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of Phocas' military regime.|$|E
5|$|In England, Anne largely {{turned from}} {{political}} {{to social and}} artistic activities. Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced {{in the course}} of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City (1971), Hawaii (1977), Vienna (1983) and Athens (1989). The campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was a key episode in the Cold War, inflicting irretrievable damage on <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of medicine in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E
5|$|The award {{show has}} long been a central point of the film festival, as well as a major {{television}} event for the whole of Norway. Particularly in earlier years, international stars were sometimes brought in to enhance <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of the event. Examples of this are Roger Moore, who was a special guest at the very first ceremony in 1985, and Diana Ross in 1987, then married to Norwegian entrepreneur Arne Næss, Jr. Other international names appearing in the show as presenters have included Ned Beatty, Lauren Bacall, Jon Voight, Brian Cox, Jeremy Irons, Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan.|$|E

5|$|The {{occupation}} of France during the Second World War tarnished <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> {{of the colonial}} administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the Malagasy Uprising of 1947. This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with {{the adoption of a}} constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it was}} a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of each territory, or they may represent an early example of book-keeping. Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrive at}} the planet and travel to an {{underground}} vault which had been ransacked. As {{they are about to}} leave, Worf discovers a secret chamber containing the sword. They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras who had hired the Lethean and wants the sword for <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit, they head into the adjoining cave system {{in order to try to}} get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons begin to be affected by <b>the</b> <b>prestige</b> of the sword. Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses to let go of the sword. Worf grabs the other end of the sword, and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up.|$|E
