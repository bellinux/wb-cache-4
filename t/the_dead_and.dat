5|$|An infant's new tooth {{is celebrated}} with bowls of {{sweetened}} wheat or barley and sweets served after a child's circumcision include baklava and Burma. Christian families in mourning serve a sweet bun known as rahmeh. It is a food eaten in remembrance of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> {{as a gesture}} of blessing the soul of the deceased person. The Greek Orthodox Church offer a special tray with cooked wheat covered with sugar and candy after a memorial service.|$|E
5|$|Attica is a war-torn city {{under assault}} by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, {{and is the}} site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, Morpheus. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has {{plummeted}} to Earth in Helios' absence. Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton. The Underworld is the underground realm of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, Charon. Tartarus is the prison of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> the Titans where the massive Titan Hyperion is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.|$|E

50|$|Death: When {{a person}} dies, {{couriers}} travel throughout the hamlets, chanting {{the name of}} <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> <b>The</b> relatives <b>and</b> the neighbors sprinkle coriander mixed with water on <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> body <b>and</b> a coin is pasted on <b>the</b> forehead. <b>The</b> <b>dead</b> body is completely covered with a white cloth {{and placed in a}} bamboo cot. The people who come for the burial service resolve any problems they had with <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> person <b>and</b> thus he is expected to be completely freed for his eternal journey.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the summer}} of 2016, Defeated Sanity {{confirmed}} work on a new release, which is a two part full-length album with one side titled Disposal of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>and</b> the other titled Dharmata.

5|$|Four U.S. {{soldiers}} were killed within the first 20 minutes of the battle, another died later, and at least three others were wounded.

5|$|Jesus Christ is {{the only}} Son of God the Father. For the sake of {{humanity}} and its salvation, he became flesh, lived on earth and was crucified, died and was buried; rose from <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> ascended to heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father.|$|E
40|$|A new {{dead time}} {{compensation}} scheme that can exactly estimate <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> time <b>and</b> inverter nonlinearity under parameter variations is proposed for a PWM inverter-fed PMSM drive. The proposed scheme uses {{the fact that}} the sixth harmonic component in total disturbance estimated under the presence of various uncertainties is mainly caused by <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> time <b>and</b> inverter nonlinearity. The total disturbance due to the parameter variations as well as <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> time <b>and</b> inverter nonlinearity is estimated by the adaptive scheme. The sixth harmonic component is extracted from this total disturbance through harmonic analysis. The obtained sixth harmonic is processed by the PI controller to estimate the disturbance caused by <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> time <b>and</b> inverter nonlinearity in the stationary reference frame. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified. Without requiring an additional hardware, the proposed scheme can effectively compensate <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> time <b>and</b> inverter nonlinearit...|$|R

5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings {{he seems to have}} considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> <b>and</b> organ music.|$|E

5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} was {{a deadly}} munitions explosion that occurred on July 17, 1944, at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Port Chicago, California, United States. Munitions detonated while being loaded onto a cargo vessel {{bound for the}} Pacific Theater of Operations, killing 320 sailors and civilians and injuring 390 others. Most of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> injured were enlisted African American sailors.|$|E

5|$|Yama, as Lord of Justice, {{is called}} Dharma-raja. Yama sends the virtuous to Svarga {{to enjoy the}} luxuries of paradise. He also assesses the vices of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> accords judgement, {{assigning}} them to appropriate hells as punishment commensurate with the severity and nature of their sins. A person is not freed of samsara (the cycle of birth-death-rebirth) and must take birth again after his prescribed pleasure in Svarga or punishment in Naraka is over.|$|E
5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. <b>The</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> wounded of Grant's army {{lay in the}} heat of Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
5|$|A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa Donovan (Alice Kremelberg), is {{declared}} brain dead at {{a hospital}} and is pulled off life support. While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes back from <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> yells highly classified naval missile codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes are tied to a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E

5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> <b>and</b> cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> <b>and,</b> in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>and</b> reads a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E
