5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

500|$|Other bands were {{becoming}} regulars at CBGB, such as Mink DeVille and Talking Heads, which moved down from Rhode Island, {{as well as}} [...] Cleveland, Ohio's The Dead Boys. More closely associated with Max's Kansas City were Suicide and the band led by Jayne County, another Mercer Arts Center alumna. The first album <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> downtown scene was released in November 1975: Smith's debut, Horses, produced by John Cale for the major Arista label. The inaugural issue of Punk appeared in December. The new magazine tied together earlier artists such as Velvet Underground lead singer Lou Reed, the Stooges, and the New York Dolls with the editors' favorite band, the Dictators, and the array of new acts centered on CBGB and Max's. That winter, Pere Ubu came in from Cleveland and played at both spots.|$|E
2500|$|Kurt von Schuschnigg, son of {{the former}} Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria Kurt Schuschnigg, served as an officer cadet on Prinz Eugen {{under the command of}} Reinicke. According to his account, Von Schuschnigg met Reinicke, whom he {{described}} as a [...] "decent man who was certain <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> war badly" [...] in a one-to-one conversation. Von Schuschnigg also witnessed the execution by firing squad of another cadet on Prinz Eugen who had been sentenced to death for cowardice {{in the face of the}} enemy. The cadet had fallen asleep while on active duty, and according to German military law at the time, this was punishable by death.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush vowed {{to rebuild the}} World Trade Center site.

We're going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{stronger}} than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again." [...] During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of cleanup workers through a megaphone. An individual in the crowd shouted, [...] "I can't hear you," [...] to which Bush replied, [...] "I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 31, 2010, George {{announced}} that he would forgo his final two seasons of college eligibility at Fresno State and enter the 2010 NBA draft. He made his first appearance on a 2010 mock draft on Draft Express a month into his sophomore season. By May 2010, mock drafts such as Draft Express, ESPN.com, and The Hoops Report predicted that George would be selected 12th overall by the Memphis Grizzlies. Two days before the draft, Marc J. Spears from Yahoo! Sports wrote an article about an anonymous Eastern Conference scout stating that [...] "in five years, Paul George will be the best player <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> draft". Hoping to draft Derrick Favors, the Pacers had discussed a draft trade with the Nets that would have sent Danny Granger and the 10th pick to the Nets for Devin Harris, Yi Jianlian and the 3rd overall pick, but the deal fell through. George was invited to sit in the green room during the draft and was selected tenth overall by the Indiana Pacers. He became the highest NBA draft pick in Fresno State history. On July 1, 2010, he signed his rookie contract with the Pacers; a two-year guaranteed deal worth $3.9 million, with team options for a third and fourth year.|$|E

A few oil lamps gave a feeble light here and there. At present he had formed no plan whatever of detecting the thieves; he was as much puzzled as the Captain himself as to how the goods could have been removed. It would be necessary, of course, to watch the apprentices, but he did not think that anything was likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> It was the warehouse itself that must be watched, in order to discover how the thieves made an entry. His own idea was that they got over the wall by means of a rope, and in some way managed to effect an entry into the warehouse. The apprentices could hardly aid them unless they came down through the house.|$|E
