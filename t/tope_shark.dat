50|$|The common smooth-hound has a grey-brown {{back and}} is white on its underneath. It is often {{confused}} with the starry smooth-hound which has white spots on its back. The starry smooth-hound can often have faded spots which leads to misidentification. Another shark it is often confused with is the <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> although the common smooth hound has a larger second dorsal fin. Due to {{the similarities between the}} common smooth-hound and other sharks, misidentification occurred for a long time.|$|E
5000|$|The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) is a houndshark of {{the family}} Triakidae, and {{the only member of}} the genus Galeorhinus. Common names also include <b>tope</b> <b>shark,</b> soupfin shark, and snapper shark. It is found {{worldwide}} in temperate seas at depths down to about 800 m. It can grow to nearly 2 m long. It feeds both in midwater and near the seabed, and its reproduction is ovoviviparous. This shark is caught in fisheries for its flesh, its fins, and its liver, which has a very high vitamin A content. The IUCN has classified this species as [...] "vulnerable" [...] in its Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
40|$|During 1994 – 96, an {{experimental}} longline fishery for <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> (Galeorhinus galeus) {{was carried out}} in the Nuevo Gulf of northern Patagonia and, in the summers of 2000 – 2001 and 2002, three boats conducted an exploratory commercial fishery for this species, accompanied by a scientific monitoring program. This paper summarizes the results of these fishing trials, and provides information on the biology of <b>tope</b> <b>shark.</b> Catches were highest from February to April, when <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> represented 36 % of the total fish caught, and elephant fish (Callorhynchus callorhynchus) and argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) accounted for 33 % and 23 %, respectively. <b>Tope</b> <b>shark</b> arriving in northern Patagonian waters during the summer are primarily mature males, immature and maturing females in their first and second non-gravid year. No gravid females were caught. These fish are part of the South-western Atlantic stock, which shows signs of over-exploitation, so we suggest that any longline fishery in Patagonia should remain on a small scale. We also recommend that an effective management plan is needed for the whole tope stock, establishing agreements on effort control and co-ordinated research betwee...|$|E

5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and <b>tope</b> <b>sharks</b> (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|R
2500|$|Galeus, {{derived from}} the Greek galeos meaning [...] "shark", {{is one of the}} oldest carcharhiniform generic names. It was first used in a {{binomial}} by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in his 1810 Caratteri di alcuni nuovi generi e nuove specie di animali (principalmente di pesci) e piante della Sicilia: con varie osservazioni sopra i medesimi. Rafinesque listed G. melastomus, G. vulpecula (=Alopias vulpinus), G. mustelus (=Mustelus mustelus), and G. catulus (=Scyliorhinus canicula). Subsequently, in 1816 Georges Cuvier used Galeus to refer to the genus presently known as Galeorhinus, and in 1818 William Elford Leach used Galeus to refer to genus presently known as Mustelus. As a result, 19th century authors generally used Galeus for the <b>tope</b> <b>sharks,</b> and Pristiurus, coined by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1834, for the sawtail catsharks.|$|R
40|$|A {{vertebrae}} {{sample of}} <b>tope</b> <b>shark,</b> Galeorhinus galeus (Linnaeus, 1758), stratified by sizeclasses,was {{used to test}} between different staining techniques of enhancing vertebral growth ring visibility. Four techniques were tested: alizarin red, silver nitrate and cobalt nitrate staining, and the “deep-coned vertebrae” technique. The latter was discarded due to its unsuitability for <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> vertebrae. The cobalt nitrate original protocol was modified. Upon staining, each vertebra was subject to three replicated independent readings, by a single reader. Within-reader consistency and bias of growth ring counts determination were evaluated using four different precision indices: percent of agreement (PA), average percent error (APE), coefficient of variation (V) and index of precision (D). Results indicated that the vertebrae stained with the cobalt nitrate technique showed both better optic enhancement of growth rings and higher degree of count consistency, comparatively to the alizarin red and silver stained vertebrae. Conclusively, the cobalt nitrate was the most efficient staining technique upon <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> vertebrae, among the methods tested herein...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tope</b> <b>shark</b> (Galeorhinus galeus) and {{thornback ray}} (Raja clavata) {{are the two}} most {{captured}} elasmobranch species by the Azorean bottom longline fishery. In order to better understand the trophic dynamics of these species in the Azores, the diets of thornback ray and <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> caught in this area during 1996 and 1997 were analyzed to describe feeding patterns and to investigate the effect of sex, size, and depth and area of capture on diet. Thornback rays fed mainly upon fishes and reptants, but also upon polychaetes, mysids, natant crustaceans, isopods, and cephalopods. In the Azores, this species preyed more heavily upon fish compared with the predation patterns described in other areas. Differences in the diet may be due to differences in the environments (e. g. in the Azores, seamounts and oceanic islands are the major topographic features, whereas in all other studies, continental shelves have been the major topographic feature). No differences were observed in the major prey consumed between the sexes or between size classes (49 − 60, 61 − 70, 71 − 80, and 81 − 93 cm TL). Our study indicates that rays inhabiting different depths and areas (coastal or offshore banks) prey upon different resources. This appears {{to be related to the}} relative abundance of prey with habitat. Tope sharks were found to prey almost exclusively upon teleost fish: small shoaling fish, mainly boarfish (Capros aper) and snipefish (Macroramphosus scolopax), were the most frequent prey. This study illustrates that thornback rays and tope sharks are top predators in waters off the Azores...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} trace their feeding habits, stable carbon and {{nitrogen}} isotope ratios (d 15 N and d 13 C), {{as well as}} trace metal concentrations (Zn, Cd, Fe, Cu, Se and Hg) were analysed in the tissues of five commercial shark species from the Celtic Sea: the <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> Galeorhinus galeus, the black-mouthed catshark Galeus melastomus, the starry smooth hound Mustelus asterias, the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias and the lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. Our results were compared to previously described stomach contents and isotopic composition of potential preys. Isotopic ratio d 15 N suggested that tope sharks fed at a higher trophic level (16. 7 ‰ in the muscle) than the other species, reflecting its piscivorous diet. The lower values of spiny dogfish (11. 6 ‰ in the muscle) might be explained, amongst other things, by either its migratory behaviour or its preference for preys from lower trophic levels. Cd and Hg were correlated with isotopic ratios d 13 C and d 15 N, and were shown to be diet-related whereas Zn, Fe and Cu seemed much more linked to species-specific metabolism. Although this multidisciplinary approach is revealed as {{a useful tool for}} the study of shark ecology, the lack of known trophic fractionation suggests that isotopic data be compared to traditional diet analyses...|$|E
40|$|A Pilot Action of Exploratory Fishing {{was carried}} out {{in the second half of}} 2001 by two Spanish bottom-longline {{commercial}} fishing vessels within the Uruguayan Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) targeting deep-water species. Trap fishing gears were also utilised as another alternative fishing gears. The main objective of the exploratory survey was to improve the knowledge of the distribution and the population structure of the species target of the survey: Groupers (Epinephelus spp.), Kingclip (Genypterus blacodes), Brazilian sandperch (Pinguipes spp.) and other accompanying species. Some preliminary results of this exploratory survey are shown in this current work. Fishery and biological data were collected by scientific observers on board of the two vessels which took part in the exploratory fishing. The collected data were date, time, position, depth, SST, SBT, weather condition, catches, discards, length distributions, sex, maturity, stomach fullness… among others. Length distributions, sex ratio and maturity stage of the most abundant species in the catch are also shown. Catch, effort and CPUE by area, gear and depth strata were analysed. Regarding bottom longline gear, the most abundant species were Dogfish shark (Squalus sp), Wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), <b>Tope</b> <b>shark</b> (Galeorhinus galeus) and Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) in waters shallower than 200 m depth.

40|$|Exploitation {{of sharks}} by both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries has caused decreasing numbers resulting in population collapses. Sharks are extremely {{vulnerable to the}} effects of exploitation due to life-history characteristics including long lifespans, low fecundities, and late maturities. One family of shark, the Triakidae, {{has been the subject of}} global exploitation for greater than 80 years, especially within the eastern Pacific. The Triakidae is a primary component of the eastern Pacific elasmobranch assemblage considered both commercially and recreationally important with several endemic species found within the region including Mustelus albipinnis, M. californicus, M. dorsalis, M. henlei, M. lunulatus, and Triakis semifasciata. In regards to conservation efforts, there is a general paucity of information regarding the status of triakid sharks. As a result of this paucity of information, this study used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers to investigate: 1) gene flow among globally distributed populations of the <b>tope</b> <b>shark,</b> Galeorhinus galeus; 2) determine the existence of multiple paternity in M. henlei from within the northern portion of the species' range; and, 3) explore the population connectivity of M. henlei among localities distributed throughout the range of the species from along the northeastern Pacific coast. A lack of gene flow among globally distributed populations of the <b>tope</b> <b>shark,</b> G. galeus from North America, South America, Western Europe, South Africa, and Australia has been observed based on data from thirteen species-specific microsatellite loci. These data support previous patterns of gene flow based on mitochondrial control region sequence data and indicate the isolated nature of globally distributed populations of G. galeus. As a result, these populations should be managed separately and the currently recognized species status of G. galeus as monotypic should be reconsidered. The existence of polyandry and multiple paternity within a population of M. henlei at Santa Catalina Island, CA over a period of eight years has been confirmed based on data from 18 litters and four species-specific microsatellites. The observed range of multiple paternity, 0 - 40 %, is significantly lower than that observed in another population of M. henlei from Baja California (93 % of 14 litters were observed to be sired by multiple males within a single year). As population sizes differ between the two localities (Baja California > Santa Catalina Island), the rate at which females encounter mates may be responsible for the difference in the frequencies of multiple paternity observed between Santa Catalina Island and Baja California. Data from six species-specific microsatellites and the mitochondrial control region have detected three distinct populations of M. henlei in the northeastern Pacific (Northern (San Francisco), Central (Santa Barbara, CA, Santa Catalina Island, CA, Punta Lobos, Baja California, Mexico, and San Felipe, Baja California, Mexico), and Southern (Costa Rica)). Reduced mitochondrial genetic diversity was observed in San Francisco and Santa Catalina relative to all other localities. Possible reasons for the observed reductions in genetic diversity may be the recent establishment of isolated populations after Pleistocene glaciations, female philopatry to nursery areas, or a combination of the two. Long-term gene flow was asymmetric among localities with the predominating pattern being from the north to the south. Gene flow within the past two to three generations appears to be virtually nonexistent among localities with the exception of Punta Lobos that demonstrated significant gene flow to all other localities within the central population. This pattern may be the result of changing climate and may reflect the dispersal of tropical M. henlei into subtropical and temperate regions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>tope</b> <b>shark</b> (Galeorhinus galeus Linnaeus, 1758) is a temperate, coastal hound shark {{found in}} the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans. In this study, the {{population}} structure of Galeorhinus galeus was determined across the entire Southern Hemisphere, where the species is heavily targeted by commercial fisheries, as well as locally, along the South African coastline. Analysis was conducted on a total of 185 samples using 19 microsatellite markers and a 671 bp fragment of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND 2) gene. Across the Southern Hemisphere, three geographically distinct clades were recovered, including one from South America (Argentina, Chile), one from Africa (all the South African collections) and an Australia-New Zealand clade. Nuclear data revealed significant population subdivisions (FST = 0. 192 to 0. 376, p< 0. 05) indicating limited gene flow for tope sharks across ocean basins. Marked population connectivity was however evident across the Indian Ocean based on Bayesian clustering analysis. More locally in South Africa, F-statistics and multivariate analysis supported moderate to high gene flow across the Atlantic/Indian Ocean boundary (FST = 0. 035 to 0. 044, p< 0. 05), with exception of samples from Struisbaai and Port Elizabeth which differed significantly from the rest. Discriminant and Bayesian clustering analysis indicated admixture in all sampling populations, decreasing from west to east, corroborating possible restriction to gene flow across regional oceanographic barriers. Mitochondrial sequence data recovered seven haplotypes (h = 0. 216, π = 0. 001) for South Africa, with one major haplotype shared by 87 % of the individuals {{and at least one}} private haplotype for each sampling location except Port Elizabeth. As with many other coastal shark species with cosmopolitan distribution, this study confirms the lack of both historical dispersal and inter-oceanic gene flow while also implicating contemporary factors such as oceanic currents and thermal fronts to drive local genetic structure of G. galeus on a smaller spatial scale...|$|E
