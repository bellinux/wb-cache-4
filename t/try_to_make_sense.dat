5|$|At {{the police}} station, Pang {{confirms}} that Alan {{is actually an}} undercover cop. Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang. Tequila and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, which allows Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes {{that one of his}} gangsters named Foxy (Tung Wei), is an informant for the police. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog (Philip Kwok) in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although he secretly placed a cigarette lighter in Foxy's breast pocket earlier to prevent the shot from being fatal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is in the nearby Maple Group Hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong finds out that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill Foxy, as well as sending Mad Dog separately to cover Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of Wong's arsenal. While Alan and Tequila are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of leet is its unique approach to orthography, using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word. For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use homoglyphs, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the argot (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the average reader cannot make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords. Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore) require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior {{for both men and}} women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E

Kermode's book is a well received piece of literary criticism. Critic Colin Burrow called it one of “the three most inspiring works of literary criticism written in the twentieth century”, comparing Kermode's work with Erich Auerbach's [...] and E.R. Curtius's European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. The critic Boyd Tonkin adds the additional interpretation that Barnes's “show-off” characters could be typical readers of Kermode's work.|$|E

2500|$|One {{question}} that is addressed by philosophers is which is more fundamental: parts, wholes, or neither? Another pressing question is called the Special Composition Question (SCQ): [...] For any Xs, when is it the case {{that there is a}} Y such that the Xs compose Y? This question has caused philosophers to run in three different directions: [...] nihilism, universal composition (UC), or a moderate view (restricted composition). The first two views are considered extreme since the first denies composition, and the second allows any and all non-spatially overlapping objects to compose another object. The moderate view encompasses several theories that <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of SCQ without saying 'no' to composition or 'yes' to unrestricted composition.|$|E
2500|$|Although other anthropologists at the time, such as Bronisław Malinowski and Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown {{focused on}} the study of societies, which they {{understood}} to be clearly bounded, Boas's attention to history, which reveals the extent to which traits diffuse from one place to another, led him to view cultural boundaries as multiple and overlapping, and as highly permeable. Thus, Boas's student Robert Lowie once described culture as a thing of [...] "shreds and patches". Boas and his students understood that as people <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of their world they seek to integrate its disparate elements, with the result that different cultures could be characterized as having different configurations or patterns. But Boasians also understood that such integration was always in tensions with diffusion, and any appearance of a stable configuration is contingent (see Bashkow 2004: 445).|$|E
2500|$|Ethan Brown from New York {{magazine}} {{stated that}} the song [...] "elicits memories of past pop odes to dance culture", adding that the song's production is a [...] "giddy mix of electro-bounce, campy vocoder chants, and funky keyboard squeals."

[...] Billboard acclaimed the song, stating [...] "the first listen's gonna blast you like a brick wall, as ears and minds <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of the bombast of sonic missiles blasting from your speakers-but successive plays will make clear just how inventive this upstanding composition is." [...] It adds that [...] "it's guaranteed you've never heard Madonna-nor any other popular artist-pull it together this way." [...] While placing the song as the 66th best song of the 2000s decade, Slant Magazine commented that [...] "despite all the new pop starlets out there trying to jump her train, Madonna definitely [...] not slackening pace. When she dropped [...] "Music". she was older than Britney and Christina combined, yet she took them to school with vintage electro-boom, Eurodisco flourishes from French producer Mirwais, and her own inimitable sass." [...] Apart from winning various other awards, [...] "Music" [...] earned two Grammy Award nominations in 2001, for Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E
