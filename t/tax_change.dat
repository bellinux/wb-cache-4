50|$|According to the OECD UK {{taxation}} {{has increased}} from a 39.3% share of GDP in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going {{to a higher level}} than Germany. This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. To have brought this about with only one explicit tax rise has led to accusations of Brown imposing stealth taxes. A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on equity investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly contributing to the demise of some pension funds. The Treasury contend that this <b>tax</b> <b>change</b> was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.|$|E
50|$|In late 2005 {{the status}} of income trusts was uncertain. After {{the close of the}} markets on 23 November 2005, Finance Minister Ralph Goodale made a {{surprise}} announcement that the government would not tax the trusts, and would instead cut dividend taxes. This made trusts and dividend paying stocks even from a taxation perspective. The markets rallied in the hours leading up to the announcement by the government allegedly due to leaks. During the following days, the S&P/TSX Composite Index reached a new five-year high. The day's biggest gainers were income trusts, income-trust candidates, high dividend-paying companies, and the TSX Group itself. The minority Liberal government of Paul Martin fell to a motion of no confidence on 28 November 2005. An election campaign for a 23 January 2006 election began the next day.

In this paper we examine the determinants of a company’s dividend policy and within this framework look at how these <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> have influenced dividend payments.

Real dividends per share increased by about 38 per cent between 1985 / 86 and 1990 / 91. We estimate that the <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> account for a rise in real dividends per share of about 20 per cent during that period. ...|$|R

40|$|Both {{economic}} theory and casual empirical {{observation of the}} U.

This paper offers new empirical estimates of this difference and finds it to he quite substantial. The analysis is based on an amendment of the standard distributed lag version of the permanent in-conic hypothesis that distinguishes temporary taxes from other income {{on the grounds that the}} former are "more transitory. " This amendment, which is broadly consistent with rational expectations, leads to a nonlinear consumption function. Though the standard error is unavoidably large, the point estimate suggests that a temporary <b>tax</b> <b>change</b> is treated as a 50 - 50 blend of a normal income <b>tax</b> <b>change</b> and a pure windfall. Over a 1 -year planning horizon, a temporary <b>tax</b> <b>change</b> is estimated to have only a little more than half the impact of a permanent <b>tax</b> <b>change</b> of equal magnitude, and a rebate is estimated to have only about 38 percent of the impact. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{a regional}} approach {{to assess the}} aggregate effects of cutting taxes on corporations and on taxpayers in different income groups. Determining the optimal course for economic policy critically depends on the efficiency and equity consequences of these policies. The first chapter of this dissertation estimates the incidence of state corporate taxes on workers, landowners, and firm owners in a spatial equilibrium model in which corporate taxes affect the location choices of both firms and workers. Heterogeneous, location-specific productivities and preferences determine the mobility of firms and workers, respectively. Owners of monopolistically competitive firms receive economic profits and may bear the incidence of corporate taxes as heterogeneous productivity can make them inframarginal in their location choices. We derive a simple expression for equilibrium incidence {{as a function of}} a few estimable parameters. Using variation in state corporate tax rates and apportionment rules, we estimate the reduced-form effects of <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> on firm and worker location decisions, wages, and rental costs. We then use minimum distance methods to recover the parameters that determine equilibrium incidence as a function of these reduced-form effects. In contrast to previous assumptions of infinitely mobile firms and perfectly immobile workers, we find that firms are only approximately twice as mobile as workers over a ten-year period. This fact, along with equilibrium impacts on the housing market, implies that firm owners bear roughly 40 % of the incidence, while workers and land owners bear 35 % and 25 %, respectively. Finally, we derive revenue-maximizing state corporate tax rates and discuss interactions with other local taxes and apportionment formulae. The second chapter investigates how <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> for different income groups affect macroeconomic activity. Using historical tax returns from NBER's TAXSIM, I construct a measure of who received (or paid for) Romer and Romer exogenous <b>tax</b> <b>changes.</b> I aggregate these <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> by income group and state. Variation in the income distribution across U. S. states and federal <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> generate variation in regional tax shocks that I exploit to test for heterogeneous effects. I find that the negative relationship between <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> and growth is largely driven by <b>tax</b> <b>changes</b> for lower-income groups and that the effect of tax cuts for the top 10 % on employment growth is small...|$|R
