25|$|The first steam tram {{to service}} Darling Street was in 1892. Ten {{years later the}} service was electrified. A feature of this line was a {{counterweight}} dummy system that controlled and assisted trams on a steep single-line section of track near the terminus at Darling Street wharf. Due to the very steep incline {{at the bottom of}} the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' / counterweight system constructed under the road surface. A 4-wheel 'dummy' car sat on the single-track at the top of the hill, connected via a large sheave under the track to the counterweight running on a narrow-gauge track in a tunnel under the road. A tram destined for the wharf would close-up to the dummy and push it down the steep hill (gradient 1 in 8), thus raising the counterweight and being assisted in braking. The tram was then assisted up the hill by the weight of the descending counterweight via the dummy. The dummy is behind car 2010 in the photograph below, and is on display at the Sydney Tramway Museum. The slot through which the dummy was fixed to the cable can be seen in <b>that</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of papers, Kendall L. Walton argued <b>that</b> <b>photographs</b> are like mirrors, glasses, telescopes and microscopes, in that they {{function}} as ”aids to vision” and that, in this respect, they are sharply contrasted with hand-made pictures, such as drawings and paintings. Walton expressed this point by saying <b>that</b> <b>photographs</b> are ”transparent pictures” while hand-made pictures are not. This I call ”transparency thesis”. This is an elaborated form of a widely held opinion <b>that</b> <b>photographs</b> are intrinsically realistic because of their mechanical origin. In this paper, I examine objections raised against Walton 2 ̆ 7 s thesis and argue that the thesis is still a promising hypothesis {{about the nature of}} photographs as well as the concept of perception in general. ...|$|R

He became inspired by a 1930 photograph by Hungarian photojournalist Martin Munkacsi showing three naked young African boys, caught in near-silhouette, running into the surf of Lake Tanganyika. Titled Three Boys at Lake Tanganyika, this captured the freedom, grace and spontaneity of their movement and their joy at being alive. <b>That</b> <b>photograph</b> inspired him to stop painting and to take up photography seriously.

2500|$|The ACLU, {{representing}} {{plaintiffs in}} a voting rights case, asked the presiding federal judge to prevent Kobach from withholding the public documents he was photographed carrying as {{he met with}} Trump, by virtue of marking them [...] "confidential". The plaintiffs demanded the public release of those documents they have received, that had been prepared with state funds. They claimed Kobach [...] "made statements to the public, the Court, and the President, suggesting that noncitizen registration fraud is a serious, widespread problem", {{at the same time}} he tried to hide those same documents that debunked his claim, to prevent having to testify himself in open court about those same materials. In June 2017, the federal magistrate judge, James O'Hara, found that Kobach had made [...] "patently misleading representations" [...] to the court when he claimed he didn't possess the materials sought by the plaintiffs, in the course of the document dispute. Kobach had been photographed with the president with the documents under his arm, and much of the cover page was readable in <b>that</b> <b>photograph.</b> In light of Kobach's [...] "deceptive conduct and lack of candor", he was fined $1,000 by the court and ordered to submit to questioning by the ACLU about the documents.|$|E

40|$|Critical {{approaches}} to photography {{have one thing}} in common: they share an understanding <b>that</b> <b>photographs</b> must be approached visually. They take it as a given <b>that</b> <b>photographs</b> are pictures to be looked at, and they all agree that it is only through looking <b>that</b> <b>photographs</b> communicate. Whatever subsequent interpretations follow, the priority of vision in relation to the image remains unperturbed. This belief in the visibility of the photograph imperceptibly bonded together otherwise dissimilar and sometimes contradictory methodologies, preventing them from noticing that which is the most unexplained about photography: the precedence of looking itself. This self-evident truth of visibility blocks the possibility of inquiring after everything that is non-visual in a picture. However, the digital image forces a reevaluation of visibility because it clear that the visible cannot account for images that begin their life as binary data, developed algorithmically and driven to various points across the network not as individual pictures but as packets of data. Through a reading of Heidegger, Deleuze and Benjamin this paper suggests that digital-born photography cannot be explained away in representational terms; rather it calls for a theory that can account for proliferation and self-replication as the purveyors of meaning online...|$|R
