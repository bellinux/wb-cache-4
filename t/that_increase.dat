5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are molecules <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the catalytic rate of enzymes.

5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion.

The ketogenic diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the energy reserves; ketone bodies are {{a more efficient}} fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E

However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> {{the rate of}} gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E

Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects the infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E
5|$|In Flow, {{the player}} guides a small, multi-segmented worm- or snake-like {{creature}} through an aquatic environment. There are no menus or guidelines; the game begins immediately. The game world, which is viewed from a top-down perspective, consists of two-dimensional planes stacked vertically upon each other. A blurred {{version of the}} layer below appears {{in the background of}} each plane. Planes contain organisms of varying sizes; the player's creature automatically attempts to consume them when they are nearby. The majority of these creatures are non-confrontational, and are composed of cells <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the number of segments in the player's creature when eaten. All planes, except for the highest and lowest, contain two specially colored organisms that move the player's creature up or down one plane when touched.|$|E

It was nominated for several Independent Games Festival awards, and The Atlantic critic Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a design object, a feat unique for the video game medium.|$|E

5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins <b>that</b> <b>increase</b> the exchange rate by orders of magnitude, and site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E
