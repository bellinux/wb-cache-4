5000|$|The Tantric Buddhist Yogāvacara {{tradition}} was a mainstream Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand {{well into the}} modern era. An inscription from Northern Thailand with <b>tantric</b> <b>elements</b> has been dated to the Sukhothai Kingdom of the 16th century. Kate Crosby notes that this attestation makes the tantric tradition earlier than “any other living meditation tradition in the contemporary Theravada world.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in the 19th century, Indian modernists re-asserted Hinduism {{as a major}} asset of Indian civilisation, {{meanwhile}} [...] "purifying" [...] Hinduism {{from its}} <b>Tantric</b> <b>elements</b> and elevating the Vedic elements. Western stereotypes were reversed, emphasizing the universal aspects, and introducing modern approaches of social problems. This approach had a great appeal, not only in India, {{but also in the}} west. Major representatives of [...] "Hindu modernism" [...] are Raja Rammohan Roy, Vivekananda, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Mahatma Gandhi.|$|R
2500|$|Since the 19th century Indian modernists have re-asserted the 'Aryan origins' of Hinduism, [...] "purifying" [...] Hinduism {{from its}} <b>Tantric</b> <b>elements</b> and {{elevating}} the Vedic elements. Hindu modernists like Vivekananda see the Vedas as {{the laws of}} the spiritual world, which would still exist even if they were not revealed to the sages. In Tantric tradition, the Agamas refer to authoritative scriptures or the teachings of Shiva to Shakti, while Nigamas refers to the Vedas and the teachings of Shakti to Shiva. In Agamic schools of Hinduism, the Vedic literature and the Agamas are equally authoritative.|$|R
40|$|Various Śaiva <b>Tantric</b> <b>elements</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} in the Yogavāsiṣṭha, but little {{has been written about the}} role of kuṇḍalinī rising in relation to this text’s notion of living liberation (jīvanmukti). The story of Cūḍālā and Śikhidhvaja is relevant to examine in Tantric studies not only because it includes one of the few descriptions within Sanskrit literature of a kuṇḍalinī experience as explicitly pertaining to a woman, but also because it offers key elements of comparison between experiences of enlightenment: one including kuṇḍalinī rising (Cūḍālā) and another one without it (Śikhidhvaja). This paper compares Cūḍālā’s experience of enlightenment with that of Śikhidhvaja’s in order to understand what role kuṇḍalinī rising plays in the pursuit for liberation...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Brown {{similarly}} {{notes that}} the term [...] "tantrism" [...] is a construct of Western scholarship, not a concept of the religious system itself. He defines Tantrism as an apologetic label of Westerners for a system that they little understand that is [...] "not coherent" [...] and which is [...] "an accumulated set of practices and ideas from various sources, that has varied between its practitioners within a group, varied across groups, across geography and over its history". It is a system, adds Brown, that gives each follower the freedom to mix <b>Tantric</b> <b>elements</b> with non-Tantric aspects, to challenge and transgress any and all norms, experiment with [...] "the mundane to reach the supramundane".|$|R
50|$|Damaru of {{all kinds}} are {{traditionally}} paired with a long sash or tail called a chöpen. The chöpen {{is attached to the}} end of the drum's handle so that it waves about while the drum is being played. They are most commonly made of brocade or silk using the colors of the <b>tantric</b> <b>elements.</b> On smaller damaru, the chöpen is usually found without adornment, but on chöd damaru, the tail will often feature several items which have been sewn onto the fabric. These adornments commonly include but are not limited to: a polished silver mirror or melong, a set of small bells, strips of tiger and/or leopard skin, one or more precious stones (i.e. dzi bead), and any number of small brass trinkets.|$|R
40|$|Already the {{earliest}} written {{evidence from the}} Nepalamandala, i. e. the inscriptions of the Lichavi kings, show the co-existence of the various sects and forms of both Buddhism and Hinduism. Both forms of Aryan belief were followed by the populace and honoured by the kings. Vedic traditions, too, occasionally are mentioned along with Hindu and Buddhist religious practices. The Vedic religion, which preceded both Buddhism and medieval Hinduism, had already in Lichavi time largely been superseded by Pauranic and <b>Tantric</b> <b>elements,</b> yet this oldest form of Aryan worship and learning has {{come down to the}} present age and was prominently displayed in some of the rites performed at the coronation ceremony of H.

40|$|The Compendium of Principles of All Tath›gatas (Sarva-tath›gata-tattva-sa˙graha) {{is arguably}} the single most {{important}} development of Indian Buddhist tantra. In this text we find the coalescence of a variety of <b>tantric</b> <b>elements</b> organized around two new and seminal narratives—⁄›kyamuni’s enlightenment recast in tantric terms and Vajrap›˚i’s subjugation of MaheŸvara—that for the first time self-consciously announce tantra as a new and distinct form of Buddhism. In declaring tantra’s independence, these narratives present a clearly defined soteriological goal, a new paradigm for this liberative path in which ritual is central, and innovations such as deity yoga (self-generation as an enlightened figure), consecration rites, and practices involving violence and sex. These reflect both developments within Buddhism and external pressures, including violence and the exercise of power predominant in early medieval Indian socio-political forms as well as a decline in patronage of Buddhist institutions. The Compendium of Principles marks the emergence of mature Indian Buddhist tantra {{at the end of the}} seventh century, and it immediately spawned a body of literary progeny that has played a central and enduring role in the development of tantric Buddhism i...|$|R
500|$|Outside of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain {{traditions in}} Asia, the term [...] "yoga" [...] has been usually synonymous with its asanas (postures) or {{as a form}} of exercise. This aspect of Yoga was adopted as a {{cultural}} trend in Europe and North America starting {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. There were periods of criticism and paranoia against yoga as well. By the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of Neo-Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public. During this period, most of the influential Indian teachers of yoga came from two lineages, those of Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963) and of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888–1989). Teachers of Hatha yoga who were active in the west in this period included B.K.S. Iyengar (1918–2014), K. Pattabhi Jois (1915–2009), Swami Vishnu-devananda (1927–1993), and Swami Satchidananda (1914–2002). Yogi Bhajan brought Kundalini Yoga to the United States in 1969.

5000|$|Historically, the Buddhists of Abhayagiri vihāra in Sri Lanka {{are known}} to have practiced Tantric Vajrayana and Mahayana and this might have had an {{influence}} on Southeast Asia through their missionary work in Java. Ari Buddhism was a form of Buddhism practiced in the Mon kingdoms of Burma which also contained <b>Tantric</b> <b>elements</b> borrowed from India and local Nat (spirit) and Nāga worship. In many of Bizot's works there is some suggestion that the Buddhism of the Mon may have influenced the later Yogāvacara tradition. It is also possible that Southeast Asian Buddhism was influenced by the practice of Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism which flourished in Southeast Asia {{during the time of the}} Khmer Empire. According to Lance Cousins, it is also possible that 'Tantric Theravada' developed within the [...] "orthodox" [...] Mahavihara tradition of Sri Lanka, citing the 5th century Buddhist scholar Buddhagosa's mention of secret texts (gulhagantham) as well as other textual evidence from the Pali commentaries. Cousins concludes that [...] "It is quite possible that present-day esoteric Buddhism containsideas and practices deriving from more than one of these sources. Nevertheless it is certainly premature to assume that it has its origins in unorthodox circles." ...|$|R

Moreover, it should be stated that the falling of Buddhadharma relics upon a Tibetan royal palace also happened in the case of Thothori Nyantsen and these two stories (i.e. the story of Thothori Nyantsen and the narrative of King Ja) may have influenced each other as they share a distinctive motif of magical realism.|$|R
