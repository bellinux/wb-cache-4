5|$|Ksarakardama (acidic/saline mud/filth): One who in false pride, {{does not}} honour a person higher <b>than</b> <b>him</b> by birth, austerity, knowledge, behaviour, caste or spiritual order, is {{tortured}} in this hell. Yamadutas throw him head-first and torment him.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect <b>than</b> <b>Him.</b> And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other <b>than</b> <b>Him,</b> and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other <b>than</b> <b>Him</b> there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

5|$|In all, Leonardo had twelve half-siblings, {{who were}} much younger <b>than</b> <b>him</b> (the last was born when Leonardo was forty years old) {{and with whom}} he had very few contacts, but they caused him {{difficulty}} after his father's death in the dispute over the inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier <b>than</b> <b>him</b> which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E
5|$|Laurie (Busy Philipps) bets Travis (Dan Byrd) {{twenty dollars}} {{that she can}} stay awake longer <b>than</b> <b>him.</b> Laurie cheats, taking naps at every {{possible}} opportunity, accepting that she will lose the bet, but enjoying the opportunity to mess with Travis. When the bet is over, they acknowledge how much they will miss each other when Travis leaves for college.|$|E

When Cronos devoured their children {{in an attempt to}} cheat the prophecy that one of his children would become greater <b>than</b> <b>him,</b> Rhea tricked Cronos and ensured the young Zeus was hidden away and protected by Gaia. Rhea's fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Weber has a brother, Brandon, who is {{two years}} younger <b>than</b> <b>him</b> {{and grew up}} playing hockey with Shea's former Predators {{teammate}} Cody Franson. When Weber was 14, his mother was diagnosed with brain cancer, which surgery mostly removed. She later began suffering from similar symptoms, however, and in early 2010 {{had a series of}} seizures. Weber's mother was placed in an induced coma, and died on August 11, 2010.|$|E
5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful <b>than</b> <b>him.</b> She then tells him that {{she had nothing to}} do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings were real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E

5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is upset}} that his {{daughter}} Jada would rather spend Christmas with her mother <b>than</b> <b>him.</b> At the party, Jada begins to lose interest, but Pam and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) try to find fun activities for her; however, Andy ends up ruining most of them. Darryl then takes her to the break room, where she is impressed with the snacks in the vending machines. They take out the snacks and hand them to employees. When she hands one to Michael, he decides to dress up as Santa again so she can tell him what she wants for Christmas as Holly looks on with admiration.|$|E
5|$|Guest {{joined up}} again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901. He {{was given the}} rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success. He was {{recommended}} for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, whose Colonel decided that Guest {{was too young to}} lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older <b>than</b> <b>him.</b> Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served {{until the end of the}} war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer farm buildings and crops, and detaining women and children in concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|His {{youngest}} sister Princess Amelia {{was conceived}} {{in the months}} after Alfred's death, born almost exactly a year after he died. The first of George III and Queen Charlotte's children to die, Alfred died nearly seventy five years before his older sister Mary, who was the last survivor of George III and Queen Charlotte's fifteen children. Alfred is also unique among their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger <b>than</b> <b>him</b> was born after his death.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, Rey Bucanero {{announced}} that he had left Los Guerreros and joined La Peste Negra because Los Guerreros were more interested in teaming with Olímpico <b>than</b> <b>him.</b> On December 3 at Sin Piedad 2010 Bucanero defeated Los Invasores leader Mr. Águila in a Lucha de Apuesta match, forcing Mr. Águila to have his orange mohawk shaved off. On January 29, 2011, Bucanero made an appearance for American promotion Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), during the WrestleReunion 5 weekend, in a match, where he was defeated by Mr. Águila.|$|E
5|$|In {{regard to}} the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one {{can see from the}} {{proposals}} of Plato in The Laws: presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer <b>than</b> <b>him,</b> etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 660s, two {{important}} marriages took place. Ecgfrith of Northumbria, the fifteen-year-old son of Oswiu, married Æthelthryth of Ely, {{the daughter of}} Anna of East Anglia, (who was about fourteen years older <b>than</b> <b>him),</b> and moved {{to live with him}} at his Northumbrian court. She had remained a virgin for Christ during her first marriage: she continued in this resolve as Ecgfrityh's bride, with the result that he could not expect to father an heir. Æthelthryth retained Ely as her own possession during this marriage.|$|E
5|$|In the {{transfer}} market, {{the most significant}} signings were of 28-year-old Quim, Portugal's second-choice goalkeeper, to compete with incumbent starter José Moreira. Defender Takis Fyssas also saw {{the arrival of a}} competitor, former Marseille player Manuel dos Santos. Benfica also signed Norwegian striker Azar Karadas after his compelling performance against them in the previous season's UEFA Cup with Rosenborg. The most significant departure was Tiago, who moved to Chelsea for a fee that Record announced was around €12 million. Other <b>than</b> <b>him,</b> only Armando Sá and Hélder Cristóvão were regularly used, and both continued their careers abroad, with Villarreal and Paris Saint-Germain respectively.|$|E
5|$|Richard White as Gaston – A vain {{hunter who}} vies for Belle's hand in {{marriage}} and is {{determined not to}} let anyone else win her heart. He serves as a foil personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistic as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more <b>than</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|In Baldwin's {{hall that}} day Hereward met Dolfin; {{and when the}} {{magnificent}} young Scot sprang to him, embraced him, talked over old passages, complimented him on his fame, lamented that he himself had won no such honors in the field, Hereward felt much more inclined to fight for <b>him</b> <b>than</b> against <b>him.</b>|$|R
