25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with medications recommended only in {{those who are not}} interested in therapy. CBT is effective in treating social phobia, whether delivered individually or in a group setting. <b>The</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> behavioral components seek to change thought patterns and physical reactions to anxiety-inducing situations. The attention given to social anxiety disorder has significantly increased since 1999 with the approval and marketing of drugs for its treatment. Prescribed medications include several classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other commonly used medications include beta blockers and benzodiazepines. It is the most common anxiety disorder with up to 10% of people being affected {{at some point in their}} life.|$|E
500|$|Future {{directions}} for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> linguistic demands of AAC, and {{the barriers to}} effective social interaction. AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use. The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies {{has the potential to}} radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices; [...] however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. Android and other open source operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required. Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development. Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions. Natural language generation techniques have been investigated, including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners, data from a user's schedule and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches, as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors. However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: [...] "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".|$|E

2500|$|Because most {{injuries}} {{sustained by}} adolescents {{are related to}} risky behavior (car crashes, alcohol, unprotected sex), {{a great deal of}} research has been done on <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> emotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking. [...] In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are {{more likely to engage in}} risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions. [...] The behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} become an {{educational}} psychologist, students can complete an undergraduate degree in their choice.

Some work in university settings where they carry out research on <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> social processes of human development, learning and education. Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.Educational psychologists who work in k–12 school settings (closely related are school psychologists in the US and Canada) are trained at the master's and doctoral levels. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention. However, school psychologists are generally more individual-oriented towards students.|$|E

The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten more with less colorful titles. “n {{the last day of}} the workshop the participants agreed [...] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of <b>the</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.” Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al.
