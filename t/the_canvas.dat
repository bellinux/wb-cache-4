5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on to <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> and {{rendering}} him unconscious. Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest.

He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E
5|$|Both {{panel and}} frame {{are in good}} condition.

5|$|The painted {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time.

5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented, <b>the</b> <b>canvas</b> cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the searchlights.

5|$|Interpretations vary. <b>The</b> <b>canvas</b> {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>canvas.</b> In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E
