40|$|Nano-sized {{particles}} (NSPs) have {{a diameter}} of less than 100 nm. When inhaled, they preferentially deposit in the deeper lung, where pulmonary surfactant covers the thin aqueous lining layer. Thus, pulmonary surfactant is the initial contact where NSPs impinge. This can lead to various consequences. For example, binding of NSPs to single surfactant components like phospholipids or surfactant proteins can occur, which might modulate <b>toxic</b> <b>particle</b> effects. Moreover, particle clearance can be modulated. Furthermore, the biophysical surfactant function itself can be disturbed by interaction with NSPs. In addition, surfactant displaces particles into the aqueous hypophase of the lining layer, where they can {{come into contact with}} type II pneumocytes. This interaction has been suggested to affect pulmonary surfactant metabolism.

It {{has been established}} for many years that pigment-grade TiO 2 (200 nm sphere) is relatively inert when internalized into a biological model system (in vivo or in vitro). For this reason, TiO 2 nanomaterials are considered an attractive alternative in applications where biological exposures will occur. Unfortunately, metal oxides on the nanoscale (one dimension Results TiO 2 nanospheres, short (15 μm) nanobelts were synthesized, characterized and tested for biological activity using primary murine alveolar macrophages and in vivo in mice. This study demonstrates that alteration of anatase TiO 2 nanomaterial into a fibre structure of greater than 15 μm creates a highly <b>toxic</b> <b>particle</b> and initiates an inflammatory response by alveolar macrophages. These fibre-shaped nanomaterials induced inflammasome activation and release of inflammatory cytokines through a cathepsin B-mediated mechanism. Consequently, long TiO 2 nanobelts interact with lung macrophages in a manner very similar to asbestos or silica. Conclusions These observations suggest that any modification of a nanomaterial, resulting in a wire, fibre, belt or tube, be tested for pathogenic potential.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} some {{fascinating}} behaviour {{emerging from a}} simple synthetic chemistry model. The results of Ono and Ikegami (2001) demonstrated the spontaneous formation of primitive, self-reproducing cells from a random homogeneous mixture of chemical components. Their model made use of a simple, artificial reaction network. Discrete particles were placed on a triangular lattice and the dynamics consisted of the following particle transitions: translation over one lattice spacing and chemical transformation. The primary particle types were membrane-forming particles, catalysts and water. The membrane particles formed structures akin to lipid bilayers. Their synthesis was stimulated by the catalyst particles, which were also capable of template self-replication using precursors. The system readily exhibits protocell formation from a random initial condition. These protocells form, grow, divide and eventually decay in a continuous cycle. Such emergent dynamics were an illuminating result given that the simulation itself only defines local interactions between particles {{and a set of}} physical transition rules. The protocell structures are not explicitly represented or built into the model. Hence it demonstrated a basic physical logic wherein the concepts of self-maintenance and self-reproduction could arise spontaneously from a set of simpler, lower level rules. In essence, it was an in silico realisation of the principle of autopoiesis. We decided to extend this work by augmenting the particle species repertoire. An additional catalyst was added, which did not stimulate the synthesis of membrane particles, but rather stimulated their decay. It was expected that this would reduce the rate of protocell formation. However a surprising dynamic was uncovered with this new system. As one might expect the protocells did not arise in abundance as in the original model. Instead they formed in small, isolated colonies since this was the only means by which they could avoid the destructive effects of the new catalyst. However because this <b>toxic</b> <b>particle</b> was also autocatalytic (like the other, constructive catalyst), its concentration rose sharply in regions confined by membrane particles since the membranes slowed their outward diffusion. Thus membranes actually created a niche for the toxic catalyst. This in turn produced a predator-prey dynamic with clouds of the <b>toxic</b> <b>particle</b> growing near protocells and protocells being forced to grow in the opposite direction to avoid the destructive effects of the new particle. These results reveal that high level, ecological phenomena can manifest themselves even in simple physico-chemical systems. They demonstrate that ideas of natural selection and fitness are intimately bound with the basic principle of free energy minimisation. We have also now enhanced the model further by adding a second reaction network. It is similar, but independent to the first and allows for two "species" of protocell. It is also possible for hybrids to form, comprised of mixtures of the membrane particles from the two reaction networks. Results from this new version are currently being gathered and analyse...|$|E

In this paper, we research the process of natural non-stationary mass transport in atmosphere. We deal with the system consisted of fluid (air – continuum) in which a toxic pollutant is added. The distribution of pollutants in atmosphere is described by the concentration field c(r, t). Diffusion, as the mixing process caused by random walk of molecules (or particles) which, from macroscopic point of view, hardly occupy the configuration with maximum entropy (in absence of outer forces- homogeneous mixture), can be appeared on molecular level or with velocity gradients caused by shear forces (like wind shear). The second case show greater degree of mixing, known as dispersion.

In silica-exposed mice, a significant increase in ICAM- 1 was detected on day 1 and localized by immunohistochemistry to aggregates of pulmonary macrophages and to type 11 epithelial cells. Areas of the lung with increased ICAM- 1 expression also showed increased tumor necrosis factor alpha expression. Immunocytochemical staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells demonstrated increased ICAM- 1 expression associated with alveolar macrophages 3, 5, and 7 days following silica exposure.

These works demonstrate a significant neutrophil influx into the bronchoalveolar space within one day of exposure followed by an influx of macrophages. It is unclear if this leukocyte migration is dependent upon the increased expression of adhesion proteins. ^ This 2 ̆ 2 adhesion cascade 2 ̆ 2 is a complex process involving the upregulation and downregulation of several membrane bound proteins on the leukocyte cell surface and on the cells with which they interact.

Expression of ICAM- 1 on alveolar macrophages was later confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis of cells isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage. Analysis of the lavage fluid from silica exposed mice also showed significant increases in soluble ICAM- 1 levels.

Nanoparticle {{formation}} and emission mechanisms were assessed at pilot plant scale during irradiation of commercial ceramic tiles using a state-of-the-art continuous laser furnace. Laser irradiation of ceramic tiles {{is a novel}} technique for tile sintering developed {{in the framework of}} LIFE project LASERFIRING (www. laserfiring. eu), with numerous advantages regarding the sintering process (speed, temperature), durability and coating layer of the tiles. As a result, the implementation of higher powered CO 2 lasers for commercial industrial processes is currently being assessed under LIFE project CERAMGLASS (www. ceramglass. eu). However, nanoparticle emissions during laser irradiation of tiles have so far never been evaluated. The aim of this work was to characterise nanoparticle {{formation and}} emission mechanisms, as well as their impact on exposure, during this industrial process. To this end, nanoparticle number, size distribution, mass concentration, surface area and size-resolved chemical composition were monitored using two sets of instruments (TSI water-CPC, TSI NanoScan, Grimm particle counter 1108, DiscMini, and PCIS impactors) located simultaneously at the emission source and the worker breathing zone. The sintering of six different types of commercial tiles was assessed, undergoing maximum temperatures of 1200 °C. The tiles consisted of porcelain and red clays, and in each case the tiles were raw, frit coated and frit and decoration coated. Results evidenced that nanoparticle formation takes place during tile sintering through SO 2 -induced nucleation processes, and that primary nanoparticles are also emitted during laser irradiation of the tiles. As a result, nanoparticle concentrations reached a maximum of 9. 7 * 105 #/cm 3 (mean size = 18 nm) at the emission source over the 2 -hour periods during which each of the tiles underwent the thermal treatment. For all tiles, concentrations at the emission source were in the range of 105 #/cm 3, with mean sizes ranging between 8 and 18 nm. When emissions were transported toward the area where the workers were exposed, and at breathing zone level, particle number concentrations decreased by approximately one order of magnitude (maximum mean N concentration = 1. 1 * 105 #/cm 3) and particle diameter increased from 18 to 26 nm, thus remaining at extremely high concentrations with very low and potentially <b>toxic</b> <b>particle</b> sizes. In terms of mass, an increase was detected from the emission source towards the breathing zone, as expected due to particle ageing. The chemical characterisation of the nanoparticles collected on filter samples displayed high contents of toxic metals (mainly Zn, Pb, Cr and As), especially in the PM 0. 25 particle size fraction (the lowest fraction collected by the impactors).

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) currently attract intense {{research efforts}} {{because of their}} unique properties which make them suitable for many industrial applications. When inhaled, CNTs constitute a possible hazard to human health. Several {{studies have shown that}} when instilled in the lung of experimental animals, CNTs induced an inflammatory and fibrotic response similar to that caused by other <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> which might be the result of oxidative stress caused by particle- and/or cell-derived free radicals. There is, however, no direct experimental evidence of a capacity of carbon nanotubes to generate directly free radicals. Here we report that multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in aqueous suspension do not generate oxygen or carbon-centered free radicals in the presence of H 2 O 2 or formate, respectively, as detected with the spin-trapping technique. Conversely, we observed that, when in contact with an external source of hydroxyl or superoxide radicals, MWCNT exhibit a remarkable radical scavenging capacity. It is therefore possible that the inflammatory reaction reported in vivo must be ascribed to MWCNT features other than particle-derived free radical generation...|$|R
40|$|Little {{information}} on the evaluation of airborne particulate matter (APM) and sedimentation particles from subway stations is available. The thermal metamorphism of train wheels generating <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> in subway stations is a possibility. In this study, the toxicity and physiological effects of particles from subway stations were evaluated using a yeast bioassay system. Estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of APM in APM extracts from subway stations were determined. No estrogenic activity {{was found in the}} APM fractions and their S 9 -activated APM samples. Sedimentation dust samples also showed no estrogen activity. In contrast, extracts from sedimentation dust samples showed antiestrogen activity. Marked yeast toxicity was observed in the samples extracted from sedimentation dust. Potent yeast toxicity was also found in the S 9 -activated extracts from sedimentation dust. The results suggest that sedimentation dust from a semiclosed area of a subway system has antiestrogen activity, although both the origin and generation system of this activity are uncertain. These pollutants in sedimentation dust may change to a more toxic form in vivo by S 9 activation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{pathogenesis}} {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) {{is based on}} the innate and adaptive inflammatory immune response to the inhalation of <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> and gases. Although tobacco smoking is the primary cause of this inhalation injury, many other environmental and occupational exposures contribute to the pathology of COPD. The immune inflammatory changes associated with COPD are linked to a tissue-repair and -remodeling process that increases mucus production and causes emphysematous destruction of the gas-exchanging surface of the lung. The common form of emphysema observed in smokers begins in the respiratory bronchioles near the thickened and narrowed small bronchioles that become the major site of obstruction in COPD. The inflamed airways of COPD patients contain several inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. The relative contribution of mast cells to airway injury and remodeling is not well documented. In this review, an overview is given on the possible role of mast cells and their mediators in the pathogenesis of COPD. Activation of mast cells and mast cell signaling in response to exposure to cigarette smoke is further discussed...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} spread of carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) applications, the respiratory toxicity of these compounds has {{attracted the attention}} of many scientists. Several studies have reported that after lung administration, CNTs could induce granuloma, fibrosis, or inflammation. By comparison with the mechanisms involved with other <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> such as asbestos, this effect could be attributed to an increase of oxidative stress. The aim of the present work was to test this hypothesis in vivo. Mice were intranasally instilled with 1. 5 mg/kg of double walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). Six, 24, or 48 h after administration, inflammation and localisation of DWCNTs in lungs were microscopically observed. Local oxidative perturbations were investigated using ESR spin trapping experiments, and systemic inflammation was assessed by measuring the plasma concentration of cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IGF- 1, Leptin, G-CSF, and VEGF. Examination of lungs and the elevation of proinflammatory cytokines in the plasma (Leptin and IL- 6 at 6 h) confirmed the induction of an inflammatory reaction. This inflammatory reaction was accompanied by a decrease in the local oxidative stress. This effect could be attributed to the scavenger capability of pure CNTs...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{antibody}} and a glucosaminidase enzyme {{react with}} the serologically active sites on C polysaccharide, and local injection of these reagents will neutralize the toxic effect of C polysaccharide complexes even after an interval of 24 to 72 hours. The cell wall lysins in S. albus filtrate and from phage-lysed Group C streptococci, {{break down the}} cell wall structure of Group A streptococci but leave the serological reactive sites of the C polysaccharide intact. These reagents lose much {{of their ability to}} neutralize the C polysaccharide toxin when superinjected after an interval of 4 hours following toxin injections. Toxic C polysaccharide cannot be recovered from an injection site by intercellular perfusion of the excised skin area after an interval of 1 to 4 hours following toxin injection. It is concluded that <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> of C polysaccharide complexes combine firmly with the dermal tissue of rabbits within 1 to 4 hours following intracutaneous injection. The cell wall lysins neutralize the toxin by reducing the particle size of C polysaccharide complexes. This minimum particle size is required for the initial reaction with tissue and when this has occurred these reagents are no longer able to influence the development of the lesion...|$|R

40|$|During {{the launch}} of the Space Shuttle vehicle, the burning of liquid {{hydrogen}} fuel with liquid oxygen at extreme high temperatures inside the three space shuttle main engines, and the burning of the solid propellant mixture of ammonium perchlorate oxidizer, aluminum fuel, iron oxide catalyst, polymer binder, and epoxy curing agent in the two solid rocket boosters result in the formation of a large cloud of hot, buoyant toxic exhaust gases near the ground level which subsequently rises and entrains into ambient air until the temperature and density of the cloud reaches an approximate equilibrium with ambient conditions. In this paper, toxic gas dispersion for various gases are simulated over the web for varying environmental conditions which is provided by rawinsonde data. The model simulates chemical concentration at ground level up to 10 miles (1 KM grids) in downrange up to an hour after launch. The ambient concentration of the gas dispersion and the deposition of <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> are used as inputs for a human health risk assessment model. The advantage of the present model is the accessibility and dissemination of model results to other NASA centers over the web. The model can be remotely operated and various scenarios can be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Urban atmospheres {{in modern}} cities carry {{characteristic}} mixtures of particulate pollution which are potentially aggravating for chronic respiratory patients (CRP). Although air quality surveys can be detailed, the obtained {{information is not}} always useful to evaluate human health effects. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate particle deposition rates in airways of CRP, based on real air pollution data. By combining computational fluid dynamics with physical-chemical characteristics of particulate pollution, deposition rates are estimated for particles of different toxicological relevance, that is, minerals, iron oxides, sea salts, ammonium salts, and carbonaceous particles. Also, it enables some qualitative evaluation of the spatial, temporal, and patient specific effects on the particle dose upon exposure to the urban atmosphere. Results show how heavy traffic conditions increases the deposition of anthropogenic particles in the trachea and lungs of respiratory patients (here, + 0. 28 and + 1. 5 μg·h– 1, respectively). In addition, local and synoptic meteorological conditions {{were found to have}} a strong effect on the overall dose. However, the pathology and age of the patient was found to be more crucial, with highest deposition rates for <b>toxic</b> <b>particles</b> in adults with a mild anomaly, followed by mild asthmatic children and adults with severe respiratory dysfunctions (7, 5, and 3 μg·h– 1, respectively) ...|$|R
