500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was in no}} {{disposition}} for Uriah's company, but in {{remembrance of}} the entreaty Agnes had made to me, that I {{asked him if he}} would come home <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> have some coffee.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very anxious," [...] he continued, [...] "not to {{distress}} you, but I cannot {{let you go}} {{away like}} this. Will you come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> let us talk for a little time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lizzie, my dear,' said Mrs. Woodbourne presently, 'would {{you just}} run <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> fetch down the green receipt-book?' ...|$|E
60|$|No person came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> nothing {{happened}} to interrupt me while I was reading Mr. Philip Dunboyne's letters.|$|E
60|$|I passed <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> went to bed, and, {{strange to}} say, slept without dreaming. Despair {{has its own}} calms.|$|E
60|$|Farrar {{was very}} poor company that evening, {{and left me}} early. I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> had taken down a volume of Carlyle, who can {{generally}} command my attention, when there came {{a knock at the}} door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty strenuous time," [...] Sir Charles remarked. [...] "Up at nine, {{played golf}} at Ranelagh all morning, lunched down there, back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> changed, called on my tailor, went round to the club, had one game of billiards and four rubbers of bridge." ...|$|R
60|$|Nor did I. For {{two hours}} and a half I tramped the streets, my spirits sinking more and more under the {{influence}} of failure and a blend of snow and sleet which had begun to fall; and then, tired out, I went back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> climbed sorrowfully into bed.|$|R
60|$|ELLIE. I'm too tired. I'll take a book up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> rest a little. [She {{goes to the}} bookshelf].|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> take your things off?" [...] enquired Mrs. Church, {{returning}} the old lady’s hostile stare with interest.|$|E
60|$|After some {{conversation}} on the current war news, we retired, and I immediately proceeded <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> wrote out this paper. J. W. CRISFIELD.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is odd," [...] {{said the}} little man, arching his black eyebrows. [...] "I live, myself, in Himylaya Mansions, round the corner. Perhaps you might care {{to come with}} me; I can go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> sort out these queer Welkin documents, while you run round and get your friend the detective." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll not say, Lane. There's no {{need for}} that. I'll give you a key <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> you can go there--in the afternoons--and paste {{yourself}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> peep-hole, and watch.... Honest to God, I believe it means bloodshed. But I can't help that. Something must be done. I'm not much good, but I can see that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you know}} nothing about her, careless, and would hold her up to public scorn if it gave you a minute's amusement. Therefore you risk your life {{for the sake of}} her brat. No, Loo, I'm not the angel. I shall keep <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> avoid her. But do as you please--only tell me why you do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Much {{exhausted}} {{by one of}} the hardest nights of toil and exposure I ever spent, I retired <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> sought and found repose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'On that night, when, {{emboldened by}} the scene you had {{assisted}} at, you dared come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> speak to me,' she said, 'what passed?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do," [...] {{declared}} Randy. [...] "I'll run back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> get my pocket flashlight. That will be just the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure. That's {{the way to}} be revenged. Hetty," [...] he added, {{turning to}} the artist, who alone of the {{observers}} had smiled instead of groaned at the old gentleman's startling suggestion, [...] "will you kindly run up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> get a red leather case that lies under the shell cabinet? Thank you, my dear." ...|$|R
60|$|I ran <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lady's <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> with no preparatory cruelty {{disclosed}} my news.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you know}} nothing about her, careless, and would hold her up to public scorn if it gave you a minute's amusement. Therefore you risk your life {{for the sake of}} her brat.

6000|$|... "You {{can go up}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> help me stow {{away some}} baggage," [...] he said, glancing around {{as if to make}} certain they were not observed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] said Austin. [...] "I was uncommonly thankful when Bill {{got hold}} of him. Send him along <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> then start your engines." ...|$|E
60|$|I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and,</b> as my custom is, {{read for}} an hour stories in my {{favourite}} magazines. This was to get my mind back to art again.|$|E
60|$|March 3.--Running {{short of}} tobacco, go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> billet's <b>room</b> <b>and</b> try a pipe of his. Take all the {{remedies}} except the castor-oil.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are under}} the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He {{is going to bring}} you up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room." ...|$|R
60|$|I went up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife's <b>room</b> <b>and</b> {{told her}} what the {{children}} had said of Tedham's call, {{and that he was}} coming back again.|$|R
60|$|I left Jacky peeking {{still and}} I went to bed. After {{a long time}} Aunt Tommy came up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> sat down on my bed in the moonlight.|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> rang up number 157. The voice which {{answered}} {{me was the}} voice of the woman who had denied me admission to the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare," [...] said Mr Brandon, rising, [...] "my {{conduct is}} indefensible, but I am going <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and,</b> on my way, will keep {{my part of}} the contract." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{made this}} nurse the {{following}} offer: If she {{would bring the}} dilatory boy <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> leave him there {{for half an hour}} I would look at him. At first Mary, to whom the offer was passed on, rejected it with hauteur, but presently she wavered, and the upshot was that Irene, looking scornful and anxious, arrived one day with the perambulator. Without casting eyes on its occupant, I pointed Irene to the door: [...] "In half-an-hour," [...] I said.|$|R
60|$|We {{walked along}} the Embankment to Adelphi Terrace, where I took him up <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> seated him in my easy-chair near the window. As he sat down, one of the trains on the Metropolitan line whirred past the Terrace, {{snorting}} steam and whistling shrilly, after the fashion of Metropolitan engines generally. My mysterious stranger jumped back in alarm, {{and seemed to be}} afraid of some immediate catastrophe. There was absolutely no possibility of doubting it. The man had obviously never seen a locomotive before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Aunt, I'll {{leave you}} {{for a quarter of}} an hour just <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> then I shall come and give full {{attention}} to everything." ...|$|R
