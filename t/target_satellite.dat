5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although {{the rest of the}} radar used Vacuum tubes. The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik <b>target</b> <b>satellite,</b> DS-P1-Yu, was used to test the ability of the system.|$|E
500|$|The project's only unique role, that {{of being}} able to destroy {{satellite}}s, was then given to fighter planes, which were cheaper and could hit a satellite without being detected, and also to the LIM-49 Nike Zeus, a ballistic missile with possible anti-satellite use. Under Program 437, the Thor DSV-2 rocket, which was derived from the PGM-17 Thor Intermediate-range ballistic missile, was made. The DSV-2 would carry W49 or W50 nuclear warheads, which would ensure that the <b>target</b> <b>satellite</b> would either be destroyed by the nuclear blast, or the resulting electromagnetic pulse. A wing of the program was called [...] "Alternate Payload" [...] used DSV-2J rockets, which were also based on the PGM-17 Thor, to inspect satellites.|$|E
2500|$|V.K. Saraswat {{said that}} an ASAT version is {{technically}} possible: ASAT weapon [...] would [...] require [...] reaching about 800km altitude.

50|$|The Soviet {{space station}} Salyut 3 was {{fitted with a}} 23mm cannon, which was {{successfully}} test fired at <b>target</b> <b>satellites,</b> at ranges from 500 to 3000 m.|$|R
5000|$|The IS {{system was}} [...] "co-orbital", {{approaching}} its target {{over time and}} then exploding a shrapnel warhead close enough to kill it. The missile was launched when a <b>target</b> <b>satellite's</b> ground track rises above the launch site. Once the satellite is detected, the missile is launched into orbit close to the <b>targeted</b> <b>satellite.</b> It takes 90 to 200 minutes (or one to two orbits) for the missile interceptor to {{get close enough to}} its target. The missile is guided by an onboard radar. The interceptor, which weighs 1400 kg, may be effective up to one kilometer from a target.|$|R
5000|$|Several tests {{conducted}} {{as part of}} the Soviet Union's Istrebitel Sputnik programme in the 1970s and 80s, involving IS-A satellites intercepting {{and destroying}} IS-P, DS-P1-M and Lira <b>target</b> <b>satellites</b> launched specifically for the tests.|$|R
2500|$|The LTV Aerospace Altair 3 {{was used}} as the second stage of the ASM-135. The Altair 3 used the Thiokol FW-4S solid {{propellant}} rocket engine. The Altair 3 stage was also used as the fourth stage for the Scout rocket [...] and had been previously used in both the Bold Orion and HiHo anti-satellite weapons efforts. The Altair was equipped with hydrazine fueled thrusters {{that could be used to}} point the missile towards the <b>target</b> <b>satellite.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The MHV {{guidance}} system solely tracked {{targets in the}} field of view of the infrared sensor, but did not determine altitude, attitude, or range to the target. Direct Proportional Line of Sight guidance used information from the detector to maneuver and null out any line-of-sight change. A Bang-bang control system was used to fire 56 full charge [...] "divert" [...] and lower thrust 8 half charge [...] "end-game" [...] solid rocket motors arranged around the circumference of the MHV. The half charge 8 [...] "end-game" [...] motors were used to perform finer trajectory adjustments just prior to intercepting the <b>target</b> <b>satellite.</b> Four pods {{at the rear of the}} MHV contained small attitude control rocket motors. These motors were used to damp off center rotation by the MHV.|$|E
2500|$|After {{testing the}} over 5,000km Agni V missile, which {{went up to}} 600km into space during its {{parabolic}} trajectory, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) now feels it can fashion deadly anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons in double-quick time. Agni V gives you the boosting capability and the 'kill vehicle', with advanced seekers, {{will be able to}} home into the <b>target</b> <b>satellite,</b> DRDO chief, VK Saraswat said. The defence ministry in 2010 had even drafted a 15-year [...] "Technology Perspective and Roadmap", which held development of ASAT weapons [...] "for electronic or physical destruction of satellites in both LEO (2,000-km altitude above earth's surface) and the higher geosynchronous orbit" [...] as a thrust area in its long-term integrated perspective plan under the management of DRDO. Consequently, defence scientists are focusing on [...] "space security" [...] to protect India's space assets from electronic or physical destruction. Another spin-off from Agni V test is that the DRDO feels it can work towards launching mini-satellites for battlefield use if an adversary attacks the country's main satellites.|$|E
50|$|Space warfare is warfare {{that occurs}} outside the Earth's atmosphere. No wars have been fought here yet. The weapons would include orbital {{weaponry}} and space weapons. High value outer space <b>targets</b> would include <b>satellites</b> and weapon platforms.

50|$|The ETS-VII {{consists}} of two main parts; the chaser satellite and the <b>target</b> <b>satellite.</b> The chaser satellite is the main satellite body, and was named Hikoboshi. A 2 m long robotic arm was attached to this part. The smaller <b>target</b> <b>satellite</b> was named Orihime. The box shaped, complete satellite system weighed 2,860 kg. The ETS-VII was equipped with three solar panels, with two on the chaser satellite {{and one on the}} <b>target</b> <b>satellite.</b> The satellite was assisted by relative global positioning system (RGPS) navigation.|$|E
50|$|Three {{rendezvous}} docking {{operations were}} carried out with the ETS-VII, which involved placing the <b>target</b> <b>satellite</b> 200 mm away from the chaser and using the robot arm to retrieve and hold it in place. Several other experiments were also carried out with the satellite’s robotic components. Most of the robot experiments were successfully completed by March 1999, and <b>target</b> <b>satellite</b> handling experiments {{were carried out}} in May 1999.|$|E
50|$|The craft {{autonomously}} navigated via {{a series}} of orbit transfer maneuvers to reach the <b>target</b> <b>satellite.</b> No navigational information was relayed to the vehicle after launch; it navigated autonomously and with GPS.|$|E

50|$|The {{space segment}} was {{originally}} designed to consist of two functionally identical satellites that would launch together and separate on orbit in a target-inspector configuration. Once in orbit, CUSat would use microthrust Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) and sub-centimeter level accurate carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) to navigate the satellites to within ten meters of each other. The inspector satellite would use cameras to gather imagery of the <b>target</b> <b>satellite</b> while performing relative navigation. <b>Target</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery would {{be transferred to the}} ground segment, where they would be used to reconstruct a three-dimensional model for the end user.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} three satellite {{impact tests}} completed in early 2007 through collaboration between Kyushu University and the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. The previous experiments completed in late 2005 aimed to compare low- and hyper-velocity impacts on identical <b>target</b> <b>satellites,</b> whereas the new tests used larger <b>satellites</b> as <b>targets</b> and aimed {{to investigate the}} effects of impact directions. Three identical micro satellites equipped with fully-functional electronic devices were prepared as targets. Their dimensions were 20 cm by 20 cm by 20 cm, and the mass of each was approximately 1. 3 kilograms. Aluminum alloy solid spheres, with diameters of 3 cm and masses of 39 grams were prepared as projectiles. The impact velocity was approximately 1. 7 km/s. The impact tests were carried out at the two-stage light gas gun facility at the Kyushu Institute of Technology. All three <b>target</b> <b>satellites</b> were completely fragmented, but there were noticeable differences among the three sets of fragments due to the different impact directions. More than 1000 fragments from each test were collected, measured, photographed, and documented with material descriptions. The analysis of the fragments is currently in progress. Preliminary results of the new data and comparisons with previous data {{will be included in}} the paper...|$|R
