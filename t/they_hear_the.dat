The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger.

5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from the window in their room, <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E
5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case. After the Court considered both Heffernan's petition and the city's reply, it granted the petition {{on the first}} day of the 2015 term. Both parties consented to the filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the National Conference of State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an amicus brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at oral argument, which the Court granted, meaning the Solicitor General's office would be appearing at oral arguments, held on January 19, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. <b>They</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm.

25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} exposed a {{possible}} family feud over the chain's corporate leadership. Richard Boyd, one of In-N-Out's vice presidents and co-trustee of {{two-thirds of the}} company stock, accused Lynsi Martinez and allied corporate executives of trying to force out Esther Snyder and attempting to fire Boyd unreasonably. Pre-empting the suit, Martinez, Snyder and Taylor appeared in a December video message to employees, telling them not to believe everything <b>they</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>The</b> company then responded with a lawsuit of its own, alleging Boyd had construction work done on his personal property and charged it to the company, as well as favoring contractors with uncompetitive bids. Boyd was then suspended from his role as co-trustee and Northern Trust Bank of California took his place (as co-trustee) until a hearing set for May 10, 2006. However, in April, the judge dismissed two of In-N-Out's claims against Boyd. A trial date of October 17, 2006, was set but never occurred, and a settlement was reached out of court. Ultimately, Boyd was permanently removed from his role as an employee and co-trustee.|$|E

500|$|The title Neighborhoods evolved out of {{the trio}} {{discovering}} that each bring a very different aesthetic to the band, each like different neighborhoods in a city. [...] "Everybody in the world thinks of something unique unto themselves when <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> word 'Neighborhoods'," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "To some {{it is a big}} city, others a small town, others suburbia, everything. The world is wide, exciting and very different. That's what Neighborhoods means to me." [...] The album artwork for the record was revealed on August 4, 2011, featuring the band name written atop a city skyline. The Neighborhoods sleeve contains many names close to the band, including Chloe (DeLonge's pet Labrador Retriever), [...] Ava and Jon (DeLonge's daughter Ava Elizabeth and son Jonas Rocket), Jack (Hoppus' son), Landon, Alabama and Ati (Barker's son, daughter and step-daughter, Atiana), G!

500|$|Doofenshmirtz, {{back at his}} lair, ties Perry to a giant firecracker rocket, {{explaining}} that he will end the party with fireworks and kill Perry at the same time. When Vanessa arrives, however, she hates the [...] "girly" [...] theme Doofenshmirtz has chosen and sits down to mope at a table, fearing that this would embarrass {{her in front of}} her arriving goth friends. At Phineas and Ferb's house, Love Händel's rehearsal descends into infighting; sure that no one will want to hear them any more, the band are again on the verging of breaking up when <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> roar of the crowd. Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz mopes of failing another attempt of giving Vanessa a good party, so he decides to ignite Perry's rocket to cheer himself up, but Perry frees himself and a fight ensues, during which Doofenshmirtz becomes tied to the rocket by accident instead. At the same moment the band begins to play; Candace and Linda arrive home. Linda reunites with her husband, and eventually kiss, thanks to some motivation from Ferb, who yells to Lawrence to kiss her.|$|E
500|$|As the Doctor {{tries to}} {{ascertain}} the situation, the group is thrown into panic when <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> beast coming for Joe, and hide in rooms where Rita and Gibbis face their fears. The Doctor spies the Minotaur-like beast through a keyhole, just before Joe escapes from confinement and is killed. Howie soon becomes possessed after entering a room against the Doctor's warnings. The remaining group set up a trap to lure the beast into the hotel's hairdressing salon using Howie's voice, upon which the Doctor questions the trapped creature and learns it is in agony wishing for its end. The Doctor realises the hotel is really a prison for the creature, and the [...] "fears" [...] in each room are harmless illusions. Howie also escapes from the group, allowing the beast to escape and chase him down, killing him before the Doctor can save him. While exploring more of the hotel, both Amy and the Doctor are separately lured to look into two specific rooms, facing their own fears. Rita also begins to praise the monster, and after thanking the Doctor for trying to save her, follows the fate of Joe and Howie.|$|E

500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Williams from New York {{magazine}} {{described the}} song as sounding both throbbing {{as well as}} wistful. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of the BBC, noted of the track: [...] "full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big" [...] and compared it to other Madonna songs like [...] "Vogue", [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Tom Bishop from the BBC commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is [...] "merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has [...] "way too much Abba in it for its own good." [...] He went on to elaborate that [...] "he only reason I can think of {{for this to be}} chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's not even close to being one of the best songs on the record". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what [...] "'Hung Up' amounts to is a big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time <b>they</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and it sounds good on the radio, too". Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine declared that [...] "Hung Up" [...] and the next single [...] "Sorry" [...] might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] or [...] "Burning Up", but have the same modus operandi of being designed for [...] "sweaty up-all-night dancing". Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.|$|E
