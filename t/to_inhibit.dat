5|$|A new {{regulation}} {{added in}} 2013 that was enforced {{for the first}} time on 7 May 2014 is the prohibition of photographing marked ballot papers, which aims <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> voter intimidation.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{synthetic}} peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) was found <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> {{the expression of}} New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase, an enzyme that many drug-resistant bacteria use to destroy carbapenems.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> sensory {{irritation}} when applied topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium {{has been shown}} to accelerate the recovery rate of the epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> 5α-reductase, finasteride {{has also}} been found <b>to</b> competitively <b>inhibit</b> 5β-reductase (AKR1D1), although its affinity for the enzyme is substantially less than for 5α-reductase (an order of magnitude less than 5α-reductase type I) and hence {{is unlikely to be}} of clinical significance.|$|R
5000|$|Membrane protein E3 RID-alpha and {{membrane}} protein E3 RID-beta performs {{a variety of}} molecular functions that contribute <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> apoptosis.|$|R
50|$|Acarbose also blocks {{pancreatic}} alpha-amylase in addition <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen {{of the small}} intestine.|$|R
5|$|In some rare cases, {{a single}} amino acid {{change in a}} serpin's RCL alters its {{specificity}} to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the α1-antitrypsin serpin <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> thrombin, causing a bleeding disorder.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of {{mammalian}} chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in vitro, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), {{which is}} able <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> trypsin and chymotrypsin {{as well as}} several blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, in vitro feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.|$|E
5000|$|F. Dean Toste and {{co-workers}} [...] have used Robinson annulation {{in the total}} synthesis of (+)-Fawcettimine, a tetracyclic Lycopodium alkaloid that has potential application <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> the acetylcholine esterase.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> deiodinase enzymes, {{iopanoic acid}} {{is also a}} substrate of type 1 deiodinase. Iopanoic acid underwent monodeiodination {{in the presence of}} type 1 deiodinase in a microsomal mouse liver preparation.|$|R
5000|$|ACVR2B {{represents}} {{an alternative approach}} <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> myostatin. Not belonging to the antibody class of molecules, the ACVR2B protein drug is rather mimicking myostatin's endogenous binding partner, therefore competing for its binding affinity.|$|R
5|$|Sex steroids {{are known}} to affect the rate of sebum secretion; androgens such as {{testosterone}} {{have been shown to}} stimulate secretion, and estrogens have been shown <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> secretion. Dihydrotestosterone acts as the primary androgen in the prostate and in hair follicles.|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, the American National Archives stores {{important}} national documents {{such as the}} Declaration of Independence and the Constitution within argon-filled cases <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> their degradation. Argon {{is preferable}} to the helium {{that had been used}} in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.|$|E
5|$|The {{evacuation}} was code-named Operation Ke (ケ号作戦), and {{was scheduled}} to begin on 14 January 1943. An important element in the plan was an air superiority campaign starting 28 January 1943, <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> Allied aircraft or warships from disrupting {{the final stage of}} the Ke operation, which was the actual evacuation of all Japanese troops from Guadalcanal.|$|E
40|$|It {{was found}} that {{exposure}} of hemagglutinating sera to pressures {{of the order of}} 3, 000 to 4, 000 atmospheres destroyed their agglutinating power, but did not convert them <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> ("blocking") antibodies. Higher pressures (4, 500 to 5, 500 atmospheres) were required <b>to</b> destroy <b>inhibiting</b> anti-Rh 0 antibodies in a "blocking" serum. This conforms with ideas already held that the "blocking" antibodies are significantly more stable than the agglutinating antibodies...|$|R
50|$|SoRI-9804 is a {{positive}} allosteric modulator of dopamine transporters. Unlike others in its series & traditional DRI ligands, it inhibits the release of dopamine in addition <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> the reuptake of released dopamine back into the transporter.|$|R
50|$|There is some, albeit mixed, {{in vitro}} {{evidence}} that the antidepressant and modestly selective DRI amineptine may in addition <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> the reuptake of dopamine selectively induce the presynaptic release of dopamine without affecting that of norepinephrine or serotonin.|$|R
5|$|Three azo- and azoxyformamides {{compounds}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from the puffball and tested {{for their ability}} <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> the growth of plants: 4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide, 4-methoxybenzene-1-azoformamide, and 4-hydroxybenzene-1-azoformamide. Only the first compound was significantly inhibitory, suggesting {{that the presence of}} the azoxy moiety is required for growth inhibition.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
30|$|Asphaltene dispersants (ADs) are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} additives {{which can be used}} to control asphaltene deposition (Oschmann 2002). They have been successfully applied <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> and removing asphaltene deposits as a formation squeeze, batch, or continuous injection (Manek 1995).|$|R

40|$|Single {{applications}} of either 6 -benzyladenine or zeatin <b>to</b> <b>inhibited</b> axillary buds of intact, light-grown seedlings of Pisum sativum L. cv Black-eyed Susan, {{resulted in the}} formation of rapidly elongating, leafy shoots. Similar treatment with kinetin or isopentenyladenine caused only limited but outgrowth which stopped 6 days after application...|$|R
5|$|At {{least two}} {{different}} types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> enzymes {{needed for the}} {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
40|$|Objective alpha-Conotoxin Vc 1. 1 {{is a small}} disulfide-bonded peptide {{from the}} venom of the marine cone snail Conus victoriae. Vc 1. 1 has antinociceptive actions in animal models of neuropathic pain, but its {{applicability}} <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuroexcitability and reducing chronic visceral pain (CVP) is unknown...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> gene expression, splicing ribozymes {{can be used}} {{to repair}} damaged or defective RNA. Splicing ribozymes catalyze RNA splicing, removing a section of RNA that contains a mutation and replacing it with well-functioning RNA.Existing ribozymes can also be altered in a way that changes the reaction(s) that the ribozyme catalyzes.|$|R
2500|$|Resorcinol is also {{a common}} {{scaffold}} that is found {{in a class of}} anticancer agents, some of which (luminespib, ganetespib, KW-2478, and onalespib) were in clinical trials as of 2014. [...] Part of the resorcinol structure binds <b>to</b> <b>inhibits</b> the N-terminal domain of heat shock protein 90, which is a drug target for anticancer treatments.|$|R
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Folding@home {{found several}} small drug {{candidates}} which appear <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> the toxicity of Aβ aggregates. In 2010, in close {{cooperation with the}} Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on biological tissue. In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several mutations of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of Aβ oligomers. Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in {{people who have had}} a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40mg of aspirin a day is able <b>to</b> <b>inhibit</b> a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.|$|E

5000|$|FtsZ {{polymerization}} is also {{linked to}} stressors like DNA damage. DNA damage induces {{a variety of}} proteins to be manufactured, one of them called SulA. [...] SulA prevents the polymerization and GTPase activity of FtsZ. SulA accomplishes this task by binding to self-recognizing FtsZ sites. By sequestering FtsZ, the cell can directly link DNA damage <b>to</b> <b>inhibiting</b> cell division.|$|R
