5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita {{subgenus}} Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E
