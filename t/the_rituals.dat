5|$|Further {{light is}} shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by {{multiple}} documents which appear to detail <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri {{from the time}} of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a recitation of a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and sealing the shrine {{at the end of the}} day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.|$|E

The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them.

5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where <b>the</b> <b>rituals</b> were carried out.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other.

Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults.

5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen.

The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost.

The childbirth and child-rearing rituals in Uygur culture usually consist of four rituals: <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> of birth, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> of naming, <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> of cradle, and <b>the</b> <b>ritual</b> of circumcision for boys. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> of birth has its origin in traditional folk belief and is disappearing in cities. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> of giving children a name has its origin in Islamic doctrine and is held on 7 th day after birth. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> of <b>the</b> cradle is held on 40 th day after birth. People put the baby into a new cradle and pray his healthy developing. <b>The</b> <b>ritual</b> of circumcision for boys is very important Islamic ritual in which 6 or 7 years old boys have a small operation in their genital as Muslim symbol. The findings of this field-research is that {{the system of the}} recipe knowledge, i. e. what peple must know to act competently (in accord with expected standards) in routine situations of everyday life, in terms of the holding and performing of these rituals is appears to be changing under the process of modernization and developing of a market economy in China.
