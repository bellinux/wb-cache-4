5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> was partly dissipated in the load but also partly stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E

50|$|From the 8th century BCE to {{as late as}} the 2nd century CE an inland trading society {{emerged on}} the Xieng Khouang Plateau, near Lao’s most {{remarkable}} megalithic remains on a site called <b>the</b> Plain of <b>Jars.</b> <b>The</b> Plain of <b>Jars</b> was nominated to the tentative list as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992, and unexploded ordnance has continued to be removed from the site since 1998. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> are stone sarcophagi dating from the early Iron Age (500BCE to 800CE) and contained evidence of human remains, burial goods and ceramics. Some sites contain more than 250 individual <b>jars.</b> <b>The</b> tallest <b>jars</b> are more than 3 meters in height. Little is known about the megalithic culture which produced <b>the</b> <b>jars,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> and prevalence of iron ore in the region suggest that people who created the site grew wealthy from overland trade routes.|$|R
50|$|No further archaeological {{research}} was conducted until November 1994, when Professor Eiji Nitta of the Kagoshima University and Lao archaeologist Thongsa Sayavongkhamdy surveyed and mapped Site 1. Nitta claimed that the surrounding burial pits were contemporaneous to <b>the</b> <b>jars,</b> {{as they had been}} cut into the surface on which <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> had been placed. Nitta believed <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were symbolic monument to mark the surrounding burials. He dated <b>the</b> Plain of <b>Jars</b> to <b>the</b> late second or early first millennium B.C. based on the burial urn and associated grave goods. Sayavongkhamdy undertook surveys and excavations between 1994 and 1996, supported by the Australian National University. Sayavongkhamdy and Peter Bellwood interpreted <b>the</b> stone <b>jars</b> as a central person's primary or secondary burial, surrounded by secondary burials of family members. Archaeological data collected during bomb clearance operations supervised by UNESCO archaeologist Julie Van Den Bergh in 2004-2005 and again in 2007 provided similar archaeological results. Like Nitta, Van Den Bergh concluded that <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> and surrounding burials were contemporaneous.|$|R
5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja {{on the night of}} Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja night, he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> of Divine Mother's sanctified water on his head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from <b>the</b> <b>jar...</b> In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes <b>the</b> <b>jar,</b> helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous boat-shaped burial found in the Philippines is <b>the</b> Manunggul <b>Jar.</b> <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> were {{excavated}} from a Neolithic burial site in Manunggul cave of Tabon Caves at Lipuun Point at Palawan. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> {{were found to be}} from 890-710 B.C.

5000|$|Lao legends tell {{of a race}} of giants who {{inhabited}} the area and who were ruled by a king, named Khun Cheung, who fought a long and ultimately victorious battle against an enemy. He supposedly created <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> to brew and store huge amounts of lau hai ("lau" [...] means [...] "alcohol", [...] "hai" [...] means [...] "jar"—So [...] "lau hai" [...] means rice beer or rice wine in <b>the</b> <b>jars)</b> to celebrate his victory. Another local story states that <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were molded from natural materials including clay, sand, sugar, and animal products in a type of stone mix. This led the locals to believe the cave at Site 1 was actually a kiln, and that <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were fired there and are not actually hewn from stone.|$|R
50|$|The chamber {{also held}} 28 large storage jars, {{approximately}} 75 cm tall, made from both pottery and alabaster. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> weighed in at around 40 or 43 kg (90-95 pounds), varying slightly {{in size and}} weight. Three of them {{appear to have been}} broken in antiquity at the rim or lower neck. Most of <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were discovered with intact lids, but did not bear pharaonic seal impressions. Shortly after their manufacture, <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were whitewashed while standing in sand, and the bottoms show the original clay. A large ostracon, not identified to have come from one of <b>the</b> storage <b>jars</b> at this time, was discovered and broken during the modern opening of the tomb.|$|R

25|$|Thomson first {{investigated}} the magnetic deflection of cathode rays.

Thomson detected their path by the fluorescence on a squared screen in <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> He found that whatever the material of the anode and the gas in <b>the</b> <b>jar,</b> the deflection of the rays was the same, suggesting that the rays were of the same form whatever their origin.|$|E

50|$|Generally once he hits {{that range}} on his weight indicator, he waits while <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> open to <b>the</b> less {{restricted}} point, whereupon the sinker bar travels upwards rapidly, providing an upwards {{hit on the}} downhole tools. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> can then be 'reset' by lowering the line until {{the weight of the}} sinker bar closes, or pushes the inner mandrel of <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>jars</b> back to <b>the</b> starting position. Because <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>jars</b> are designed to provide a wait time to allow the operator to get up to the desired line tension, they can provide a very effective upwards hit.|$|R

25|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into a jar, and the steel lid {{is placed on}} top of <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> with the {{integral}} rubber seal resting {{on the rim of}} <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John Landis Mason and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1883 {{that the cause of}} the Doterel {{explosion}} was settled. A surviving crew member of that ship, upon later smelling xerotine siccative while on board , stated that he had smelled it before the 1881 explosion. He explained to authorities that a jar of liquid had cracked while being moved below deck. Subsequent investigation revealed that just before the explosion in Doterel, two men were ordered to throw <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> overboard. While cleaning the leaking explosive liquid from beneath the forward magazine, the men may have broken the rule of not having an open flame below decks. The xerotine siccative exploded first, setting off the huge explosion in the forward magazine, which contained 4 tons and 7 cwt (4,456kg) of explosives.|$|E
25|$|While {{the residue}} in <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> is not {{definitive}} proof of winemaking, it does provide strong {{evidence for the}} possibility. Grapes are unique in {{being one of the}} few natural sources for tartaric acid, which is the most abundant acid in wine and often crystallizes into deposits that are left in containers that have held wine. Grapes also have a natural propensity to break down into alcohol by a process that we now know as fermentation where the yeast on the grape skins metabolize the sugar in the grapes into alcohol. This happens most readily in a close container that is kept in room temperature. Whether or not the action was deliberate, storing grapes in jars that were then embedded in the floor would have created conditions favorable for wine production.|$|E

50|$|A cave {{located at}} Site 1 {{is a natural}} {{limestone}} formation with an opening to the northwest and two man-made holes at the top.

French geologist and amateur archaeologist Madeleine Colani excavated inside the cave in the early 1930s and found material to support a crematorium theory. Colani also recorded and excavated at 12 Plain of Jars sites and published two volumes with her findings in 1935. Colani concluded that <b>the</b> Plain of <b>Jars</b> was an Iron Age burial site. Inside <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> she found, embedded in black organic soil, coloured glass beads, burnt teeth and bone fragments, sometimes from more than one individual. Around <b>the</b> stone <b>jars,</b> she found human bones, pottery fragments, iron and bronze objects, glass and stone beads, ceramic weights and charcoal. The bone and teeth inside <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> show signs of cremation, while the burials surrounding <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> yield unburnt secondary burial bones.|$|R
