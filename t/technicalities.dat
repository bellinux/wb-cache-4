According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the <b>technicalities</b> of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous. Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{were divided}} on Good Girl Gone Bad Live; they praised the show, dancers, Rihanna's vocals and {{contrast}} {{levels of the}} video, however, there was criticism towards some <b>technicalities</b> including the close-up frames. At the 2009 Grammy Awards, the video album received a Grammy nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Commercially, Good Girl Gone Bad Live peaked within the top-ten in nine countries, including at number one in Austria and Switzerland. On the US Billboard Music DVD Chart it peaked at number six and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 25,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded is {{the third}} box set by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk. It was released on 27 June 2006 through One Little Indian. It {{is a collection of}} seven of her studio albums, issued in the DualDisc format—one side contains the original longplayers, while the other one includes their remastered versions in surround sound, in tandem with music videos and additional features. While the box set did not impact any record charts, music critics gave mixed to positive reviews to Surrounded. Most of them were positive towards its packaging and affirmed it was an effective showcase of Björk's catalogue. Nonetheless, criticism was targeted towards its opportunistic nature and <b>technicalities.</b>|$|E
50|$|Judges {{evaluate}} the showcase round on two main elements, artistry and <b>technicality,</b> {{each of which}} includes several criteria. The artistry element includes theme, music, synchronicity, and choreography, among others. The <b>technicality</b> element includes toprock, uprock, footwork, and power moves, among others.|$|R

40|$|The language-gap, {{for example}} between lowliteracy laypersons and highly-technical expert documents, is a {{fundamental}} barrier for cross-domain knowledge transfer. This paper seeks {{to close the gap}} at the thematic level via topic adaptation, i. e., adjusting the topical structures for cross-domain documents according to a domain factor such as <b>technicality.</b> We present a probabilistic model for this purpose based on joint modeling of topic and <b>technicality.</b> The proposed τLDA model explicitly encodes the interplay between topic and <b>technicality</b> hierarchies, providing an effective topic-level bridge between lay and expert documents. We demonstrate the usefulness of τLDA with an application to consumer medical informatics. ...|$|R
5|$|An {{image of}} one of Onyx's early prototypes {{surfaced}} online, with a similar hardware to the 9000's, including the same trackball. That prototype was early reviewed by website CrackBerry, which confirmed diverse details about the device, such as the 480×360 display, the 3.2 megapixels camera and connectivity features—Wi-Fi and GPS. The same day, other information regarding <b>technicalities</b> were revealed on a surfaced AT filesheet about the smartphone. Already known as the BlackBerry 9020 and having started production, {{a photo of the}} device surfaced, though it replaced the trackball with a trackpad. A previous prototype with a trackball was put up for sale on eBay, where it passed the mark of $600; four days later, a pre-launch list of then-upcoming smartphones for AT surfaced online on August 9, 2009, which listed the device. A T-Mobile press image was leaked on September 8.|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the <b>technicalities</b> of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an Industrial Tribunal five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal <b>technicalities</b> caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E

They play death metal and incorporate melody and <b>technicality</b> without losing heaviness. They take influence from classical music, progressive metal and thrash metal as well. Lyrically, they deal with scientific themes, exploring things like the theory of evolution and biology, physics, cryonics, dyson spheres, the probability of alien life in the universe, stem cell research, and artificial intelligence. Allegaeon is also noted for their <b>technicality</b> - In fact, their earlier work was criticized for being almost too technical, but by the time [...] "Elements of the Infinite" [...] was released, critics noted a near-perfect balance of <b>technicality</b> and catchy songs.|$|R

40|$|Beyond {{labeling}} {{it easier}} to process than other types, few researchers who use technical text in their work try to define what it is. This paper describes a study that investigates the character of texts typically considered technical. We identify 42 features of a text considered likely to correlate with its degree of <b>technicality.</b> These include both objectively verifiable measures like marked presence of interrogative or imperative sentences which are akin to the criteria used by Biber inVariation Across Speech and Writing, and subjective measures such as presence of hierarchical organization. All are less ambiguous than <b>technicality,</b> so our inventory may be suited to use in a procedure that classifies text as technical or non-technical. An inventory organizing and describing these lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse features was used to rate nine varied sample texts. Analysis of 22 ratings of each text indicated that 31 features in the inventory were meaningful predictors of text <b>technicality</b> when considered independently. The inventory has been revised and a formula to compute <b>technicality</b> has been developed {{in the light of}} these findings. 1...|$|R
