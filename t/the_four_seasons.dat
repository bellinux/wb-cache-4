5|$|One of Fox's {{earliest}} supporters was Isadore Sharp, {{founder of}} <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Seasons</b> Hotels. Sharp {{had lost his}} own son to cancer and offered Fox and his companions free accommodation at his hotels. He donated $10,000 and challenged 999 other businesses to do the same. Sharp also proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox's name. Fox agreed, but insisted that the runs be non-competitive. There were to be no winners or losers, and anyone who participated could run, walk or ride. Sharp faced opposition to the project. The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes. Sharp persisted, and he, <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Seasons</b> Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13, 1981.|$|E

5|$|By astronomical convention, <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>seasons</b> can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} ten years the city has {{experienced}} an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Seasons</b> Hotel Amman, Sheraton Hotel Amman, Fairmont Amman, St. Regis Hotel Amman, Le Royal Hotel and others.|$|E

5|$|In the Gros Islet Quarter on St. Lucia, rough seas damaged a jetty and {{grounded}} a yacht. In Soufrière, four {{homes were}} destroyed by the storm surge, which also made some areas impassible. The storm surge also flooded parts of the Anse la Raye Quarter, leading to officials declaring a mandatory evacuation of the area. On Montserrat, very little damage was reported. A few minor landslides occurred in rural areas; no impact was caused by them. On Nevis there was relatively little damage although the beachfront part of <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Seasons</b> Resort was severely damaged and was subsequently closed for an extended period. Throughout St. Kitts and Nevis, damage was estimated at $19million.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by the Chinese Song and Yuan dynasties, Japanese {{monochrome}} ink painting called suibokuga largely replaced polychrome scroll paintings. By {{the end of}} the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) {{became the}} preferred genre for Zen painters, evolving to a unique Japanese style from the Chinese origin. Shūbun, who created Reading in a Bamboo Grove (1446), and his student Sesshū, author of Landscape of <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Seasons,</b> are the most well known priest-painters of the period. As with most of the early Japanese paintings, these works were created for Buddhist temples. At {{the end of the}} Muromachi period around 1573, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries, and was practised by artists from the Kanō school.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location in the}} Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, with each of <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>seasons</b> having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of}} the state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the warm summer great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 2014, James {{opted out}} of his {{contract}} with the Heat and officially became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated {{that he intended to}} return to the Cavaliers.

A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Seasons</b> Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
