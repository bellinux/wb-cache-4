5|$|Iron ore {{quarrying}} {{was a major}} {{industry in}} and around Wellingborough from the 1860s until the 1960s. James Rixon and Wiliam Ashwell opened a major ironworks {{on the north side}} of the town in 1870, supplied by the extensive ironstone quarries around Finedon to the east of the town. Three narrow gauge tramways served the iron ore industry, the Wellingborough <b>Tramway,</b> Neilson's <b>Tramway</b> and the Finedonhill <b>Tramway.</b> The Wellingborough <b>Tramway</b> served Rixon's ironworks until 1966.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the <b>Tramway</b> as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the <b>Tramway</b> and the main line with the intention of forcing the <b>Tramway</b> out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the <b>Tramway,</b> causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the <b>Tramway,</b> and in one meeting Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of housing}} in the Smestad area started after Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES) {{established}} a <b>tramway</b> from the city center to Majorstuen in 1894. Four years later, fund-raising started to build the Aker Avenue towards Smestad, but the recession made fund-raising difficult. The plans were launched again in 1904, and subsequently revised in 1908, by which time they including a <b>tramway</b> along the avenue. In 1910, A. S. Guldberg, Iver Lycke, W. Munthes-Kaas and H. A. Mørk applied for a concession to build a <b>tramway</b> along the route. This was granted by the municipal council in Aker on 26 May. The four individuals then transferred their rights to the municipality, who started negotiating rights with KES, and Holmenkolbanen—the latter who had a suburban <b>tramway</b> running from Majorstuen, the Holmenkollen Line.|$|E
50|$|Scarborough Corporation {{obtained}} parliamentary powers {{under the}} Scarborough <b>Tramways</b> Act 1902 to operate <b>tramways</b> in the town. The Scarborough <b>Tramways</b> Company was formed under this Act {{to build and}} work the <b>tramways.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the <b>Tramway</b> needed {{to pass along}} the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had to raise prices to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the <b>Tramway</b> and the unreliable engines had given the <b>Tramway</b> a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{construction}} of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a <b>tramway</b> from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another <b>tramway</b> was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, so that there would be a <b>tramway</b> link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E

50|$|The Manchester Carriage and <b>Tramways</b> Company was {{incorporated}} in 1880, {{the result of}} a merger of the Manchester Suburban <b>Tramways</b> Company and the Manchester Carriage Company, to provide horse-drawn tram services throughout Manchester and Salford, England, and surrounding districts. Although the 1870 <b>Tramways</b> Act authorised local authorities to construct <b>tramways,</b> it prevented them from operating tram services, so the <b>tramways</b> were leased out to private companies who operated them on their behalf. Those companies also had the right to construct their own <b>tramways.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Duke of Buckingham built a short horse-drawn <b>tramway</b> to {{transport}} goods between his estates at Wotton and a terminus {{adjacent to the}} station. He extended it soon afterwards to provide a passenger service {{to the town of}} Brill, and the <b>tramway</b> was converted to locomotive operation, known as the Brill <b>Tramway.</b> All goods to and from the Brill <b>Tramway</b> passed through Quainton Road, making it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation, and traffic increased further when construction began on Ferdinand de Rothschild's mansion of Waddesdon Manor. The plan of extending the Brill <b>Tramway</b> to Oxford, which would have made Quainton Road a major junction station, was abandoned. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the Brill <b>Tramway</b> were absorbed by London's Metropolitan Railway (MR), which already operated the line from Aylesbury to London. The MR rebuilt Quainton Road and re-sited it to a more convenient location, allowing through running between the Brill <b>Tramway</b> and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. When the Great Central Railway (GCR) from the north of England opened, Quainton Road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met, and by far the busiest of the MR's rural stations.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve the}} growing {{population}} of the council estate, the Middleton Light Railway, an electric <b>tramway,</b> was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation. The <b>tramway</b> from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and then headed south through Middleton Woods to a terminus on the Ring Road. The <b>tramway</b> {{was made into a}} circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet. The <b>tramway</b> closed in 1959. Its route through the park is now a footpath.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} {{slowed to a}} halt. Private motoring had arrived {{to put an end}} to its monopoly. The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and above all the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the <b>tramway</b> to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen <b>tramway</b> came to the Norman capital.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the closure}} of the {{original}} London tram network in 1952, Holborn provided an interchange between trams and tubes, via the underground Holborn <b>tramway</b> station located a little distance south of the underground railway station. This was the only part of London with an underground tram system, and Holborn <b>tramway</b> station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, though with no public access.|$|E

5|$|By 1898, American {{financier}} Charles Tyson Yerkes {{had made}} a large fortune developing the electric <b>tramway</b> and elevated railway systems in Chicago, but his questionable business methods, which included bribery and blackmail, had finally drawn the disapproving attention of the public. Yerkes had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the city council and Illinois state legislature into granting him a 100-year franchise for the <b>tramway</b> system. Following a public backlash, he sold his Chicago investments and {{turned his attention to}} opportunities in London.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{additional}} trams {{were built}} by Strømmen as series two. The first vehicle was delivered on 4 August 1989 {{and was taken}} into service on 11 October, while the last was put into service on 27 August 1990. These were numbered 126 through 140. From 7 September 1990 to 1 February 1991, tram 140 was used on the <b>tramway</b> in Chemnitz, Germany. Following this delivery, all lines of the <b>tramway</b> used SL79, although there were still many other trams needed to supplement the new trams. During the summer of 1995, tram no. 137 was used on the Djurgården Line of the heritage <b>tramway</b> in Stockholm, Sweden. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing {{the operation of the}} <b>tramway</b> and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Forskningsparken is a {{rapid transit}} {{station on the}} Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro. It {{also serves as a}} light rail station for the Ullevål Hageby Line of the Oslo <b>Tramway.</b> It is located at the north of the Blindern campus of the University of Oslo in the Nordre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway. The {{decision}} to build the station was made in 1998, and it opened in 1999, replacing the former station Vestgrensa, and allowed interchange between the metro and the <b>tramway.</b> The Ullevål Hageby Line was at the same time extended to serve the new Rikshospitalet. Forskningsparken is served by lines 3, 4 and 6 of the metro, each operating every 15minutes and providing services along both the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line. Lines 17 and 18 of the <b>tramway</b> serve Forskningsparken, operating to Rikshospitalet and the city center.|$|E
5|$|From the {{northern}} terminus, a <b>tramway</b> connected the canal to iron works at Aberdare and Hirwaun. This {{was built in}} 1803, and included an incline just north of Glynneath, which was powered by a high-pressure Trevithick steam engine. The Tappenden brothers had bought into the iron industry in 1802, and built the <b>tramway</b> because of high tolls on the Glamorganshire Canal, but by 1814 they were bankrupt, and had no further connections with the canal.|$|E

5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. As a result, the Brill <b>Tramway</b> {{became a part of}} the London Underground. The management of London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and the improvement of passenger services in London, and saw little possibility that the former Metropolitan Railway routes in Buckinghamshire could ever become viable passenger routes. In 1935 all services on the Brill <b>Tramway</b> were withdrawn, and the line was closed. The infrastructure of the route was dismantled and sold shortly afterwards. Very little trace of the Brill <b>Tramway</b> remains, other than the former junction station at Quainton Road, now the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} {{gradually}} close the <b>tramway.</b> New trams had been delivered in 1958, {{and it was}} decided that lines would only be closed as trams were naturally retired. At the time Oslo Sporveier had 421 vehicles. By 1974, the company had 163 vehicles, of which 100 were powered trams, 43 were trailers and 20 were working trailers. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the political climate changed, and in 1977 the city council decided to not close the <b>tramway</b> anyway. Between 1978 and 1981, ten tram vehicles were bought from the Gothenburg <b>Tramway.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{the city}} council changed their {{decision}} to close down the <b>tramway.</b> The main reason was the 1973 oil crisis, which had made it cheaper to run hydroelectric-powered trams than diesel-powered buses. After no investment on the <b>tramway</b> for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used M-23 units from the Gothenburg <b>Tramway</b> in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five SL79 articulated trams were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990. Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.|$|E
