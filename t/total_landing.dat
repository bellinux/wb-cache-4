Differences in size structure and growth curves suggest that different population units exist among these rivers, requiring individualized evaluation and fisheries management strategies. The analysis of the yield per recruit does not indicate overexploitation. However, the highest relative exploitation rate was observed in the Madeira river.

The optimum airspeed was between the reference airspeed and the reference airspeed plus 10 knots. The optimum flare initiation altitude range for unrestricted landings was from 11 meters to 20 meters (36 feet to 66 feet), and the landing time in the optimum window was 8 seconds.
