Del Potro is very superstitious, and after suffering a wrist injury shortly after switching to <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> BLX Pro Tour paint job in 2010, he returned to playing with the then outdated Wilson K-Factor 6.1 95 paint job. He particularly favored the exact racquets he had used to win his only Grand Slam title at the 2009 US Open. He again refused to update his racquet to <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> BLX Juice Pro in 2012, and in 2014 {{had only a few}} K-Factor racquets left. For strings, he uses Luxilon ALU Power strung at 58 lbs.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E

Heath appointed Douglas-Home to head the department, with, once again, a second cabinet minister, this time Anthony Barber, principally responsible, as Heath {{had been in the}} 1960s, for negotiations on Britain's joining the EEC. This time, however, both ministers were in the Commons; Barber's cabinet post was officially Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E

Annie and Dixon struggle to adjust to their new lives while making new friends and adhering to their parents' wishes.|$|E
5|$|The three episodes {{were tied}} {{together}} by {{the story of a}} murdered Haitian domestic worker employed by wealthy philanthropist Felix Wilson, played by Jones. Protagonists Frank Pembleton and Al Giardello initially refuse to properly investigate <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> family out of respect for their success and contributions to the African American community of Baltimore, which leads to tensions and accusations of discrimination within the police department. The storyline serves as a rumination and commentary on racism and classism, even when they come from the best of intentions.|$|E

5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was {{out of step with}} his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop on the issue of whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{initiated}} {{the construction of}} a 1.4 GeV synchrotron in 1952. As he had foreseen in 1948, it produced artificial K mesons and rho mesons, and tested quantum electrodynamics at short distances. The last machine he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), built between 1977 and 1999. It is located in what is now known as <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> Synchrotron Laboratory.|$|E

After the end of World War I, the ship was returned to the East Asiatic Company, the parent company of the Russian American Line, who placed her on their Baltic American Line sailing in roundtrip passenger service to New York under the name Estonia. She was sold to the Polish Gdynia America Line in 1930, and renamed SS Pułaski the following year for Polish passenger service to North and South America.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 Uptown {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district. The Uptown site west of <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those concerned for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago Housing Authority. Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P. Chapman of the Uptown Peoples Law Center.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic {{presidential nomination}} in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, {{he did not}} announce his support, fearing that his message might not resonate with Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote address and temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled <b>the</b> <b>Wilson</b> administration and denounced {{more than a decade}} of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.|$|E
