2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds {{clashed with}} Maj. Gen. Hooker, his {{predecessor}} at I Corps, but {{by this time}} the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker's nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat. Reynolds, who had gone to sleep after giving his proxy vote to Meade, woke up and muttered loud enough for Hooker to hear, [...] "What was the use of calling us together at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> when he intended to retreat anyhow?" [...] The 17,000-man I Corps was not engaged at Chancellorsville and suffered only 300 casualties during the entire campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The boys run out {{to watch}} the {{carnival}} arrive {{at three in the}} morning. As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. Mr. Holloway talks about <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>night</b> as [...] "soul's midnight," [...] when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and they encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to put them down, introducing himself as Mr. Dark and tells them the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel. [...] They run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock- he is twelve years old.|$|E

60|$|All at once {{twilight}} settled quickly {{down upon}} the willow brake, or else Duane noted it suddenly. He imagined it {{to be caused by}} the approaching storm.

This was unexpected at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the <b>night,</b> but convenient as a guide. By a turn of the screw and a touch of the helm he sheered the Sissie alongside Bamtz’s wharf—a miserable structure of a dozen piles and a few planks, of which the ex-vagabond was very proud. A couple of Kalashes jumped down on it, took a turn with the ropes thrown to them round the posts, and the Sissie came to rest without a single loud word or the slightest noise. And just in time too, for the tide turned even before she was properly moored.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nobody," [...] confessed Anne. [...] "Diana and I just {{imagined}} the wood was haunted. All the places around here are so--so--COMMONPLACE. We just got this {{up for our}} own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it's so gloomy. Oh, we have {{imagined the}} most harrowing things. There's a white lady walks along the brook just about <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the <b>night</b> and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when {{there is to be}} a death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And there's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn't go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. I'd be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Six Days on the Road is {{the title}} of the twelfth studio album {{released}} by the American country music band Sawyer Brown. It was released in 1997 (see 1997 in country music) on Curb Records. Its title track and lead-off single is a cover of the Dave Dudley hit from 1963. This cover reached number 13 on the Billboard country charts. Following this song was another cover, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> [...] "This <b>Night</b> Won't Last Forever", which was a pop hit for Bill LaBounty in 1978 and later for Michael Johnson in 1979. Sawyer Brown's cover was a number 6 country hit in late 1997. Also released from this album were [...] "Another Side" [...] and [...] "Small Talk", both of which failed to make the country Top 40.|$|R
60|$|Jacques speedily skinned the deer, cut {{a couple}} of steaks from its flank, and placing them on wooden spikes, stuck them up to roast, while his young friend put on a dry shirt, and hung his coat before the blaze. The goose which had been shot {{earlier in the day}} was also plucked, split open, impaled {{in the same manner as}} the steaks, and set up to roast. By <b>this</b> <b>time</b> the shadows <b>of</b> <b>night</b> had deepened, and ere long all was {{shrouded}} in gloom, except the circle of ruddy light around the camp fire, in the centre of which Jacques and Charley sat, with the canoe at their backs, knives in their hands, and the two spits, on the top of which smoked their ample supper, planted in the ground before them.|$|R

60|$|By <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> {{the shades}} <b>of</b> <b>night</b> had {{materially}} thickened, and, although the hour was still early, a darkness {{had come over}} the valley that rendered it difficult to distinguish objects at any distance from the eye. The obscurity made it necessary that they, who now issued from {{the door of the}} dwelling, should advance with caution, lest, ere properly admonished of its presence, their persons should be exposed to some lurking danger. When the three, however, were safely established behind the thick curtain of plank and earth that covered and commanded the entrance, and where their persons, from the shoulders downward, were completely protected, alike from shot and arrow, Content demanded to know, who applied at his gates for admission at an hour when they were habitually closed for the <b>night.</b> Instead <b>of</b> receiving, as before, a ready answer, the silence was so profound, that his own words were very distinctly heard repeated, as was not uncommon at that quiet hour, among the recesses of the neighboring woods.|$|R
