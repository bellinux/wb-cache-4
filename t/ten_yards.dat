5|$|The Aggies {{broke the}} losing streak in 1910 with a stalemate, 11–11. In {{the final minutes}} of the game, Hopkins was on the Maryland eight-yard line, second down with two yards to go. A Johns Hopkins guard named Schrieber then ran from the field to their bench to leave a knocked-out tooth for safekeeping. The referee penalized the Blue and Black <b>ten</b> <b>yards,</b> and when their field goal attempt was blocked, the game ended in a tie.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Virginia Tech dominated, intercepting {{the ball}} three times, forcing a fumble once, and earning one {{defensive}} touchdown. Two Louisville defenders {{had the best}} individual performances during the game, however. Brandon Johnson and Abe Brown had six tackles apiece, and Brown sacked Marcus Vick once for a loss of <b>ten</b> <b>yards.</b> The sack {{was one of three}} earned by the Louisville offense during the game. Virginia Tech's defense earned two sacks during the game, and the Hokies' leading tackler was Vince Hall, who recorded four and two assists on sacks of Louisville's Hunter Cantwell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight {{played their}} first show with Moreschi {{clad in a}} {{combination}} of football gear and punk rock clothing. After receiving positive feedback the band decided to become more serious. <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight began performing on the East Coast.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight was a {{straight}} edge, football-based band formed in 1995 in Boston, Massachusetts. Along with In My Eyes and Floorpunch, they spearheaded the youth crew revival in 1997. <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight's [...] "official" [...] last show was in Boston on October 17, which {{would become the}} first National Edge Day. They would later play additional shows with partial lineups.|$|R

5|$|The Baptists had {{sustained}} {{injuries in}} its opening {{game against the}} Georgia Bulldogs, and their practice schedule was hampered by rain. Near {{the end of the}} first quarter, Godchaux finally got off a good punt to Mercer's 10-yard line and Tom Ryan made the tackle. Godchaux returned Mercer's punt <b>ten</b> <b>yards,</b> beginning a drive gaining six yards off-tackle. On the next play Doc Kuhn passed to Tot McCullough for twelve yards and first down on the nine-yard line. Rupert Smith ran to the five-yard line, and then to the two. Red Williams fumbled on the next play, but it was recovered by Alf Sharpe in the end zone.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Jason Hamacher, also {{a member}} of Frodus, joined as their new drummer and they {{released}} their second full-length album entitled Until the End. This album was released on Conversion Records in the United States and again on Lost & Found Records in Europe and featured another 7 Seconds cover Young Till I Die. Ben Chused then departed to play drums in the Boston hardcore punk band, <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight, and was replaced by Graham Land who had played guitar in Worlds Collide and founded Better Than a Thousand with Ken Olden and Ray Cappo, the singer of Youth of Today. The band then toured the United States with <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight as well as Europe with Damnation A.D.|$|R
5000|$|Having sold 1,000 demos, <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight {{teamed up}} with Big Wheel Recreation to release the Hardcore Pride 7" [...] in 1996. The initial {{pressing}} sold out {{in less than a}} week, helping generate a buzz that resulted in the band's signing to Equal Vision. During that time they also released a split 7" [...] with Fastbreak. The first result of the partnership was a compiling of the demo and Hardcore Pride 7" [...] onto a single CD. <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight would next release an album entitled Back on Track. Lineup changes followed, as the group toured Europe and the United States through 1997 and 1998. In 1998, the band recorded six new songs that would later surface on The Only Way EP.|$|R
5000|$|Cave In {{was formed}} by Jay Frechette and Stephen Brodsky in early 1995. They named {{themselves}} Cave-In as a homage to the Codeine song, Cave-In, from the album Frigid Stars. The initial line-up consisted of Frechette on vocals, Brodsky on guitar and vocals, Adam McGrath on second guitar, JR Conners on drums and Justin Matthes on bass. They would soon release a demo {{and a handful of}} split 7" [...] releases with bands such as Gambit, Piebald and Early Grace, and see Matthes briefly replaced by Andy Kyte. 1997 saw Cave In's first release; a self-titled 7" [...] on Aaron Turner's Hydra Head Records. Following that release, the band embarked on a three-week East Coast tour. That tour was, however, cut a week short due to Jay Frechette's prior obligations to join and tour with Boston-based <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight. After Frechette returned from a month on tour with <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight it was a mutual decision for him to leave Cave In and to join <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight full-time. At this point, Dave Scrod stepped in for a short-lived tenure as interim vocalist. In 1998, most tracks from previous 7" [...] releases and recordings were compiled to form Beyond Hypothermia.|$|R
5|$|Stuart scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} 2008–09 season in the 2–1 home defeat to Stevenage Borough on 25 September. Stevenage's goalkeeper, Chris Day, parried a header from Barry Cogan which dropped at Stuart's feet who hit a low hard shot from <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> out. Grays faced League One outfit Carlisle United away in the FA Cup first round on 8 November. In the 1–1 stalemate, Stuart scored Grays' only goal in the 52nd minute, with a ten-yard volley. In the New Year's Day fixture of 2009, Stuart scored with a header from a free-kick taken by Sam Sloma, to hand Grays a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following the {{departure}} of manager Wayne Burnett, Stuart took the role of assistant manager at Grays, alongside Stuart Elliott in late January 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. If they fail to advance <b>ten</b> <b>yards,</b> possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|E
5|$|Boston College won the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss to determine first possession and elected {{to kick off}} to begin the game, ensuring that the Eagles would receive the ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech kick returner Dyrell Roberts fielded the ball at the Tech six-yard line and returned it to the Tech 33-yard line before the first play of the game, a four-yard pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor to wide receiver Danny Coale. Despite that initial gain, the Hokies were unable to advance the ball further and punted after going three and out. Boston College's Rich Gunnell fair caught the kick at the Eagles' 16-yard line, where the Boston College offense ran its first play of the game. Running back Montel Harris ran for a one-yard gain, but Boston College was unable to gain the needed <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> for a first down, just as Virginia Tech had failed {{to do in the}} prior series. After going three and out, the Eagles punted back to Virginia Tech and the Hokies' offense returned to the field at the Tech 39-yard line with 11:30 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

The unit advanced to the Yale <b>ten</b> <b>yard</b> line {{in the last few}} minutes of the fourth quarter but missed anticlimactically a 32-yard field goal attempt moments before game time expired.|$|R
5|$|Chicago hosted Arizona in week two, the 92nd meeting all-time; the Bears, who {{possessed a}} 58–27–6 record against the Cardinals {{entering}} the game, won {{the most recent}} meeting in 2012 28–13, though Arizona won the last game at Soldier Field in 2009 41–21. The Bears faced a 3–4 defense {{for the second consecutive}} week, and the Cardinals had a blitz-heavy defense. To attack it, Jeff Joniak wrote Matt Forte would have to be utilized. When passing, the Bears had to be wary of left-side cornerback Patrick Peterson; in 2014, Arizona's opponents only threw passes of at least <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> to that side 29 times, the fifth-lowest in the NFL. As a result, teams attempted to throw ti the right, with 51 deep passes, though only 29.4 percent were completed, the sixth-lowest in the league. Defensively, the Bears had to provide pressure to Carson Palmer, who had excelled in the season opener against the Saints with a three-touchdown game, against a line that allowed no sacks in week one, while also focusing on challenging the speed of the Arizona receivers. lineman Ego Ferguson, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, Jon Bostic, Tayo Fabuluje were inactive for the game.|$|E
5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were {{incrementally}} {{introduced into the}} game, including {{the adoption of the}} line of scrimmage, scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the best all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|E
50|$|Loose man {{requires}} cornerbacks to {{play off}} the receiver with a five to <b>ten</b> <b>yard</b> cushion. He usually does {{not touch the}} receiver and tries to keep his head on a swivel {{in order to move}} in whatever direction the receiver decides to shape his route. Typically with loose man coverage, the cornerback has little or no help from the safety in defending against the receiver.|$|R
50|$|Youth crew bands first {{achieved}} visibility {{in popular}} culture through CIV (featuring the former singer of Gorilla Biscuits). Later youth crew-derived music became increasingly associated with metalcore, particularly {{in the cases of}} Earth Crisis and Strife. The late 1990s saw a revival of the youth crew style, revisited by bands such as In My Eyes, Bane, <b>Ten</b> <b>Yard</b> Fight, and Better Than a Thousand.|$|R
5|$|In 1834, Weston {{established}} a large shipyard on the Bluefish River in Duxbury {{known as the}} <b>Ten</b> Acre <b>Yard.</b> The largest vessels of the Weston fleet were built there, and it had the capacity for the simultaneous construction of two vessels. When Samuel Hall left Weston's employment, a local master carpenter named Samuel Cushing took over as superintendent of the <b>Ten</b> Acre <b>Yard</b> and built vessels there until the yard ceased operation in 1843.|$|R
5|$|Tech's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Eagles' 30-yard line. Davis started the drive with an incomplete pass, then Harris gained seven yards with a rush up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and Boston College punted. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 30-yard line, and with 5:01 left in the quarter, the Hokies returned to offense. On the first play, Taylor ran 11 yards for a first down. Taylor threw an incomplete pass, and the Hokies were penalized 10 yards for holding, pushing {{them back to the}} 31-yard line. Tech was unable to regain the lost yardage, and punted. The kick was 57 yards, and Boston College was further backed up by a penalty during the return. Following the kick, Boston College's offense was forced back to its seven-yard line to start. An incomplete pass was followed by a scramble by Davis. During the run, Davis fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Boston College player. Facing third down, Davis scrambled again, this time for a first down to the 21-yard line. On the first play after the first down scramble, a deep pass downfield by Davis was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Stephan Virgil. The interception {{was returned}} to the Boston College 10-yard line, and on the first play by Tech's offense, Evans ran the <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:17 remaining, the Hokies extended their lead to 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} season, the Bears visited Kansas City, who trailed the Bears 5–6 in the all-time series; the game {{was the first in}} Kansas City since 2003, which the Chiefs won 31–3. Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be {{cautious}} of Bob Sutton's 3–4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive.|$|E

25|$|If the offence {{fails to}} make <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> in three plays, the defence takes over on downs.|$|E
25|$|Each play {{constitutes}} a down. The offence must advance {{the ball at}} least <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> have been gained the offence gains {{a new set of}} three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain <b>ten</b> <b>yards</b> in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down or try to kick a field goal (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.|$|E
