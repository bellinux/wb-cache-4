5|$|Falk was {{frequently}} blasted for {{making use of}} threats and side-deals <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> clients around and maximize their earnings, but he remained unapologetic, arguing that he was simply looking after {{the best interests of}} his clients.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Gygax {{got a job}} as an {{insurance}} underwriter at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. His family continued to grow, and after his third child was born, he decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> family back to Lake Geneva. Except for a few months he would spend in Clinton, Wisconsin, following his divorce, and his time in Hollywood while he was the head of TSR's entertainment division, Lake Geneva would be his home {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|Stark began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> {{force to}} Hog Island at about 10 am and {{directed}} {{most of his}} men to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle's Island {{with a group of}} thirty men.

5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Washington's death, a Congressional {{committee}} recommended {{a different type}} of monument. John Marshall, a Representative from Virginia (who later became Chief Justice of the United States) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol. However, a lack of funds, disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country's first president, and the Washington family's reluctance <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> body prevented progress on any project.|$|E
5|$|The 19th Division {{was forced}} to retreat towards Kefri Kasim and the XXII Corps (Eighth Army), {{threatened}} with encirclement, was in retreat towards Et Tire having lost most of its artillery.

5|$|The United States {{declared}} war on Britain on 18 June 1812. Despite his preparations, Brock was worried about Canadian security. In Upper Canada, besides the militia, {{there was only one}} British regular infantry regiment, a detachment of retired veterans, and a company of artillery. These had to be dispersed among several widely separated posts. Brock's advantage was that the armed vessels of the Provincial Marine controlled the lakes, and allowed him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> reserves rapidly between threatened points.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} impelled the Krugers' {{return to}} the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that compelled Mzilikazi <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father thereupon settled {{at the foot of}} the Magaliesberg mountains in the Transvaal. In Natal Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as Dingaansdag ("Dingane's Day") or the Day of the Vow.|$|E
5|$|After Groza retired, he entertained {{an offer}} {{to play for the}} San Francisco 49ers, but was {{reluctant}} to do so because he did not want <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> family and insurance business to the West Coast. He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach, helping mentor the young Don Cockroft, but he declined. Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments. He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea, Ohio near the Browns' headquarters and training facility. He and his wife Jackie were known as the team's First Family.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{accompanied}} the First Corps to northern Georgia {{in the fall}} of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga. He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle, but served as Longstreet's chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864. He returned with the corps to Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war, now with the rank of brigadier general (as of February 26, 1864). He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign, and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee's army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg, Alexander was able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> guns quickly through the lines, emplacing them to repel the main attack.|$|E
5|$|By July 1944, Germany {{was losing}} the war; the SS began closing down the easternmost {{concentration}} camps and deporting the remaining prisoners westward. Many {{were killed in}} Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Schindler convinced SS-Hauptsturmführer Amon Göth, commandant of the nearby Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, to allow him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> factory to Brünnlitz in the Sudetenland, thus sparing his workers from almost certain death in the gas chambers. Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg, Göth's secretary Mietek Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1,200 Jews who travelled to Brünnlitz in October 1944. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the execution of his workers {{until the end of}} World War II in Europe in May 1945, by which time he had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black market purchases of supplies for his workers.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{and some}} members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM {{headquarters}} arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and {{it was decided to}} abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> headquarters.|$|E
50|$|Kühnemann's intense {{interest}} in family photographs spurred in him curiosity regarding {{his family and}} cultural roots, and alongside his attempt to push his artistic and professional limits, this lead him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother's hometown, Berlin.|$|R

5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E
5|$|For the French, {{despite their}} success earlier at Frauenfeld, {{the action was}} {{considerably}} less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded that he took immediate leave, and remained out of action and command until 22 July. The conduct of the battle also demonstrated {{the weakness of the}} French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> division to Ney's flanks.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness Thomas's {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>his</b> family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy at Los Alamos would be led by the youthful Joseph W. Kennedy.|$|E
