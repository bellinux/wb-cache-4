5|$|Black {{struggles to}} find {{anything}} useful while investigating the abduction. However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife away from him and stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the young mother of carelessness and began <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the young mother decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in January 1971 {{scientists}} {{conducted a}} series of neurolinguistic tests on Genie to determine and monitor the course and extent of her mental development, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed study of her brain. Genie's entire brain was physically intact and Shurley's sleep-studies found sleep patterns typical of a left-hemisphere dominant person, leading scientists <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> was most likely right-handed. Over the following years multiple tests of her handedness bolstered this conclusion, as did observations of her in everyday situations. Based on their early tests, doctors suspected Genie's brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant.|$|E

She was later temporarily rendered comatose by Mastermind.|$|E

500|$|Hoshino {{has been}} highly praised for her art, {{which has been}} {{compared}} to the works of Joe Madureira, Kelley Jones, and Chris Bachalo by one reviewer and described as [...] "some of the best artwork in the business" [...] by another.

500|$|Although the Duchess of Marlborough’s {{downfall}} is chiefly {{attributed to}} her selfish and self-serving relationship with Queen Anne, {{she was a}} vibrant and intelligent woman, who loyally promoted Anne's interests when she was princess.

She seems to have underestimated Anne's strength of character, continuing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> could dominate a woman whom foreign Ambassadors noted had become [...] "very determined and quite ferocious". Apart from her notorious bad temper, Sarah's main weakness has been described as [...] "an almost pathological inability to admit the validity of anyone else's point of view".|$|E

Dr. Robert Sauer, the veterinarian, stated that the survival of the dog for several days was consistent with the stamina of such an animal. On March 4, the dog was euthanized in order to allow veterinarians from the University of Pennsylvania to examine its stomach contents, and establish why the dog outlived Barker. Investigators wanted to know if the dog was without food or water since Barker's disappearance.|$|E

When Adam's crimes were revealed and Faith was returned to Sharon, she remained in love with him; SoapNet considered the relationship [...] "dark". Since 2011, former showrunner Maria Arena Bell and subsequent head writers that followed have significantly changed the character's direction, receiving negative backlash from critics and audiences. Sharon married her ex-father-in-law Victor Newman, gained control of his company (Newman Enterprises) and burned down his ranch—a sequence of events which resulted in her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The character was then involved in a DNA test alteration storyline, which was also heavily criticized by critics.|$|E
