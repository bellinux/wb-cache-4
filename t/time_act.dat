5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's powers to the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} extension of time and for powers to compulsorily purchase land for an electrical sub-station at Lambeth. The merger was rejected by Parliament, but the land purchase and extension of time were permitted separately in the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1903 and the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Extension of <b>Time)</b> <b>Act,</b> 1903, both given royal assent on 11 August 1903.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, {{when the}} Uniform <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> came into effect, the Upper Peninsula went under year-round CST, with no {{daylight}} saving time. In 1973, {{the majority of}} the peninsula switched to Eastern Time; only the four western border counties of Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee continue to observe Central Time. Daylight savings time is observed peninsula wide.|$|E
25|$|The first {{international}} victory for an ACT representative side was in 1973, when they defeated Tonga 17 points to six. In 1978 an ACT side defeated Wales, who were Five Nations champions at the <b>time.</b> <b>ACT</b> had trailed at half time, 6 to 16, but {{came back and}} won with a penalty kick in the final moments of the match.|$|E
50|$|Later in {{the book}} of Acts, both when Samaritans joined the church for the first <b>time</b> (<b>Acts</b> 8:12ff), and when Gentiles joined the Church for the first <b>time</b> (<b>Acts</b> 10:44ff), baptism {{followed}} immediately and was even commanded in Acts 10. Whether or not these examples of baptism that are found in the New Testament proves that children are categorically ineligible for baptism is disputed.|$|R

25|$|ACT Theatre (originally A Contemporary Theatre) is a regional, {{non-profit}} theatre {{organization in}} Seattle, Washington, USA. Gregory A. Falls (1922–1997) founded ACT in 1965 {{and served as}} its first Artistic director; at the <b>time</b> <b>ACT</b> was founded he was also head of the Drama Department at the University of Washington. Falls was identified with the theatrical avant garde of the time, and founded ACT because he saw the Seattle Repertory Theatre as too specifically devoted to classics.|$|E
25|$|The bill amends the Uniform <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> of 1966 by {{changing}} the start and end dates of daylight saving time, beginning in 2007. Clocks were set ahead one hour on the second Sunday of March (March 11, 2007) {{instead of on the}} first Sunday of April (April 1, 2007). Clocks were set back one hour on the first Sunday in November (November 4, 2007), rather than on the last Sunday of October (October 28, 2007). This had the net effect of slightly lengthening the duration of daylight savings time.|$|E
25|$|Counties and parishes {{are also}} still {{referenced}} in property law, and in industrial relations instruments, {{for example in}} a New South Wales award, which excludes people from the County of Yancowinna. Similar award examples exist in the other states and territories that have been subdivided into counties. The County of Yancowinna is also {{the only part of}} New South Wales which is in a different time zone {{to the rest of the}} state, as mentioned in the Australian Standard <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> of 1987. Counties are also used on paperwork for mortgage securities in banks. Parishes and counties are also mentioned in definitions of electoral districts.|$|E

25|$|An {{extension}} at {{the southern}} end of the line to Camberwell and Denmark Hill was proposed and approved in 1931 as part of the London Electric Metropolitan District and Central London Railway Companies (Works) Act, 1931. In April 1937, the estimated cost of the proposed extension was £5,000,000 (approximately £ today) and the London Passenger Transport Board announced that, due to rising materials prices, the extension had been postponed until the Board's finances improved. Apart from the extension of the sidings south of Elephant & Castle, no work on the extension took place before the Second World War, but the powers were renewed by the government in 1947 under the Special Enactments (Extension of <b>Time)</b> <b>Act,</b> 1940. A projected extension as far as Camberwell was shown on a 1949 edition of the Underground map but no further work was done. The train describers at Warwick Avenue station showed Camberwell as a destination until the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing the}} news of war between the British Empire and Turkey, Dinar became more defiant and in April 1915 renounced his {{allegiance}} to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan Government, declaring himself pro-Turkish and making contact with them via the Senussi. At the time, Darfur had a population of just under 1,000,000 controlled by what {{was described as a}} [...] "slave army" [...] of about 10,000 men. By December, affairs had deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} a small unit from the Egyptian Camel Corps was dispatched to protect trade at Nahud, and at the same <b>time</b> <b>act</b> as a warning against Dinar's proposed offensive against the Rizeigat tribe. Dinar instead countered the deployment of the Camel Corps detachment by moving his own troops – forty cavalry and ninety infantry – to reinforce Jebel el Hella. However, by then the British believed he was preparing for an invasion of Sudan.|$|E

2500|$|Time zones {{were first}} {{adopted by the}} United States Congress with the Standard <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> of 1918. All of Indiana was located in the Central Time Zone. [...] It was at this time the {{dividing}} line between Eastern Time and Central Time was moved from the Pennsylvania-Ohio state line to the Indiana–Ohio state line. [...] Daylight saving time (DST) {{was included in the}} original Standard <b>Time</b> <b>Act.</b> A year later, Congress repealed daylight saving time from the Standard <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> of 1918, though some communities continued to follow it. During World War II, daylight saving time was once again mandated by Congress to conserve energy. After the war, the mandate to observe daylight saving time was lifted again.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961, the Indiana {{legislature}} repealed the 1957 law making Central Time {{the official}} time of Indiana, which allowed any community to observe DST. The Interstate Commerce Commission divided Indiana between the Central Time Zone and the Eastern Time Zone. Still, neither the time zone line nor {{daylight saving time}} were uniformly observed (see [...] ). The United States Congress later passed the Uniform <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> of 1966 ( [...] April 13, 1966; [...] ) to specify where and when daylight saving time was applied in the U.S., and authority was shifted to the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT). Prior to the passing of this law, each state was permitted to decide this issue for itself. Having the state split in two time zones was inconvenient, however, so Governor Roger D. Branigin petitioned the USDOT to place all of Indiana back in the Central Time Zone a year later.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the Indiana General Assembly overrode a veto from Governor Whitcomb {{to place}} the Northwest and Southwest corners of Indiana in the Central Time Zone on {{daylight}} saving time, and {{to place the}} rest of the state on Eastern Standard Time, upon federal approval (see [...] ). Congress approved an amendment ( [...] ;) to the Uniform <b>Time</b> <b>Act</b> of 1966 to permit a state that lay in two time zones to exempt part of the state from daylight saving time, and President Richard Nixon signed it into law. Indiana enacted the statute, officially placing northwest and southwest Indiana in the Central Time Zone, in observance of daylight saving time, and {{the rest of the}} state in the Eastern Standard Time throughout the year. Several eastern Indiana counties (Ohio and Dearborn counties, near Cincinnati; and Floyd, Clark, and Harrison counties, near Louisville) chose to unofficially observe daylight saving time, despite the Indiana statute.|$|E
60|$|The {{governor}} {{and his son}} then left for the city, and the forest men retired to what was now their country. Ned and Gerald impressed upon their allies the importance of observing, strictly, the conditions of peace; {{and at the same}} time of continuing their exercises in arms, and maintaining their discipline. They pointed out to them that a treaty of this kind, extorted as it were from one, and that the strongest of the contracting powers, was certain not to have long duration. The Spaniards would smart at the humiliation which had, in their opinion, befallen them; and although the fugitive clause might for some <b>time</b> <b>act</b> favorably, it was sure, sooner or later, to be a bone of contention. They impressed upon them also that although they might, as had been shown, achieve successes for a time, yet that in the long run the power of the Spaniards must prevail, and that nothing short of extermination awaited them; therefore he urged the strictest adherence to the treaty, {{and at the same time}} a preparedness for the recommencement of hostilities.|$|E
