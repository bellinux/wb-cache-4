The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back and bottom of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen.

5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex at the center of <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{associated}} many gods {{who took}} felid form with the sun, and many lioness deities, like Sekhmet, Menhit, and Tefnut, were equated with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Bastet was depicted {{as both a}} domestic cat and a lioness, and with these two forms she could represent both the peaceful and violent aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Yet another goddess of the solar Eye was Mut, the consort of the god Amun, who was associated with Ra. Mut was first called <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Ra in the late New Kingdom, and the aspects of her character that were related to <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> grew increasingly prominent over time. Mut, too, could appear in both leonine and cat form.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> of Ra or Eye of Re is a {{being in}} ancient Egyptian mythology that {{functions}} as a feminine counterpart to the sun god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> {{is an extension of}} Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by a wide variety of Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner in the creative cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> of Ra is similar to <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> of Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology.|$|E

5|$|A myth about <b>the</b> <b>Eye,</b> {{known from}} allusions in the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) {{and a more}} {{complete}} account in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus from the Late Period (664–332 BC), demonstrates the Eye's close connection with Ra and Atum and her ability to act independently. The myth takes place before {{the creation of the}} world, when the solar creator—either Ra or Atum—is alone. Shu and Tefnut, the children of this creator god, have drifted away from him in the waters of Nu, the chaos that exists before creation in Egyptian belief, so he sends out his Eye to find them. <b>The</b> <b>Eye</b> returns with Shu and Tefnut but is infuriated to see that the creator has developed a new eye, which has taken her place. The creator god appeases her by giving her an exalted position on his forehead {{in the form of the}} uraeus, the emblematic cobra that appears frequently in Egyptian art, particularly on royal crowns. The equation of <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> with the uraeus and the crown underlines the Eye's role as a companion to Ra and to the pharaoh, with whom Ra is linked. Upon the return of Shu and Tefnut, the creator god is said to have shed tears, although whether they are prompted by happiness at his children's return or distress at the Eye's anger is unclear. These tears give rise to the first humans. In a variant of the story, it is <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> that weeps instead, so <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> is the progenitor of humankind.|$|E
5|$|After {{its first}} peak in intensity, Nangka {{slightly}} weakened as convection {{along the west}} side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell, and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> became cloud-filled. Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume, and the structure became more symmetric late on July8 as it moved toward the Northern Marianas Islands. A well-defined inner eye re-developed inside of an outer eyewall. On July9, the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a super typhoon, estimating peak 1minute winds of 250km/h (155mph). The JMA also assessed a 10minute peak of 185km/h (115mph). At 06:00UTC on July9, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> became cloud-filled and was no longer visible by July11, although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south. However, the convection reorganized the next day and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> reformed. By that time, Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 36hours, Francisco began weakening, after <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> lost definition due to building wind shear. By October21, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> became ragged and cloud-filled while the overall satellite {{presentation of the}} storm became elongated. That day, the typhoon entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which gave Francisco the local name Urduja; the agency would cease issuing advisories on October23. Conditions generally remained favorable, allowing <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> to remain distinct despite a great reduction in the sustained winds. Dry air began affecting the tropical cyclone late on October22, cutting off the flow of moist air, and water temperatures cooled along the storm's track. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> dissipated and the convection weakened. An approaching trough from the Korean peninsula weakened the ridge to the north, slowing the typhoon and allowing it to turn north and northeast on October24. Francisco weakened below typhoon status after passing 210km (130mi) southeast of Okinawa. The storm began interacting with the approaching cold front while it passed south of Japan, moving around the subtropical ridge. With increasing wind shear, the circulation became exposed from the convection, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on October25, declaring that Francisco was becoming extratropical. On the next day, Francisco completed its extratropical transition, but dissipated later on October26, to the southeast of Japan.|$|E
