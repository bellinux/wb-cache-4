5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools <b>to</b> <b>help</b> his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties <b>to</b> <b>help</b> pass legislation used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E

50|$|Two studies {{comparing}} reciprocal concessions {{with social}} responsibility explanations found evidence for social responsibility related <b>to</b> <b>helping.</b> In the first study, participants read DITF scenarios and then rated whether certain terms were relevant to these situations or not. These terms either referred <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> or <b>to</b> bargaining. In the second study, participants rated {{the similarity of}} a DITF interaction to four other situations: helping a friend, negotiating with a friend, helping a stranger, and negotiating with a stranger. The DITF scenarios used in both studies were taken from previous research and shown to be very effective in influencing compliance. Overall, findings indicate that participants felt DITF interactions were more closely related <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> than bargaining. This supports the social responsibility explanation of the DITF technique because social responsibility is related <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> one's self, while reciprocal concessions is related to negotiating.|$|R
