Another poll taken by Instituto Opina a day before <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> placed support of the same-sex marriage bill at 62.1% and support of adoption by same-sex couples at 49.1%. An Instituto Opina poll taken nine months after <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> said 61% agreed with the Government's decision.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, {{authorization}} for {{a national}} historical park designation was incorporated in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.

5|$|In November 1912 a {{bill was}} {{published}} {{that included a}} plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913, although the advent of World War I prevented work on the extension.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 2014, Maloney {{introduced}} the Human Trafficking Prevention Act (H.R. 4449; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would require regular training and briefings for some federal government personnel to raise awareness of human trafficking and help employees spot cases of it. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> in the House on July 23, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau agent {{wrote to}} Congressman William Kelley of Pennsylvania {{requesting}} {{the removal of}} Johnston's disabilities because of his charity.

5|$|A {{commission}} {{run by the}} Federal Council of Churches in America sought {{issuance of}} a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions {{under the supervision of}} Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.|$|E
5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} {{legislature}} {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed,</b> but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Mayor Cheye Calvo {{proposed}} {{a measure that}} would require every Maryland police department that operates a SWAT team to submit biannual reports on its activities, including where {{and when it was}} deployed and whether an operation resulted in arrests, evidence seizures, or injuries. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> that same year, despite strong opposition from Maryland's police agencies. Maryland was the first state to adopt such legislation; Utah became the second when it passed a similar bill in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|In February, Rivers {{submitted}} {{a bill to}} provide more funding for food banks and other charitable causes. The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor. It also made the donations received by utilities separate from gross income, allowing {{for it to be}} tax-free. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed {{to make it to the}} Senate floor.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Reed {{introduced}} a bill to authorize scholastic teaching of the textbook The Bible and Its Influence by the non-partisan, ecumenical Bible Literacy Project. The bible curriculum bill, which came {{a few years after}} Democrats opposed Republican attempts to promote teaching a translation of the scriptures, was an attempt to preempt a Republican attempt to display the Ten Commandments in schools. Faith is an area where Georgia Democrats differ from the national party. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> in the State Senate by a 50–1 margin on February 3, and it eventually became law.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> never <b>passed.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> thus <b>passed</b> to <b>the</b> Senate, {{where it}} was {{referred}} to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator Robert F. Wagner issued a report, recommending that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>pass</b> unamended. When <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's Jesse H. Metcalf moved to amend it so that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> would also provide for the issuance of a Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> as a while, and it passed the Senate.|$|R
50|$|In {{bicameral}} legislatures, if <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passes</b> <b>the</b> third reading, it is {{then sent}} to the other chamber of parliament to start the process again at first reading in that chamber. Once <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> has <b>passed</b> third reading in both chambers, it is sent on for promulgation, such as Royal Assent in the Westminster system or signing by the president or governor in the U.S. model. In a unicameral legislature, after passing third reading in the sole chamber, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> goes on directly for promulgation.|$|R
5|$|In March 1898, a {{resolution}} {{was introduced in}} Congress for a commission to erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party split on the issue. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed,</b> Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber took {{personal}} {{charge of}} the project, seeking to avoid the delays and disputes that had marked the two previous commemoratives, the Columbian half dollar and the Isabella quarter. On March 24, 1899, Mint Director George E. Roberts {{wrote in a letter}} that the Lafayette Memorial Commission was contemplating having, {{on one side of the}} coin, a representation of the new monument. Barber responded the following day to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Henry Boyer, referencing that letter and asking for a sketch of the monument.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of an}} {{election}} pledge, the Victorian state government made good on their promise to give Geelong residents the ability to directly elect their next mayor, with <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passing</b> through <b>the</b> Victorian upper-house on 9 February 2012.|$|R
25|$|An {{identical}} bill, H. R. 15767, {{had been}} introduced in the House of Representatives on January 17, 1921. On February 10, 1921, Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures (to which <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> had been referred) reported {{it back to the}} House with an amendment identical to that approved by the Senate, and with a recommendation that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>pass.</b> S. 4983 had been referred to that committee after its receipt by the House, and on February 24, the Coinage Committee recommended <b>the</b> Senate <b>bill</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> House, noting that <b>the</b> two <b>bills</b> were identical.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{deregulation}} <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> anyway, although President Eisenhower vetoed it on February 17.|$|R
5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring that judges consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{versions}} the {{two houses}} had passed were not identical, the bill {{returned to the}} House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment. The Speaker, Champ Clark, felt that {{the title of the}} bill might have to be changed for reasons he did not explain, but Hayden disagreed and Clark did not press his point. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> the House, and was enacted by the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, {{designed to make}} it easier for the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in expropriating at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>passed</b> the legislature in late April.|$|E
500|$|Hearings on the president's proposal, {{introduced}} as H.R. 8926, began before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 4. Chairman Wright Patman, <b>the</b> <b>bill's</b> sponsor, deemed {{it to have}} something for everyone, including price supports for silver, though industrial users would benefit most, as the silver formerly used in coinage would be freed up for commercial use. Most business stakeholders, including the banks, the vending machine operators, and corporate leaders, wanted to see <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>pass,</b> it being better than the current situation. [...] On June 11, the committee issued a report recommending <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>pass,</b> with amendments requiring the half dollar {{to be made of}} base metal, requiring the silver coins that would be struck during the transition period to be dated 1964, and banning the striking of silver dollars for five years.|$|R
