5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

At {{the time she}} referred to herself: [...] "I am a strong Ukrainian girl, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> work a lot". However, later, in an interview for the Ukrainian version of the Vogue magazine, Milla stated she doesn't actually consider herself Ukrainian. Expressing her disagreement with several newspapers that presented Jovovich as a [...] "Ukrainian actress", her mother Galina said, [...] "They may say whatever they want. My parents are Russian, from Tula. Milla is half Russian, half Montenegrin. But, I think, she considers herself of Russian descent".|$|E
500|$|Stuart Jones of The Times {{concluded}} in his match report that The Football Association (FA) were given no choice, [...] "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute." [...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years is too often. The name of Arsenal has been sullied and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have taken this action." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and get it away from me. And <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E

500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> am always on about peace." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{warfare and}} the inner value of the Russian opponent, the dull mass had two kinds of [...] "ideas": the tsar and God. Today, there is neither. Bolshevism has taken their place.

2500|$|Tolkien {{included}} neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work. Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of The Lord of the Rings {{reflect his}} Catholic worldview. In {{one of his}} letters Tolkien states, [...] "The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world.

2500|$|The dispute {{came to a}} head at the AFL's {{convention}} in Atlantic City in 1935, when William Hutcheson, the President of the United Carpenters, made a slighting comment about a rubber worker who was delivering an organizing report. Lewis responded that Hutcheson's comment was [...] "small potatoes," [...] and Hutcheson replied, [...] "I was raised on small potatoes, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> am so small." [...] After some more words, Lewis punched Hutcheson, knocking him to the ground. Lewis then relit his cigar and returned to the rostrum. The incident, which was also [...] "small potatoes" [...] but very memorable, helped cement Lewis's image in the public eye as someone willing to fight for workers' right to organize.|$|E
