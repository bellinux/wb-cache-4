5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it.

When he left it in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour.

All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E

5|$|Warkworth Castle is an {{irregular}} enclosure. The keep {{is at the}} north end, overlooking the town, with the bailey to the south. The current keep was built on an earlier mound, known as a motte. The curtain wall of the bailey dates from the early 13thcentury. There are four towers: Carrickfergus Tower in the south-west corner, Montagu Tower in the south-east, a postern tower in the west wall (north of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen),</b> and Grey Mare's Tail Tower attached to the east wall. Against the east curtain wall was a stable. In the northern half of the bailey, aligned east–west, was an unfinished 15th-century collegiate church; it was cleared away in the early 16thcentury. Immediately west of the church was <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> situated in {{the angle of the}} curtain wall as it changes from its north–south alignment and turns towards the keep. Along the west curtain wall, south of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> were the pantry, great hall, and withdrawing chambers. In the south-west was a chapel.
