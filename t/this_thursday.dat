60|$|The {{next morning}} a signal silence prevailed {{throughout}} the city, where not a wheel stirred or {{the sound of}} a hoof broke the hush of the streets. We had noted already that there were seven Sundays every week in Rome, as was fit in the capital of the Christian religion, but <b>this</b> <b>Thursday</b> was of an intenser Sabbath stillness than any first day of the week that we had yet known. There was the clack of passing feet in the street under our windows, but we looked out upon a yawning void where the busy cabs had clustered, and the cabmen had socially chaffed and quarrelled, and entreated the stranger in the cabman's superstition that a stranger never knows when he wants a cab. Now he could have walked all over Rome without being once invited to drive. Except for here and there a private carriage, or the coupe evidently of a doctor, the streets were empty, and the tourists had to join the citizens in their pedestrian exercise.|$|E
6000|$|IT {{happened}} that Mrs. Pomfret {{had had a}} slight quarrel with Mrs. Best, the housekeeper, on <b>this</b> <b>Thursday</b> morning--a fact which had two consequences highly convenient to Hetty. It caused Mrs. Pomfret to have tea sent up to her own room, and it inspired that exemplary lady's maid with so lively a recollection of former passages in Mrs. Best's conduct, and of dialogues in which Mrs. Best had decidedly the inferiority as an interlocutor with Mrs. Pomfret, that Hetty required no more presence of mind than was demanded for using her needle, and throwing in an occasional [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no." [...] She {{would have wanted to}} put on her hat earlier than usual; only she had told Captain Donnithorne that she usually set out about eight o'clock, and if he SHOULD go to the Grove again expecting to see her, and she should be gone! Would he come? Her little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory and dubious expectation. At last the minute-hand of the old-fashioned brazen-faced timepiece was on the last quarter to eight, and there was every reason for its being time to get ready for departure. Even Mrs. Pomfret's preoccupied mind did not prevent her from noticing what looked like a new flush of beauty in the little thing as she tied on her hat before the looking-glass.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the line}} between {{literature}} and reality becomes increasingly thin, allowing characters in the books and those in 'real life' to jump {{in and out of}} novels. <b>This</b> leads <b>Thursday</b> to change the ending of Jane Eyre, the joke being that the plot we know in our reality is the far superior change caused by <b>Thursday.</b> <b>This</b> also happens to other classic novels: Uriah Heep becomes the obsequious, and generally insincere character we know, due to an accident inside the book world, and Thursday's uncle Mycroft becomes Sherlock Holmes's brother.|$|R
