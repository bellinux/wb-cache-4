40|$|Abstract: Input-output models, {{when applied}} correctly, can be {{powerful}} tools for estimating the economy-wide {{effects of an}} initial change in economic activity. To effectively use these models, analysts must collect detailed information about the project or program under <b>study.</b> <b>Analysts</b> {{also need to be}} aware of the assumptions and limitations of these models. In this paper, we will focus on these assumptions and on the information that is required to use regional input-output multipliers correctly. We focus specifically on multipliers generated by the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. 1...|$|R

The method is concise, has intuitive appeal, has minimal data requirements, and is accurate when benchmarked against two existing case <b>studies.</b> <b>Analysts</b> who want to screen distributed resource investment opportunities with a minimal amount of effort will find the method particularly useful. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the Study/Objective: The {{purpose is}} to study goals and {{measurement}} of Investor Relations (IR) communication {{from the perspectives of}} Investor Relations Officers (IROs) and sell-side analysts. In addition, this study aims to provide both academic and practical suggestions on how to develop IR communication goal setting and measurement further. Data and methods: The research data is collected through semi-structured interviews with IROs and sell- side analysts. The analysis of the data focuses on finding similarities and differences both with existing literature and what the IROs and analysts consider as relevant goals and measures for IR communication. Findings and conclusions: The most important goals for IR are ensuring effective disclosure, enabling two-way communication and coordinating IR and PR messages.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{improvement of}} the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of the autoclave process through the implementation of <b>time</b> <b>studies.</b> Two types of <b>time</b> <b>study</b> are employed where the initial <b>time</b> <b>study</b> conducted was the direct stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> used to validate the current OEE standard. Maynard's Operation Sequencing Technique (MOST) is then adopted to conduct the secondary <b>time</b> <b>study.</b> MOST study revealed the significant value added and non-value added activities at each sub process.

The paper significantly highlight problem in computing the OEE which is the inaccuracy of the data used and lack of a medium to evaluate the improvement ideas before it is implemented. MOST is an effective method to evaluate and shows the gain from the improvement ideas proposed without investing in costly implementations. The limitation of this study is mainly concerned with direct stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> performed during initial stage as it might varies from one person to another.

The <b>time</b> <b>study</b> techniques is applied under certain situation and the stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> is the best technique for manual production because human performance is not consistent from time to time. The stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study</b> had been selected for the study because 70 percents of the production in ABC bearings Limited is handled manually by man power. Overall equipment effectiveness is also calculated to measure performance in one shift. The objective is to determine optimal levels of time and defect rate reductions along with the corresponding optimal levels of investments respectively, and the optimal production cycle time for each product...|$|R

40|$|In many {{observational}} <b>studies,</b> <b>analysts</b> estimate treatment effects using propensity scores, e. g. {{by matching}} or sub-classifying on the scores. When some {{values of the}} covariates are missing, analysts can use multiple imputation {{to fill in the}} missing data, estimate propensity scores based on the m completed datasets, and use the propensity scores to estimate treatment effects. We compare two approaches to implement this process. In the first, the analyst estimates the treatment effect using propensity score matching within each completed data set, and averages the m treatment effect estimates. In the second approach, the analyst averages the m propensity scores for each record across the completed datasets, and performs propensity score matching with these averaged scores to estimate the treatment effect. We compare properties of both methods via simulation studies using artificial and real data. The simulations suggest that the second method has greater potential to produce substantial bias reductions than the first, particularly when the missing values are predictive of treatment assignment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{authors of}} books about prepositions {{note that the}} {{investigations}} of prepositions before 1980 s was relatively scarce. Cornelia Zelinsky-Wibbelt speaks about the preposition as “a lexical category which had long been neglected in linguistic inquiry” in the introduction of “The Semantics of Prepositions” (Zelinsky-Wibbelt 1). Expressed in the entry about adpositions in the Encyclopedia of Linguistics, D Kurzon’s opinion is that “the grammatical treatment of adpositions has undergone considerable change {{over the last three}} decades or so. In traditional approaches, the adposition was viewed merely as a minor word class consisting of a small set of words; it was very often treated briefly within a page or so” (Brown 63). Are prepositions merely connectors of other words? Are they connectors without meaning? In this introductory chapter, two of the most important distinctions will be addressed: the homonymy/polysemy and the closed-class—open-class. Before starting a <b>study,</b> <b>analysts</b> of prepositions need to decide about the above distinctions and these decisions will have a huge impact on the analysis [...] .

As legislative aide, she played a role in drafting the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. When Senator Buckley failed to win re-election in 1976, she became a member of the professional staff of the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, working for Senator Robert Stafford (R-Vermont) and the Republicans on the committee. During this period, she worked on the Clean Water Act of 1977.
