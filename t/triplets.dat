40|$|In this {{research}} intermolecular and intramolecular <b>triplet</b> sensitization has been employed to photochemically generate <b>triplet</b> alkyl nitrene intermediates in solution. Photolyzing with light greater than 300 nm assures {{that only the}} ketone chromophore is exclusively excited to its <b>triplet</b> excited state. Once generated, the ketone can transfer its <b>triplet</b> energy to the azide moiety which loses molecular nitrogen to give a <b>triplet</b> alkyl nitrene intermediate. Intermolecular <b>triplet</b> sensitization in solution allowed trapping of <b>triplet</b> alkyl nitrene intermediates via bimolecular reactions. Photolysis of 1 -azidoadamantane in solution with acetophenone, benzophenone and acetone led to an azo-dimer as the major product.

Intermolecular sensitized photolysis of benzyl azide led to N-methyleneaniline as the major photoproduct with acetophenone as the <b>triplet</b> sensitizer.

5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville <b>Triplets</b> of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the <b>Triplets</b> at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a sensitive spectroscopic method to probe <b>triplet</b> concentration in thin films of polyfluorene (PF) at room temperature. The energy of photoexcited <b>triplet</b> excitons {{is transferred to}} the guest metal–organic complex, meso-tetratolylporphyrin-Pd (PdTPP), and detected as phosphorescent emission. The phosphorescence intensity of PdTPP–PF blends {{is proportional to the}} independently measured <b>triplet</b> concentration using photoinduced absorption experiments. The high sensitivity of this method allows room temperature detection of <b>triplet</b> excitons in spin-coated polymer films as thin as 10 nm. We found that the <b>triplet</b> lifetime is independent of PdTPP concentration and therefore this method is nearly non-perturbing for the <b>triplet</b> population. ...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{constants}} for <b>triplet</b> {{energy transfer}} {{from a series}} of photosensitizers to the cis and trans isomers of stilbene and 1, 2 -diphenylpropene in benzene solution at room temperature have been measured by kinetic spectrophotometry. A plot of rate constants vs. <b>triplet</b> excitation energies of the sensitizers shows that there is a smooth transition from diffusion controlled to immeasurably small rates. Even when the <b>triplet</b> of the sensitizer is appreciably less energetic than the spectroscopic <b>triplet</b> of the acceptor, energy transfer takes place. In accord with previous work in these laboratories, this observation is interpreted in terms of non-vertical excitation in which the acceptor is excited to a <b>triplet</b> having lower energy and different geometry than the spectroscopic <b>triplet.</b> By contrast, dibenzcycloheptenol, selected as an isoenergetic and rigid model for cis-stilbene, accepts <b>triplet</b> energy less efficiently than cis-stilbene from a sensitizer having less than the spectroscopic <b>triplet</b> energy of these molecules. Evidence that 2, 4, 6 -triisopropyl- 4 '-methoxybenzophenone transfers <b>triplet</b> energy to cis- and trans-stilbene at a reduced rate because of steric hindrance indicates that factors other than the relative <b>triplet</b> energies of sensitizer and acceptor can be important in the process of energy transfer...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{the present}} study reports on the high {{efficiency}} blue PHOLEDs based on a carrier and <b>triplet</b> exciton confinement inside recombination zones by using a <b>triplet</b> multiple quantum structure. The <b>triplet</b> energies of mCP and TPBi are {{higher than those of}} FIrpic. Therefore, <b>triplet</b> multiple quantum structures with CCLs exhibited efficient carrier and <b>triplet</b> exciton confinement within each EML. Moreover, CCLs can play a role in carrier movement with ease and <b>triplet</b> exciton blocking as expected from high <b>triplet</b> energy levels. In the electrical characteristic results of blue devices, the properties of device C with three recombination zones were found to be superior to the properties of devices A, B, and D. We attribute such high efficiencies and reduced turn-on voltage to the following two advantages caused by the <b>triplet</b> MQW structure: (1) efficient charge and exciton confinement effect by CCLs and TEBLs with high <b>triplet</b> energy level and (2) charge transportation balance in each EML by CCLs with bipolar property. The described MQW device concept may be useful to fabricate highly efficient devices for future OLED display and lighting applications.|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of a novel polythiophene-based host-guest copolymer incorporating a Pt-porphyrin complex (TTP-Pt) into the backbone for efficient singlet to <b>triplet</b> polymer exciton sensitization. We elucidated the exciton dynamics in thin films of the material by means of Transient Absorption Spectrosopcy (TAS) on multiple timescales and investigated the mechanism of <b>triplet</b> exciton formation. During sensitization, single exciton diffusion is followed by exciton transfer from the polymer backbone to the complex where it undergoes intersystem crossing to the <b>triplet</b> state of the complex. We directly monitored the <b>triplet</b> exciton back transfer from the Pt-porphyrin to the polymer and find that 60 % of the complex <b>triplet</b> excitons are transferred with a time constant of 1087 ps. We propose an equilibrium between polymer and porphyrin <b>triplet</b> states {{as a result of}} the low <b>triplet</b> diffusion length in the polymer backbone and hence an increased local <b>triplet</b> population resulting in increased triplet-triplet annihilation.

40|$|Phosphorescence {{and delayed}} {{fluorescence}} of polyfluorene polymer films doped with cyclooctatetraene (COT) and anthracene are studied {{by means of}} time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The occurrence of an anomalous nonvertical <b>triplet</b> energy transfer in solid conjugated polymer films is demonstrated {{for the first time}} employing the "nonvertical" COT <b>triplet</b> acceptor, which appears to behave similarly to conventional vertical <b>triplet</b> acceptors, such as anthracene. Both dopant molecules are found to efficiently quench the host phosphorescence of the polymer without affecting the host fluorescence-this {{can be attributed to the}} large singlet-triplet (S- 1 -T- 1) splitting of these molecules. This S- 1 -T- 1 splitting is exceptionally large in COT due to its low-lying relaxed <b>triplet</b> state, which is capable of accepting host <b>triplet</b> excitations. In contrast to anthracene, the <b>triplet</b> lifetime of the COT molecules is reasonably short, thus making a fast deactivation of the <b>triplet</b> excitations possible.
