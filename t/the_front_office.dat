5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Hoffman {{returned to}} the Padres as a special assistant in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> In 2014, he became the team's pitching coordinator at their upper minor league levels, which included working with the Padres general manager. The following year, his role expanded to overseeing pitching instruction at all levels in the minors.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the start of the 2014–15 season, Sakic was given the title of general manager while Sherman was demoted to {{assistant}} general manager, thus formalizing the de facto arrangement that had been in place since 2013. Despite <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> changes, the Avalanche failed to qualify for the 2015 playoffs after finishing with a record of 39–31–12, resulting in a seventh-place finish in the Central Division.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as {{a player}} in 1985, Youngblood worked in the Rams' front office until 1991. He also worked in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> of the Sacramento Surge of the World League (WLAF) from 1992 to 1993, and {{the administration of the}} Canadian Football League's Sacramento Gold Miners from 1993 to 1994.

5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> were expected during the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving {{a drain on}} the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers first {{joined the}} NFL in 1976 {{as members of}} the AFC West. The {{following}} year, they moved to the NFC Central. The Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.|$|E
5|$|The Indians rehired Peckinpaugh {{as their}} manager in 1941, signing {{him to a}} two-year contract; team {{president}} Alva Bradley, who fired Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, {{he was promoted to}} vice president, later serving as Cleveland's general manager (GM) and president. When Bill Veeck bought the Indians in July 1946, he brought Harry Grabiner and Joseph C. Hostetler with him to serve in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> Peckinpaugh and Bradley resigned.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland pursued former Steelers {{coach and}} Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli {{for the head}} {{coaching}} job. The team, however, hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009. Before {{the start of the}} season, Mangini and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> traded Winslow to the Buccaneers after five seasons marked by injuries and a motorcycle crash that threatened to end the tight end's career. The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini's first year, finishing 5–11 in 2009. While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games, the team won the final four games of the season, including a 13–6 victory over the rival Steelers.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|Nap Lajoie {{discovered}} Peckinpaugh as a {{high school}} student, and signed him to his first professional contract. Peckinpaugh debuted with the Naps, who traded him to the Yankees in 1913. He managed the Yankees for 20 games in 1914 and was the team captain for the remainder of his time with the club. The Senators acquired Peckinpaugh, where he continued to play until his final season, spent with the White Sox. After his playing career, Peckinpaugh managed the Indians from 1928 through 1933 and in 1941. He was also a minor league baseball manager, and served in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office</b> of the Indians and Buffalo Bisons from 1942 through 1947.|$|E

5|$|The Habs {{finished}} the 2011–12 season last in their conference {{for the first}} time in over 80 years, as injuries decimated the team all season. After a disappointing season, the Canadiens started over in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> They fired General Manager Pierre Gauthier, and Marc Bergevin was named the new general manager on May 2, 2012. The search then began for a new head coach and on June 5, Michel Therrien was named the new head coach. This would be Therrien's second stint as the Canadiens head coach after he previously coached the team from 2000 to 2003; and Randy Cunneyworth and Randy Ladouceur were relieved of their assistant coaching duties. On June 15, Gerard Gallant, J. J. Daigneault and Clement Jodoin were added to Montreal's coaching staff as assistant coaches.|$|E
5|$|With the {{acquisition}} of speed in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, Cozy Dolan and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant in 1914. Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals' best finish since 1876, but they fell back to sixth in 1915 and last in 1916. When Britton sold the team after that season, she offered Huggins a chance to buy {{a part of the}} team. While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team's day-to-day operations in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
