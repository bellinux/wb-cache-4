5|$|Bowes Castle {{was built}} within {{the ruins of}} the Roman fort of Lavatrae. The route {{was one of the few}} upland passes to link England and Scotland and had {{remained}} strategically important during the medieval period. The castle site lay within the Honour of Richmond, a grouping of lands traditionally owned by the Counts of Brittany during the early medieval period, but <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself</b> was a demesne estate, owned by the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Superman pursues Luthor, who {{has made}} his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell {{surrounding}} the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself</b> toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs beat Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.|$|E
50|$|The {{organizational}} {{planning of}} <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>itself</b> (Operation Neptune) {{was in the}} hands of Admiral Bertram Ramsay. It covered <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> of <b>the</b> troops and their re-supply. Many innovative elements were included in the operation to ensure its success.|$|R
5|$|Flight day 9 {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} preparations for <b>landing,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>itself.</b> Atlantiss deorbit burn {{was performed on}} orbit 128 at around 11:00amEST (16:00UTC), leading to a landing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on Runway 33 of <b>the</b> Shuttle <b>Landing</b> Facility.|$|R

5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove profitable for the Company or its investors, {{partly because of the}} costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself,</b> and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|By 1892, Mogadishu {{was under}} the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of Zanzibar. The Geledi Sultans were {{at the height of}} their power. They {{dominated}} the southern ivory trade, and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland. The Omani Sultans' authority in Mogadishu, however, was largely nominal. When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city, he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi. This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870. The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians, but not <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself,</b> which was Somali owned.|$|E
5|$|Whatever {{the true}} impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased {{for more than}} two decades after 737. Arab {{military}} activity in the Caucasus continued until 741, with Marwan launching repeated expeditions against the various princes of the northern Caucasus, most notably Tuman Shah. Nevertheless, these campaigns, according to Blankinship, seem to have been closer to raids, designed to seize plunder and extract tribute to pay for the upkeep of the Arab army, rather than attempts at permanent conquest. Despite the Umayyad success at establishing a more or less stable frontier anchored at Derbent, Blankinship is also critical of the long-term results of the Second Arab–Khazar War: Arab control was in reality limited to the lowlands and coast, and <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself</b> was too poor to recompense the expenses sustained during the wars. Furthermore, the need to maintain the large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched Syro-Jaziran army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the Muslim civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E

50|$|Two Cypriot torpedo {{boats were}} sent to {{intercept}} the approaching Turkish flotilla, but were destroyed by Turkish air support. <b>The</b> <b>landing</b> <b>itself</b> occurred under no fire, as there were no units of the Cypriot National Guard in the area. The objective of <b>the</b> <b>landed</b> forces was <b>the</b> port town of Kyrenia, some 8 km {{to the east of}} the beach.

50|$|While it is {{certainly}} possible to enjoy the sport of hot air ballooning without a chase vehicle, returning from <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> site by foot, bicycle, or hitch hiking, many balloonists opt {{to be followed by}} their ground crew in some sort of chase vehicle. Crew at <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> site can aid with <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>itself,</b> by catching a drop line and guiding the balloon into a tight space; with extracting the balloon system from a remote location, such as deep in a farmer's field; and with packing up all the equipment.|$|R
25|$|The Kingdom of Mercia predated the {{emergence}} of heraldry, {{so there is no}} authentic Mercian heraldic device. However, later generations have ascribed a variety of devices to the rulers of Mercia or to <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
25|$|It seems {{highly likely}} that the legislators working on the first U.S. Mechanic Lien laws had {{knowledge}} of, and referenced these civil law concepts. Nevertheless, the United States version was original, as it gave builders a more robust right into <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself</b> (versus just the improvement’s value).|$|E
25|$|For {{mainland}} fees, the fee determines {{only the}} area of land available; the number of prims available is determined by <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself.</b> Some mainland regions offer more prims in the same land area.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>landing</b> of Viking 1 in Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976 {{provided}} {{the first opportunity}} to obtain measurements of atmospheric pressure directly {{from the surface of}} Mars. A computation was conducted to predict the atmospheric pressure at <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> site before <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> <b>itself.</b> <b>The</b> relative altitude between occultation points and the Viking 1 site was obtained with the aid of earth-based planetary radar data taken in 1967. The data cover Martian latitudes from 19 deg N to 24 deg N. The investigation indicates that the radio occultation results from Mariner 9 closely correspond to the actual surface pressure on Mars...|$|R
25|$|The {{end of the}} War of 1812 in December 1814 led to a rapid demobilization of British fortications in Upper Canada.

Built quickly, the buildings and casemates inside the fort deteriorated.|$|E
25|$|As {{settlers}} arrived, they occupied allotments {{throughout the}} coast to beyond Waitara. Many had bought land from the New Zealand Company before the company had purchased <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself.</b> Tensions between Maori and settlers soon became evident: a party of settlers were driven from land north of the Waitara River in July 1842 and surveyors were obstructed {{by a group of}} 100 Maori in 1843.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{anthropologist}} Tim Ingold, animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in {{its focus on}} individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds {{that there is a}} primary source, such as <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself</b> or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the Australian Aboriginals are more typically totemic, whereas others like the Inuit are more typically animistic in their worldview.|$|E
25|$|In May 629, the Muslims {{defeated}} several Jewish tribes (including the Banu Nadir) at the Battle of Khaybar. The Jews had surrendered, {{and were}} allowed to remain in Khaybar on the provision that they give half of their annual produce to the Muslims. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself</b> became {{the property of the}} Muslim state. This agreement, Stillman says, did not extend to the Banu Nadir tribe, who were given no quarter. Safiyya's husband, Kenana ibn al-Rabi, was also killed.|$|E
25|$|This is {{followed}} by land law, setting out the procedure {{in the event of}} rival ownership claims over land. Court was convened on <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>itself,</b> with both claimants calling witnesses to support their claims. In the Iorwerth Redaction, it is stated that the claimants were entitled to the representation by both types of lawyer - cyngaws and canllaw. If both claims were deemed to have equal merit, the law allowed for the land to be shared equally between the two claimants.|$|E
