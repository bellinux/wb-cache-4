5|$|John and {{the rebel}} barons did not <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and neither side seriously {{attempted}} {{to implement the}} peace accord. The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised. Disputes began to emerge between those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated and the royalist faction.|$|E

I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic.

5|$|Sky and Lana {{start to}} <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> a little, and during a sleepover {{organised}} by Serena, they {{discover that they}} both like black and white films. They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky {{that she is not}} hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs {{out of the house and}} goes to the Coffee Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass the kiss off as a joke. Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school.|$|E

In more equal societies, people {{are much more}} likely to <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> measures of social capital (the benefits of goodwill, fellowship, mutual sympathy and social connectedness among groups who make up a social units) suggest greater community involvement, and homicide rates are consistently lower.|$|E
25|$|It {{is aimed}} to resolve points of difference, to gain {{advantage}} {{for an individual}} or collective, or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. It is often conducted by putting forward a position and making small concessions to achieve an agreement. The {{degree to which the}} negotiating parties <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to implement the negotiated solution is a major factor in determining whether negotiations are successful. In many cases, negotiation is not a zero-sum game, allowing for cooperation to improve the results of the negotiation.|$|E
500|$|Glen Morgan {{began writing}} the episode after he read a Science News article about men in Greenland who found a 250,000-year-old item encased in ice. The setting—an icy, remote {{research}} base overcome by an extraterrestrial creature—is {{similar to that}} of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There? and its two feature-film incarnations: The Thing from Another World (1951), directed by Christian Nyby and produced by Howard Hawks, and The Thing (1982), directed by John Carpenter. Chris Carter has cited them as the main inspirations for the episode. As in the novella and films, the characters cannot <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> because they are uncertain if they are who they seem to be. Carter particularly enjoyed this aspect, because it pitted Mulder and Scully against each other and provided [...] "a new look on their characters early on in the series".|$|E

60|$|Letitia and Grace, as {{two older}} sisters of families, had a {{peculiar}} intimacy, and discussed every thing together, from {{the mode of}} clearing jelly up to the profoundest problems of science and morals.

500|$|The {{score is}} a sparse {{arrangement}} of strings and piano (with {{the addition of}} oboe and harp in one cut), intended to convey the sadness of the King's muteness, and then the growing warmth of friendship between him and Logue. The minimalist approach emphasises the protagonist's struggle for control. Desplat used the repetition of a single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech. As the film progresses, growing banks of warm strings swaddle the deepening friendship between the two leads. The music rises to a climax in the coronation scene. Hooper originally wanted to film the scene without music, but Desplat {{argued that it was}} the real climax of the story—the point when the friendship was ratified by their decision to <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> [...] "That is really rare", said Desplat, [...] "mostly you have love stories".|$|E
500|$|Tensions between Tipu and the Nizam and the British {{were raised}} when, in 1788, the East India Company gained {{control over the}} Circar of Guntur, the southernmost of the Northern Circars, {{pursuant}} to an earlier agreement with the Nizam. [...] In exchange, the company agreed to station some of its troops with the Hyderabadi army. By 1789, tensions between Tipu and his neighbours and vassals to Mysore's west, including the Kingdom of Travancore, also rose noticeably. [...] Travancore, listed in the 1784 treaty as a British ally, acquired from the Dutch East India Company two forts located within the territory of Cochin, a Mysorean vassal state. [...] The Dutch had never paid tribute to anyone for these forts since gaining control of them, {{but the fact that}} they were within Cochin's bounds was sufficient for Tipu to dispute Travancore's claim. [...] He began massing troops at Coimbatore and making threatening gestures toward Dharma Raja of Travancore. [...] British authorities in Madras warned Tipu that acts of aggression against Travancore would be met with a British response, and Cornwallis began urging John Holland, the governor of Madras, to begin military preparations. [...] On 29 December 1789, Tipu attacked Travancore's defences. Hollond, however, was not a military man, and rather than acting with vigour, he temporised and attempted negotiation with Tipu. He was replaced in early 1790 by General William Medows, to whom Cornwallis gave the authority for a military campaign against Mysore. Cornwallis began negotiating with the Marathas and the Nizam for their support, since the British forces in India were significantly lacking in cavalry, one of Tipu's strengths. The Marathas and the Nizam both had significant cavalry forces, and they were interested in recovering territories lost to Mysore in earlier conflicts. [...] However, they were too weak to attack Mysore individually, and did not <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> so they preferred to wait until it was clear the British were committed to act against Mysore.|$|E

Then Major Joe Craven (James Garner), another close friend of Bond's, is killed when a wing of his XF-120 tears away, confirming Bond's warning. Bond's rehabilitation is endangered when a drunk Major [...] "Bromo" [...] Lee (Murray Hamilton), Banner's top test pilot, tries to pick a fight {{with him at the}} officers club. Bond reacts badly to being held by a bystander, invoking memories of his Korean War imprisonment, and punches Bromo twice.|$|E
50|$|This {{treaty was}} not {{sustained}} {{because the two}} sides mutually liked or <b>trusted</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The treaty was successful because of economics.

If emulations run much faster than humans, {{there might not be}} enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It's possible that humans would react violently against growing power of emulations, especially if they depress human wages. Or maybe emulations wouldn't <b>trust</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and even well intentioned defensive measures might be interpreted as offense.|$|E
