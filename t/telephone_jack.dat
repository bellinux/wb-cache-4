50|$|RJ11 is a {{physical}} interface often used for terminating telephone wires. It {{is probably the most}} familiar of the registered jacks, being used for single line POTS <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> in most homes across the world.|$|R
50|$|Modular {{connectors}} {{were originally}} developed and patented by General Cable Corp in 1974. They replaced the hard-wired connections on most Western Electric telephones around 1976. At the same time, {{they began to}} replace screw terminals and larger 3 and 4 pin <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> in buildings.|$|R
50|$|A modular {{connector}} is {{an electrical}} connector that was originally {{designed for use}} in telephone wiring, but has since been used for many other purposes. Many applications that originally used a bulkier, more expensive connector have converted to modular connectors. Probably the most well known applications of modular connectors are for <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> and for Ethernet jacks, {{both of which are}} nearly always modular connectors.|$|R
50|$|Any {{telephone}} exchange {{is an example}} of an FXS, as is the <b>telephone</b> <b>jack</b> on the wall, though the term is rarely applied except in connection with foreign exchange service.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 1970s, AT&T {{introduced}} modular connectors for {{the line}} cord and handset cords, requiring the [...] RJ11 standard home <b>telephone</b> <b>jack.</b> Most customers who had Princess telephones {{were converted to}} modular jacks.|$|E
50|$|Despite the name, most smartjacks {{are much}} more than a simple <b>telephone</b> <b>jack.</b> One common form for a smartjack is a printed circuit board with a face plate on one edge, mounted in an enclosure.|$|E
50|$|The {{telecommunications}} infrastructure in Gibraltar is modelled on {{that of the}} UK; for example; the ringing tone of fixed telephone lines is identical {{to that of the}} UK, although that of mobile phones may resemble that of mainland Europe, with long tones. <b>Telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> are also British Standard BS 6312, as opposed to the RJ11 versions found in other parts of Europe and the world.|$|R
50|$|Telephone installers who wired RJ45S modem <b>jacks</b> or RJ61X <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> were {{familiar}} with the pin assignments that were part of the standard. However, the standard un-keyed modular connectors became ubiquitous for computer networking, and informally inherited the name RJ45. While RJ45S uses a keyed variety of the 8P body, meaning it may have an extra tab that a common modular connector cannot mate with, the visual difference is subtle and likely caused the confusion.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, two {{copper wires}} (tip and ring) for each {{telephone}} line run {{from a home}} or other small building to a local telephone exchange. There is a central junction box for the building where the wires that go to <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> throughout the building and wires that go to the exchange meet and can be connected in different configurations depending upon the subscribed telephone service. The wires between the junction box and the exchange are known as the local loop, and the network of wires going to an exchange, the access network.|$|R
50|$|The LK201 {{keyboard}} {{supplied with}} the VT220 {{was one of}} the first full-length, low-profile keyboards available; it was developed at DEC's Roxbury, Massachusetts facility. It was much smaller and lighter than the VT100s version, and connected to the terminal using a lighter and more flexible coiled cable and a <b>telephone</b> <b>jack</b> connector.|$|E
5000|$|Three Logan Square, {{formerly}} the Bell Atlantic Tower, is a 55-story high-rise office building located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Standing 739 ft (225 m) tall to its structural top, the building encloses 1300000 sq ft of office space. The building, {{designed by the}} Philadelphia-based architecture firm Kling Lindquist, was completed in 1991. The design of the building resembles a RJ-11 <b>telephone</b> <b>jack</b> ...|$|E
50|$|A {{telephone}} plug {{is a type}} of connector used to connect a telephone set to the telephone wiring inside a building, establishing a connection to a telephone network. It is inserted into its counterpart, a <b>telephone</b> <b>jack,</b> commonly affixed to a wall or baseboard. The standard for {{telephone plug}}s varies from country to country, though the RJ11 modular connector has become by far the most common.|$|E
5000|$|Quarter-inch phone {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used to connect external processing devices to mixing consoles' insert points (see Insert (effects processing)). Two- or three-conductor phone connectors might be used in pairs as separate send and return jacks, or a single three-conductor phone jack might be employed for both send and return, {{in which case the}} signals are unbalanced. The one unbalanced combination send/return TRS insert jack saves both panel space and component complexity, but may introduce a slight buzz. Insert points on mixing consoles may also be XLR, RCA or bantam TT (tiny <b>telephone)</b> <b>jacks,</b> depending on the make and model.|$|R
5000|$|... 10BASE-T/100BASE-T and modular <b>jack</b> <b>telephone</b> line modem {{interfaces}} are for {{an internet}} connection.|$|R
50|$|The machine's {{hardware}} {{consisted of}} a 9-inch (229 mm) black-and-white monitor, a single 3Â½-inch 256 KB floppy disk drive and an IBM Selectric-compatible keyboard. It used a Motorola 68000 CPU (like the Macintosh, Lisa, Atari ST and Amiga) running at 5 MHz, had 256 KB of RAM, and an internal 300/1200 bit/s modem. Setup and user preference data was stored in 8 KB of non-volatile (battery backed-up) RAM. The Cat's array of I/O interfaces encompassed one Centronics parallel port, one RS-232C serial port (DB-25), and two RJ11 <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> for the modem loop. The total weight of the system was 17 pounds (7.7 kg).|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{towards the}} end users from the switch, the {{softswitch}} may be connected to several access devices via TCP/IP network. These access devices can range from small Analog Telephone Adaptors (ATA) which provide just one RJ11 <b>telephone</b> <b>jack</b> to an Integrated Access Device (IAD), eMTA s (embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapters) using MGCP/NCS protocol over cable (VoCable) or PBX which may provide several hundred telephone connections ...|$|E
5000|$|The DECT {{standard}} specifies a {{means for}} a portable phone or [...] "Portable Part" [...] to access a fixed telephone network via radio. Base station or [...] "Fixed Part" [...] is used to terminate the radio link and provide access to a fixed line. gateway is then used to connect calls to the fixed network, such as {{public switched telephone network}} (<b>telephone</b> <b>jack),</b> office PBX, ISDN, or VoIP over Ethernet connection.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{abilities}} {{of a domestic}} DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP) system include multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket. This allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house, all operating from the same <b>telephone</b> <b>jack.</b> Additional handsets have a battery charger station that does not plug into the telephone system. Handsets can in many cases be used as intercoms, communicating between each other, and sometimes as walkie-talkies, intercommunicating without telephone line connection.|$|E
50|$|DSL signals may be {{degraded}} {{by older}} telephone lines, surge protectors, poorly designed microfilters, Repetitive Electrical Impulse Noise, and by long telephone extension cords. Telephone extension cords are typically made with small-gauge, multi-strand copper conductors {{which do not}} maintain a noise-reducing pair twist. Such cable is more susceptible to electromagnetic interference and has more attenuation than solid twisted-pair copper wires typically wired to <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks.</b> These effects are especially significant where the customer's phone line is more than 4 km from the DSLAM in the telephone exchange, which causes the signal levels to be lower relative to any local noise and attenuation. This will {{have the effect of}} reducing speeds or causing connection failures.|$|R
50|$|In modern times, most {{telephones}} are {{plugged into}} <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks.</b> The jacks are connected by inside wiring to a drop wire which connects {{the building to}} a cable. Cables usually bring {{a large number of}} drop wires from all over a district access network to one wire center or telephone exchange. When a telephone user wants to make a telephone call, equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same wire center, or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|R
50|$|The first DECtalk {{units were}} seen in 1984. They were {{standalone}} units that connected to any device with an asynchronous serial port. These units were also able to connect to the telephone system by having two <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks.</b> One connected to a phone line, the other to a telephone. The DECtalk units could recognize and generate any telephone touch tone. With that capability the units {{could be used to}} automate various telephone-related tasks by handling both incoming and outgoing calls. This included acting as an interface to an email system and the capability to function as an alerting system by utilizing the ability to place calls and interact via touch tones with the person answering the phone.|$|R
5000|$|Use of the SoftBook did {{not require}} a desktop {{computer}} or an Internet service provider; it had an RJ11 <b>telephone</b> <b>jack</b> and internal 33.6 kbit/s modem {{to connect with the}} [...] "SoftBookstore" [...] to download books. Publishers included HarperCollins, McGraw-Hill, Simon & Schuster, Warner Books, and others, and subscriptions to periodicals such as Newsweek, Time, and The Wall Street Journal were available (which could be downloaded automatically overnight if users kept the device plugged into a phone jack). Users could upload their own documents via SoftBook's Internet website for downloading to their SoftBook.|$|E
50|$|In the Trimline version {{designed}} for connection to an RJ11 <b>telephone</b> <b>jack,</b> pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry very low voltage AC or DC power. While {{the phone line}} itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the phone line could supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near one <b>telephone</b> <b>jack,</b> wired to supply power to just that telephone (or {{to all of the}} jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices). It is now usually recommended that only the one local jack used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that might be using pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow pair) in jacks {{in other parts of the}} house. The early Trimline and Princess phone dial light incandescent lamps were rated at 6.3 Volts, 0.25 Amp and the transformer output is approximately 6-8 Volts AC. Later Trimline versions had LED light sources, powered directly from the phone line, and the last Western Electric-made Princess version had no dial light.|$|E
50|$|A {{side effect}} of the move to the self-install model is that the DSL signal can be degraded, {{especially}} if more than 5 voiceband (that is, POTS telephone-like) devices {{are connected to the}} line. Once a line has had DSL enabled, the DSL signal is present on all telephone wiring in the building, causing attenuation and echo. A way to circumvent this is {{to go back to the}} original model, and install one filter upstream from all telephone jacks in the building, except for the jack to which the DSL modem will be connected. Since this requires wiring changes by the customer, and may not work on some household telephone wiring, it is rarely done. It is usually much easier to install filters at each <b>telephone</b> <b>jack</b> that is in use.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is how the}} sensor (through its cable, if applicable) is attached to its alarm or transmitter {{in the case of}} wired alarms or wireless alarms. Some wireless alarms are truly wireless, with the transmitter being part of the sensor and completely self-contained. For wired alarms, the sensor's wire (or cable) runs from the sensor (located at the point of urination) underneath the user's pajama shirt to wherever the alarm is located on the body (frequently on the collar of the pajama shirt, so that it is close to the ear). The attachment mechanism to the alarm, through which the electric current flows to the alarm, is important. If it is easily detached (unintentionally comes out from the alarm during use) the alarm may not be triggered. Most connectors are plastic <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> which are very unlikely to be detached unintentionally (RJ-11, RJ-12, 616E, etc.).|$|R
50|$|A small device, {{about the}} size of a home {{wireless}} router, contains the necessary electronics which allow plain old telephone service to be provided to one or two <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> on the back of the unit, as well as having a small radio antenna and a transceiver for the wireless side of the connection. LED indicator lights on the front typically show signal strength and voicemail messages waiting. The devices usually cannot provide enough ringing current for more than one phone and one externally powered device, such as a telephone answering device or the base station for a cordless phone. For this reason, it is not recommended to connect these devices to a home's wiring (which also requires the disconnection of the wiring at the network interface device, just as when a cable telephone or other whole-home VoIP service is installed). A rechargeable battery backup is normally provided to run the device during a power outage lasting no more than a few hours, significantly less standby time than a true mobile device.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, ADC {{sold its}} {{audiometer}} product line and Ralph Allison {{left the company}} {{to form a new}} business in California. ADC diversified and focused its efforts in the area of transformers and filters for power lines, military electronics, <b>telephone</b> <b>jacks</b> and plugs. In 1961, ADC merged with Magnetic Controls Company, a manufacturer of power supplies and magnetic amplifiers with strong ties to the U.S. space program. The resulting company, ADC Magnetic Controls, had a decade of mixed success. Although transformer sales boomed during the 1960s, other new product initiatives failed to materialize. Perhaps the most significant product innovation during this period was the bantam jack, a miniaturized component that eventually became the standard for telephone circuit access and patching. Building on its growing sales of jacks and plugs in the early 1970s, ADC introduced prewired, connectorized jackfields, wired assemblies and test equipment for telephone operating companies. By 1974 the company was on solid ground, and by 1976, ADC had become the largest independent supplier of test boards in the United States.|$|R
