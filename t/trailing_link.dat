25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone box-section ladder-type steel frame. Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, <b>trailing</b> <b>link,</b> and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and coil springs replaced the Silverstone’s leaf springs, while the beam axle was located by Panhard rod.|$|E
25|$|In {{motorcycles}} with {{telescopic fork}} tubes, fork offset {{can be implemented}} by either an offset in the triple tree, adding a triple tree rake (usually measured in degrees from 0) to the fork tubes as they mount into the triple tree, {{or a combination of}} the two. Other, less-common motorcycle forks, such as <b>trailing</b> <b>link</b> or leading link forks, can implement offset by the length of link arms.|$|E
2500|$|Indian {{introduced}} the 221cc single cylinder two-stroke Model K [...] "Featherweight" [...] in 1916. The Model K had an open cradle frame {{with the engine}} as a stressed member and a pivoting front fork {{that had been used}} earlier on single-cylinder motorcycles but had mostly been replaced on other Indian motorcycles by a leaf-sprung <b>trailing</b> <b>link</b> fork.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1986 the CB71 {{became the}} CB72 after a rather {{thorough}} facelift. The headlights were new, of the wraparound sort {{and the interior}} was changed with a new dashboard, but the main changes were under the skin: the old rear suspension was replaced with Suzuki's patented ITL suspension (Isolated <b>Trailing</b> <b>Link).</b> This three-link rigid setup considerably improved the ride. By February 1987, the Fronte became available as a three-door, with the FS Twin Cam 12 version with a [...] at 7500rpm, DOHC 12-valve F5A engine (FR in the five-door version). The engine had two horsepower more in the Alto; {{this is due to}} less stringent emissions standards for commercial vehicles. In August 1987 a three-speed automatic transmission became available, and lastly there was also a pert-time four-wheel drive version of the five-door CB72 Fronte (the CD72S, from January 1988). By September, the CB/CD72 was replaced. The 1988 Suzuki Cervo used the chassis, front clip and door panels from the CB/CD72 Fronte.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>link</b> front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E
