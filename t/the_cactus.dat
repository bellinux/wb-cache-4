5|$|Spines, {{which are}} {{modified}} leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing {{the evolution of}} spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells. Spines provide protection from herbivores and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near the surface of <b>the</b> <b>cactus,</b> creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and transpiration. They can provide some shade, which lowers {{the temperature of the}} surface of <b>the</b> <b>cactus,</b> also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.|$|E

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} quasi–operads and consider four (quasi) –operads which are different varieties of <b>the</b> <b>cacti</b> operad appearing in string topology. These are cacti without local zeros (or spines) and cacti proper as well as both varieties with fixed constant size one of the constituting loops. Using the recognition principle of Fiedorowicz, we prove that spineless cacti are weakly homotopy equivalent to the little discs operad. It turns out {{that in terms of}} spineless <b>cacti</b> <b>the</b> Gerstenhaber structure [C] and the braided operad structure [F] are explicitly given by the same chains. We also prove that spineless cacti and cacti are weakly homotopy equivalent to their normalized versions, by showing that both types of cacti are semi–direct products of the quasi–operad of their normalized versions with a re–scaling operad based on R> 0. Furthermore, we {{introduce the}} notion of bi–crossed products of quasi–operads and show that <b>the</b> <b>cacti</b> proper are a bi–crossed product of <b>the</b> operad of <b>cacti</b> without spines and the operad based on the monoid given by the circle group S 1.

5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} prickly pear cactus in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate <b>the</b> <b>cactus</b> on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E
