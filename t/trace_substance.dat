40|$|Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to define global mean concentrations of trace substances and to incorporate these into global models of net source and sink strengths of the various natural and anthropogenic atmospheric con-taminants. One of the most extensive was certainly the work of Robinson & Robbins (1967). However, it now appears with increasing clarity that such models are a t best mathemati-cal abstractions. Many substances really do not become a part of the global atmosphere, in the sense that they are mixed meridionally through-out the atmosphere. Their lifetimes are rather short compared with such mixing times. The concept is discussed a t rather more length by Kellogg et al. (1972). It therefore seems more meaningful to discuss zonal mean values, and perhaps to distinguish variations on a still smaller scale.

Nanofiltration for drinking water treatment is mainly used for softening and the removal of humic substances. Recently nanofiltration is sometimes used also for the removal of organic trace substances. The mechanism of the <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> transport through Nanofiltration membranes is widely unknown. Therefor {{it is not possible to}} predict pesticiderejections. Thus one focus of this thesis is the investigation of the rejection of organic trace substances through nanofiltration membranes. By measuring diffusion constants of several electrical uncharged pesticides it could be shown that the size of the molecules is a contributing factor. Due to attached water molecules it is not possible to calculate this "effective" molecule size by molecule modelling programs. To investigat the steric effects the rejection dependent of pH was investigated because the membrane pore size distribution depends on pH. The oppositional behaviour of the rejection and the permeability underlines the steric influence on rejection as well as a mathematical model. With electric charged organic trace substances the electrostatic interactions between the membrane surface and the organic molecule dominates the transport mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} of trace substances to a coniferous forest {{has been estimated}} {{by means of a}} one-dimensional cloud droplet deposition model. For a period of 21 months the liquid water content has been measured and 89 samples of cloud water from the weather station Feldberg have been analysed for chemical composition. These data and meteorological routine observations have been used as input parameters for the deposition model. Deposition calculations to a 40 years old coniferous forest for the period 1982 - 1991 showed that the cloud water deposition amounts to 33 % of the precipitation amount on the average and varies between 23 and 43 % in single years. The highest cloud water deposition rates occur during fall and winter. The <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> concentration in cloud water {{has been found to be}} higher than in precipitation, by a factor between 6 and 12, depending on the type of ions. Typically seasonal variations of normalized ion concentrations could be shown to exist as well as dependencies on wind direction. Air mass transport from the industries of the Stuttgart area resulted in higher <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> concentrations in cloud water. The {{deposition of}} trace substances via fog interception during the summer months is as high and in the winter months higher than that by wet deposition. The forests at high elevations of Black Forest are charged appreciably by fog interception. (orig.) Die Spurenstoffdeposition auf einen Nadelwald wurde mit Hilfe eines eindimensionalen Wolkentropfendepositionsmodells abgeschaetzt. Dazu wurden ueber 21 Monate Messungen des Fluessigwassergehalts an der Wetterstation Feldberg vorgenommen und 89 Nebelproben zur chemischen Analyse des Wolkenwassers gesammelt. Diese Messdaten und meteorologische Routinebeobachtungen der Wetterstation dienten als Eingangsparameter fuer das Depositionsmodell. Als Modellwald diente ein 10 m hoher, 40 Jahre alter Tannenwald. Die Rechnungen fuer den Zeitraum 1982 - 1991 zeigten, dass die deponierte Nebelwassermenge im langjaehrigen Mittel 33 % der Niederschlagsmenge betraegt, in Einzeljahren schwankt dieser Prozentsatz zwischen 23 und 43 %. Die hoechsten Nebelwasserdepositionen finden im Herbst und Winter statt. Im Nebelwasser liegt die Spurenstoffkonzentration je nach Ionenart 6 - 12 mal hoeher als im Regenwasser.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{chemically}} characterise emissions and ambient concentrations of superficial aerosols in an industrial region using a methodologically broad approach. Temporal and spatial variabilities were quantified for scales ranging from 1 to 1000 kilometres and from time of day to time of year, respectively. The degree of accumulation of aerosol constituents in air masses passing over metropolitan areas was quantified on the basis of two episodes near Berlin, i. e. for an industrial and an agricultural region subject to strong anthropogenic influences. Heavy metal concentrations in air-borne dust were found to be at least as high at rural locations in this region as they were at urban locations, and all heavy metals found were predominantly of anthropogenic origin. The data analysis entailed pioneer work, involving amongst other things an improved use of backward trajectories and of the partly mutually independent variables observable <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> concentration (mueg/m- 3) and <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> ratio in the particle phase (mg/g). Major new insights were gained with regard to the occurrence of dicarbonic acids, which are quantitatively probably the most significant component of the organic fraction of the particulate material. For this purpose a simple fluid chromatographic method was developed. However, the formation pathways of dicarbonic acids, and of secondary organic particulate material in general, still remain to be clarified. Information gathered on animal husbandry as a potential aerosol source, incidentally another pioneer accomplishment of this study, revealed insights that merit a closer study of this emission source. In einem methodisch breiten Ansatz wurde das bodennahe Aerosol in der Industrieregion in Immission und Emission chemisch charakterisiert. Die raeumlichen und zeitlichen Variabilitaeten wurden in den Skalenbereichen 1 - 1000 km bzw. Tageszeiten-Jahreszeiten quantifiziert. In welchem Masse Luftmassen beim Transport ueber Ballungsgebieten mit Aerosolinhaltsstoffen angereichert werden, konnte anhand zweier Episoden bei Berlin quantifiziert werden. Der Luftstaub war an laendlichen Orten der stark anthropogen gepraegten Industrie- und Agrarregion mindestens gleich stark wie an den urbanen durch Schwermetalle vornehmlich anthropogenen Ursprungs angereichert.

40|$|The {{study of}} chaotic mixing is {{important}} for its potential to improve our understanding of fluid systems. Contour advection simulations provide a good model of the phenomenon by tracking the evolution {{of one or more}} contours or isolines of a <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> to a high level of precision. The most accurate method of validating an advected contour is to divide the tracer concentration into discrete ranges and perform a maximum likelihood classification, a method that we term, "isoline retrieval. " Conditional probabilities generated as a result provide excellent error characterization. In this study, a water vapour isoline of 0. 001 mass-mixing-ratio is advected over five days in the upper troposphere and compared with high-resolution AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) satellite retrievals. The goal is to find the same fine-scale, chaotic mixing in the isoline retrievals as seen in the advection simulations. Some of the filaments generated by the simulations show up in the conditional probabilities as areas of reduced probability. By rescaling the probabilities, the filaments may be revealed in the isoline retrievals proper with little effect on the overall accuracy. Limitations imposed by the specific context, i. e. water-vapour retrieved with AMSU in the upper troposphere, are discussed. Nonetheless, isoline retrieval is shown to be a highly effective technique for atmospheric sounding, showing good agreement with both ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts) assimilation data and radiosonde measurements.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{advanced}} models to characterize microfluidic flows from image sequences. The governing equations and boundary conditions for viscous flows are introduced {{as a global}} model in order to impose physically sound motion results. The connection between the computational fluid simulations and experimental measurement data is established by using constrained optimization. This framework also allows to introduce control variables, which are determined {{in agreement with the}} underlying data. In this context, the thesis focuses on the study of the influence of i) the image data, ii) the underlying motion and iii) the boundary conditions on the estimation of the control variables and the corresponding physical quantities. These questions are assessed by the application to synthetic images that allow to measure the induced errors. It is shown that the application of physically motivated differential equations as global motion models increase the robustness and accuracy of the motion estimation. Control variables are used to change the equations in a modeled manner, so that the solution describes the processes that are inherent in the images. The strength of global models lies in the combination with sparsely distributed information in the images, where common state-of- the-art methods have extreme difficulties to obtain reasonable results. It is demonstrated that the optimal control framework allows to relax the governing equations in order to model uncertainty of the measurement setting parameters, such as wall-slip. And finally, such a parameter model is extended to three dimensions and allows to estimate the pressure drop of the flow and the diffusion coefficient of the <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> caged Q-rhodamine dextran in water...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{that have}} {{attempted}} to estimate sources and sinks of trace gases such as CO 2 with inverse calculations unanimously identify the lack of continental stations as a prime obstacle. Continental stations have traditionally been avoided {{because of the difficulty}} of interpretation due to large time-variability of <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> mixing ratios. Large variability is caused by the proximity to the strongly variable sources in space and time and the complicated airflow within the lowermost 100 - 200 m of the planetary boundary layer. To address the need for continental stations and to overcome the problems associated with them, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory started in 1992 to measure CO 2 and other trace gases on tall television transmission towers [Bakwin et al, 1995]. An essential question in connection with these tower measurements is the area around the tower from which fluxes substantially contribute to the observed short-term variability of trace gas mixing ratios. We present here a simple data and back trajectory-based method to estimate the fraction of the observed short-term variability explained by a localized flux around a tall television transmission tower in Wisconsin in dependence of its location relative to the tower (the concentration "footprint"). We find that the timescale over which the imprint of surface fluxes on air parcels before its arrival at the tower axe still discernible in the mixing ratio variations observed at the tower is of the order of 1. 5 days. Based on this timescale and the characteristics of air parcel trajectories, we infer a spatial extent of the footprint of the order of 10 (6) km(2), or roughly a tenth of the area of the United States. This is encouraging evidence that tall tower measurements may be useful in global inversions and may also have implications for monitoring fluxes of anthropogenic trace substances on regional scales.

40|$|The fast {{dynamics}} {{of a large}} pilot scale nitrifying trickling filter (NTF) using effluent waste water from Rya Waste Water Treatment Plant in Göteborg, Sweden, has been investigated experimentally and by simulations. The plant is 7. 2 m high, have a diameter of 2. 7 m, and {{was filled with a}} cross-flow media with a specific surface area of 226 m^ 2 /m^ 3. Continuous ammonium meters connected to the NTF measured influent and effluent ammonium concentrations. Two different phenomena may affect the fast dynamics in this type of biofilm reactors: The mixing in the bulk flow and the dynamics within the biofilm, i. e. the mixing in the biofilm and the response time for the bacteria to changes in substrate concentrations. Pulse response experiments conducted at two different flows (7. 3 l/s and 14. 5 l/s), where dissolved LiCl was used as <b>trace</b> <b>substance,</b> showed that the flow through the NTF could not be characterized as laminar, but significant mixing occurs inside the plant. The residence time distributions are well approximated by four identical continuously stirred tanks in series, and from the mean residence time the liquid film thickness was estimated to be 0. 5 mm. Two experiments, where the influent ammonium concentration was rapidly increased while the flow was held constant at 14 l/s, were also conducted as well as an experiment where the flow was stochastically varied around 12 l/s. Comparisons are made between the measured effluent concentrations in these experiments and simulations of a model of the plant, where the NTF is divided into a series of continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) having the total volume estimated from the pulse response experiments. The nitrification rate in each CSTR is modelled as a first order dynamic system driven by a physically derived expression of the stationary nitrification rate. Simulations for different values of the time constant of this dynamic system, and comparisons with the experimental data, shows that the dynamics within the biofilm are much faster than the {{dynamics of}} the mixing in the bulk. Implicitly, this means that the response times for the nitrifying bacteria to changes in ammonium bulk concentration were less than a few minutes. Hence, the fast dynamics in the biofilm can in many cases be neglected, which greatly facilitates simulations of many nitrifying biofilm reactors when more complex biofilm models are used...|$|E

40|$|Fractions of bovine white matter, {{prepared}} by the methods of Folch and Lees, were studied for chemical composition and {{for their ability to}} produce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rabbits. Evaluation of the disease and of the lesions in animals injected with the more active fractions at several dose levels permitted comparison of the antigenic activity of these materials. When tissue was fractionated by the methods of Folch and Lees, antigenic activity was found in the chloroform-methanol extract but not in the denatured tissue residue. This activity was traced to proteolipides A and B and to the lower phase, more specifically the ether-soluble fraction of the lower phase. Proteolipide C was inactive. Correlation of the chemistry of fractions with their antigenic activity suggested two possibilities: (a) that there might be two antigens, one proteolipide and the other non-proteolipide; or (b) that a small specific proteolipide is responsible for all the observed activity. The high concentration of acetal phosphatide in the ether-soluble lower phase suggested that compounds of this type might be the hypothetical non-proteolipide antigen, but this hypothesis was disproved by analytic study of active and inactive materials. The possibility that proteolipide might account for all the antigenic activity was strongly supported by the experimental finding that total lipide and proteolipide progressively lost activity as proteolipide was degraded by adequate processing. The use of an entirely different method for preparing total lipides free of proteolipide (the colloidal iron technique) indicated that this loss of activity did not result from incidental removal of some non-proteolipide antigen. These tentative conclusions are in agreement with those of Tal and Olitsky and provide a satisfactory interpretation of the findings of Goldstein et al. The very fact, however, that the suggested proteolipide antigen would amount to no more than 1 per cent of the total chloroform-methanol extractives leaves open the possibility that some unrecognized <b>trace</b> <b>substance</b> may be the antigen. Skin tests with the various fractions indicated some cross-reactivity between proteolipides A and B and the ether-soluble lower phase fraction and a fair correlation of positive skin reactions with disease. This finding is compatible with the suggestion that the same antigen is present in both of these types of material. When the disease produced by whole tissue or fractions was evaluated by the use of the proportion of animals developing disease, the day of onset, and the severity of the histologic lesions, it was found that fractions produced milder disease of later onset than intact tissue at all dose levels. The disease-producing activity was not enhanced by increasing the dose; i. e., it appeared to reach an asymptotic maximum below that obtainable with whole fresh tissue. This finding suggests both a quantitative loss of activity and a qualitative change during the initial chloroform-methanol extraction, a procedure which denatures all proteins in the tissue residue. A comparable change appeared to occur in whole white matter stored at – 15 °C. for 15 months and thawed and refrozen several times during this period. The later fractionation steps resulted in no apparent loss of antigenic activity. A scoring method employing the same type of data to estimate the actual relative antigen contents of different preparations is presented in the Appendix...|$|E
