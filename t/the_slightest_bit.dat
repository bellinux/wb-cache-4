5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> of {{humidity}} or rain. The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{improvements}} The Book of Air has over its predecessors is a system of hints for locating difficult items. Although {{it is still possible}} to get hung up on some of the game's more taxing brainteasers, players will no longer find themselves stuck trying to find items thanks to a recharging magnifying glass 'hint power' {{that can be used to}} reveal an object's location. But if there are not any, the power of hints is not used. There are two difficulty modes to play, Casual and Challenge. Each mode has the same puzzles but their complexities are different. At the beginning, the game offers players the option to play in either Casual or Challenge Mode, and if they want the game to offer <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> of resistance they would pick the former. While Casual Mode offers simpler puzzles and the ability to skip them if players get stuck long enough, Challenge Mode offers slightly harder puzzles, but will not let players skip any. Players cannot change the difficulty once they have chosen it.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} agreed that the episode was darker than previous episodes, but not as funny. However, Will Dean, writing in The Independent, said that his observation that the episode [...] "wasn't really in <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> funny" [...] was [...] "no complaint". The critical response to [...] "Tom & Gerri" [...] was overwhelmingly positive; Dean was [...] "moved by its sad brilliance", while Gerald Gilbert, also writing in The Independent, called it [...] "another finely worked playlet". Bruce Dessau said viewers would be [...] "totally immersed from start to finish".|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff you can do with it... things that Rick was not in <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E

[...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book.

500|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, cult films have become {{increasingly}} popular. [...] Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream, and showings of cult films {{have proved to be}} a profitable business venture. [...] Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> weird or unconventional; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic. [...] Films are frequently stated to be an [...] "instant cult classic" [...] now, occasionally before they are released. [...] Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release. [...] At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, thanks to spreading virally through social media. [...] Easy access to cult films via video on demand and peer-to-peer file sharing has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films.|$|E
500|$|The program {{received}} a lukewarm reception from critics. Chris Willman from the Los Angeles Times said the program's title was misleading because [...] "it's {{hard to find}} anything <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> untraditional about [...] ". Willman commended the 1960s influence reminiscent of her father's Christmas songs and said the special was [...] "a good-enough live video counterpart" [...] to the album with an obvious inclusion of 'The Christmas Song'". John J. O'Conner of The New York Times gave it a negative review, saying, [...] "a couple of new songs are forgettable" [...] and describing Cole's performance as [...] "sweetly, and somewhat lifelessly", and the production as unable to leave a lasting impression on the viewers. O'Connor also said Cole's rendition of [...] "The Christmas Song" [...] was {{the highlight of the}} show and, [...] "Ms. Cole once again dips in the repertory of her incomparable father". He compared the program to [...] "Perry Como's Irish Christmas" [...] and said both had [...] "the same lulling level". Following Cole's death on December 31, 2015, PBS released a statement saying [...] "we are grateful {{to have been able to}} capture [...] extraordinary artistry for generations to come" [...] through her Great Performances solo specials including her Christmas special.|$|E

500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when it gets a bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots." [...] It further added that [...] "'Celebration' [...] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base and a nice bookend to her collection of chart glories." ...|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Human Behaviour" [...] {{features}} a [...] "bouncing riff" [...] sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim, with [...] "its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument, the timpani." [...] Its lyrics [...] refer to Björk's {{experience as a}} child, finding the behaviour of adults [...] "rather chaotic and nonsensical," [...] instead finding harmony with other children, nature and animals. Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough, she sings {{from the point of}} view of an animal, with its opening line being [...] "If you ever get close to a human/And human behaviour/Be ready, be ready to get confused". Following track [...] "Crying" [...] shows a contradiction between its [...] "bubbly, shiny-surfaced acid disco-pop" [...] sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in a big city. [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] —considered an ambient track by Rolling Stone— reflected Björk's newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably Talvin Singh. In a spontaneous fashion, the song's strings —and also those of [...] "Come to Me"— were recorded by a fim studio orchestra in India. The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, with lyrics that have been described as [...] "sweet and just <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> naughty." [...] In the dancefloor-oriented [...] "There's More to Life Than This", Björk leaves romance behind, with [...] "her mischievous side [...] to the fore". Its lyrics were inspired by a party she attended and promptly left. [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] is one of the several jazz standards the singer recorded with Corky Hale, with her voice [...] "cradled in harp and swoony strings." ...|$|E
500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>bit</b> fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure." [...] The game was the lead story on SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline [...] "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan." ...|$|E
