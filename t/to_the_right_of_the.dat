5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman. The player-character {{automatically}} moves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen through procedurally generated landscapes.

Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E

The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E

5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal.

Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E

5|$|Later vestiges {{date from}} the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns {{bordering}} the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns {{that leads to the}} top of the podium. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction.

The chapel was chosen {{out of the}} four to commemorate the then-newly canonised saints {{because it was the}} most thematically similar, in that the martyrs gave up their lives for the faith, emulating Jesus' {{sacrifice}} to save mankind. New stained glass windows were installed depicting the saints.|$|E

By that afternoon, 5th Brigade was well established on the Orsogna to Ortona lateral road and had driven a shallow salient into the German forward defensive line.

5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy {{it takes to}} remove one electron from an atom, the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy.
