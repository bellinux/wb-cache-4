5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>system,</b> which connects {{most large}} office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to Buffalo Bayou. At the Houston Theater District, also in downtown, the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost {{millions of dollars}} of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives and other artifacts. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground.|$|E

5|$|While {{awaiting}} the first delivery of stone, Simson {{noticed that the}} battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve {{a portion of the}} battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>system,</b> installed electric lighting.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the same}} day Haldane ordered US 1/28th Battalion to closely explore the tunnels in their area of operations, {{uncovering}} a number chambers and trapdoors defended by grenades and booby traps. A Company subsequently located another <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> after an American {{was killed by a}} Viet Cong soldier who suddenly appeared out of a large anthill. Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century {{vision of a}} university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive underground <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> {{more than a century}} old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.|$|E

50|$|Mating usually {{occurs in}} period from late January and early March. During this time, coast moles will diverge from their normal solitary lifestyles and begin {{expanding}} their <b>tunnel</b> <b>systems,</b> even venturing into other coast mole <b>tunnel</b> <b>systems</b> {{in attempts to}} find a mating partner. Little is known about their gestation and nursing behavior. Females produce a single litter per year, and maternal care is limited. Coast mole offspring can become reproductively active within nine to ten months of birth.|$|R
5|$|The {{division}}'s {{drive to}} the Rhine River jumped off on 13 March 1945, and carried the division through Merzig from 17 March, to the Rhine by 21 March, and across the Rhine at Oppenheim on 25–26 March. The division was then reassigned to XII Corps. It {{took part in the}} house-to-house reduction of Hanau on 28 March, broke out of the Main River bridgehead, drove through Fulda on 1 April, and helped reduce Meiningen on 5 April. Moving southeast into Austria, the division assisted in the capture of Linz, 5 May. It had changed the direction of its advance, and was moving northeast into Czechoslovakia, across the Vlatava River, when the cease-fire order was received. One day later, the division overran the Gusen concentration camp in conjunction with the 11th Armored Division, liberating it from German forces. There, it discovered that the Germans had used forced labor to carve out an elaborate <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> with underground aircraft production facilities. SS officers at the camp allegedly planned to demolish the tunnels with the prisoners inside, but the movement of the 26th Infantry and 11th Armored Divisions prevented this.|$|E
25|$|The University of Texas at Austin has an {{extensive}} underground <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> that links the buildings on campus. Constructed in the 1930s {{under the supervision}} of creator Carl Eckhardt, then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the university campus. They measure approximately six miles in length. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and guarded by silent alarms. Since the late 1940s, the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a TRIGA nuclear reactor at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus.|$|E

40|$|Background charge rearrangements in {{metallic}} single-electron transistors are modelled in two-level <b>tunnelling</b> <b>systems</b> as a Poisson {{process with}} a scale parameter as only variable. The model explains the recent observation of asymmetric Coulomb blockade peak spacing distributions in metallic single-electron transistors. From the scale parameter we estimate the average {{size of the}} <b>tunnelling</b> <b>systems,</b> their density of states, and the height of their energy barrier. We conclude that the observed background charge rearrangements predominantly {{take place in the}} substrate of the single-electron transistor.

50|$|While moles are {{typically}} found in <b>tunnel</b> <b>systems,</b> the European mole is not exclusively an underground dweller. In {{the spring and}} early summer when the young moles leave their mothers' burrows they must find new territory. This forces them to leave their burrow and they can either make new <b>tunnel</b> <b>systems</b> or enter existing systems. In the summer time, however, they are likely to burrow much more superficially. The superficial burrowing could be {{due in part to the}} soil that is much harder, which makes burrowing a greater challenge.|$|R

25|$|The -long {{complex of}} tunnels at Củ Chi has been {{preserved}} {{by the government}} of Vietnam, and turned into a war memorial park with two different tunnel display sites, Ben Dinh and Ben Duoc. The tunnels are a popular tourist attraction, and visitors are invited to crawl around in the safer parts of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>system.</b> The Ben Duoc site contains part of the original <b>tunnel</b> <b>system,</b> while the Ben Dinh site, closer to Saigon, has tunnel reconstructions and some tunnels have been made larger to accommodate tourists. In both sites low-power lights have been installed in the tunnels to make traveling through them easier, and both sites have displays of the different types of booby traps that were used. Underground conference rooms where campaigns such as the Tết Offensive were planned in 1968 have been restored, and visitors may enjoy a simple meal of food that Viet Cong fighters would have eaten.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the initial}} phase of tunneling, five {{galleries}} had been excavated: Windsor Gallery, King's And Queen's Lines, St. George's Hall, and Cornwallis Chamber.

40|$|In NMR the {{polarisation}} of the Zeeman {{system may}} be routinely probed and manipulated by applying resonant rf pulses. As with spin-½ nuclei, at low temperature the quantum tunnelling states of a methyl rotor are characterised by two energy levels and {{it is interesting to}} consider how these tunnelling states might be probed and manipulated in an analogous way to nuclear spins in NMR. In this paper experimental procedures based on magnetic field-cycling NMR are described where, by irradiating methyl tunnelling sidebands, the polarisations of the methyl <b>tunnelling</b> <b>systems</b> are measured and manipulated in a prescribed fashion. At the heart of the technique is a phenomenon that is closely analogous to dynamic nuclear polarisation and the solid effect where forbidden transitions mediate polarisation transfer between ¹H Zeeman and methyl <b>tunnelling</b> <b>systems.</b> Depending on the irradiated sideband, both positive and negative polarisations of the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>system</b> are achieved, the latter corresponding to population inversion and negative tunnelling temperatures. The transition mechanics are investigated through a series of experiments and a theoretical model is presented that provides good quantitative agreement...|$|R
25|$|While {{allied forces}} thus failed to search and destroy {{significant}} contingents of enemy forces, they {{did manage to}} uncover parts of the NLF’s complex <b>tunnel</b> <b>system</b> where large amounts of Vietcong supplies and documents were found.

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} assessment model, composed by 11 vulnerability factors, is established {{with the introduction}} of the concept of “vulnerability” into the assessment of <b>tunnel</b> support <b>system.</b> Analytic hierarchy process is utilized to divide these 11 factors into human attributes and natural attributes, and define the weight of these factors for the model.

The {{vulnerability assessment}} model was used for evaluating and modifying the haulage tunnel # 3207 of Bo-fang mine panel # 2. The results decreased the vulnerability of the <b>tunnel</b> support <b>system</b> and demonstrated acceptable effects. Furthermore, the results show that the impact of human attributes on <b>tunnel</b> support <b>systems</b> is dramatic under the condition that natural attributes are permanent, and the “vulnerability” is exactly a notable factor to manifest the transformation during this process. The results also indicate that optimizing human attributes can attenuate vulnerability in <b>tunnel</b> support <b>systems.</b> As a result, enhancement of stability of <b>tunnel</b> support <b>systems</b> can be achieved...|$|R
