The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the <b>two</b> <b>front</b> wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E

5|$|After the album's release, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, whilst the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington {{were involved in a}} car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, {{the latter half of the}} German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily and tests showed that Liam had used cocaine. Liam lost <b>two</b> <b>front</b> teeth and kicked a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with an ashtray. Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000. The band finished their tour in March 2003 after returning to those postponed dates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the high}} school section, {{students}} in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 (inclusive) must wear a white short-sleeved shirt with khaki short trousers and white socks, which must cover the ankle. The four metal buttons must be worn on the <b>two</b> <b>front</b> pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either white or black laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear long beige trousers with a beige shirt, similar to the male students in the college section. College girls wear a beige blouse and a beige skirt. The uniform for the college section was retained from the former Hwa Chong Junior College, which was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar (m1) bears {{four main}} crests {{and a smaller}} one between the two crests at the back. An {{additional}} crest (the anterotropid) is present between the <b>two</b> <b>front</b> crests, the anterolophid and the metalophid, in S.alpinus, but not in S.bolligeri. The occlusal pattern of m2 resembles that of m1. S.bolligeri also lacks an anterotropid on m2, but the tooth is not known from Oberdorf. In a worn m2 from Tägernaustrasse, there is a thickened portion in the labial part of the anterolophid, which Prieto interpreted as a remnant of the anterotropid; this led him to identify the Tägernaustrasse population as S. cf. alpinus. Only Oberdorf has yielded the m3 of Seorsumuscardinus. It resembles the m1 and has a short anterotropid, but has more oblique crests. In S.alpinus, the lower molars have two and occasionally three roots. The roots of the m1 of S.bolligeri are not preserved and the m2 has two roots.|$|E

5|$|Despite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, {{each side}} was highly {{suspicious}} of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of Bukovina in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with Germany. After Germany entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, it began negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact. After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented a written proposal for a Soviet entry into the Axis. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if Germany would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but Germany did not respond. As both sides began colliding {{with each other in}} Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in January 1941. Historian Robert Service avows that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was convinced that the overall military strength of the USSR was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should Germany attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a <b>two</b> <b>front</b> war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions. When German soldiers swam across the Bug River to warn the Red Army of an impending attack, they were treated like enemy agents and shot. Some historians believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with Germany. Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from Germany and proceed with his own campaign against Germany to be followed by one against the rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1948, No.23 Squadron was redesignated No. 6 Squadron. The {{unit was}} based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland and {{equipped}} with Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. No 6 Squadron formed part of No.82 Wing, and was {{primarily responsible for}} training aircrews to serve with the wing's <b>two</b> <b>front</b> line units; No.1 and No.2 Squadrons. Its training effort was increased from 1950 when No.1 Squadron was deployed to Malaya as part of Australia's contribution to the Malayan Emergency. During October that year three of No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were deliberately flown through the cloud which resulted from the first British atomic bomb test (Operation Hurricane) {{which took place in}} the Montebello Islands off Western Australian. These aircraft had the role of determining the level of radioactivity caused by the atomic blast, and No.6 Squadron performed similar duties for the subsequent British atomic bomb tests at Maralinga, South Australia. Several Lincolns were so heavily contaminated with radioactivity during these flights that they could not be flown again. The squadron lost three Lincolns in one day on 8 April 1953 when one was written off after its undercarriage collapsed while landing at Amberley and a further two were destroyed when they collided on the ground at Cloncurry, Queensland; no aircrew were injured in these accidents.|$|E

25|$|Three wheeled {{motorcycles}} {{without the}} ability to lean have {{no need to be}} countersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction does not automatically result in a turn in the other direction. This includes sidecar rigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster uses <b>two</b> <b>front</b> wheels which do not lean, and so it steers like a car.|$|E
25|$|Some sidecar rigs {{allow the}} {{motorcycle}} to lean {{independent of the}} sidecar, and in some rigs, the sidecar even leans in parallel with the bike.
