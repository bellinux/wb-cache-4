25|$|The Concordat of 1854 was an {{international}} treaty between Carrera and the Holy See, signed in 1852 and ratified {{by both parties}} in 1854. Through this, Guatemala gave the education of Guatemalan people to regular orders of the Catholic Church, committed to respect ecclesiastical property and monasteries, imposed mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor what {{was published in the}} country; in return, Guatemala received dispensations for the members of the army, allowed those who had acquired the properties that the liberals had expropriated from the Church in 1829 <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> properties, received the taxes generated by the properties of the Church, and had the right to judge certain crimes committed by clergy under Guatemalan law. The concordat was designed by Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and not only reestablished but reinforced the relationship between Church and State in Guatemala. It was in force until the fall of the conservative government of Field Marshal Vicente Cerna y Cerna.|$|E

The singer signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music in 2011, which {{led her to}} write songs for artists like Girls Aloud and Icona Pop. Around that time, she {{was going through a}} hard situation in a relationship, so she eventually started composing tracks related to that matter. She then decided <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> tracks for herself as she considered them too personal. Lo independently released two of the songs as singles, [...] "Love Ballad" [...] in October 2012, and [...] "Habits" [...] in March 2013.

500|$|While the {{revisions}} to the play Blackrock were still being finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to direct a film version, which would also be titled Blackrock. By December 1995, Vidler was working with Enright as an unofficial script editor, although they were having trouble finding financing for the film. Vidler said he considered directing the film Blackrock after having watched and been moved by the theatrical version, saying the play was [...] "absolutely {{what it was like}} [...] growing up in the Western Suburbs... It's about keeping bonded with your mates. Nothing else matters... It's about the unbelievable lengths boys will go <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> bonds solid." [...] Leigh's mother Robyn campaigned to have production of the film halted, but her attempts failed after the film received government financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office.|$|E

However, due to the tighter flow of credit from the banks, total FHA loans in 2009 were four times that of 2006, raising concern that year that if the economy were to dip back into recession, more Fed funds could be required <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> loans afloat. [...] Frank's response was that the additional defaults— 2.2% more of the total portfolio in 2009 than the year before— were worth the economic stabilization of the broader policy, noting [...] "It was an effort to keep prices from falling too fast." [...] In that context, he opined, [...] "I don't think it's a bad thing that the bad loans occurred." [...] In fact, the unprecedented number of loans made since 2008 were noted to be performing far better than those in the prior two years.|$|E
500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times was {{critical}} of the episode, discussing the show's [...] "increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country." [...] He commented that while [...] "Acafellas" [...] did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than [...] "Showmance", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the [...] "most fun of all" [...] in the episode, but overall noted that: [...] "The humor can’t {{make up for the}} lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show {{is always going to be}} how to fill the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are already getting old, so it would behoove the producers <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> gaps as short as possible." [...] Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee [...] "overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot." [...] Ray wrote, Glee [...] "upbeat message" [...] was [...] "overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of-the mill high school drama." [...] As with Hale, Ray commented that: [...] "Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri [...] "beyond annoying", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Of Will, Malcom posed the question: [...] "didn’t it feel as though his commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] How could he turn his back so easily?" [...] More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene [...] "lovely". She wrote that Groban's appearance was [...] "laugh out loud" [...] funny, while Stack commented: [...] "It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom." ...|$|E

Douglas Laycock, law professor at the University of Virginia, said, [...] "The whole secular left has decided" [...] that RFRA laws [...] "are very dangerous because they care so much more about the contraception cases and gay rights." [...] He said RFRA laws are mischaracterized because they do not dictate outcomes favoring religious objectors, they only require courts to use the highest standard of scrutiny on any law challenged. Mark Kernes, Senior Editor and Chief Legal Analyst for AVN magazine stated in an op-ed piece, [...] "If the Hobby Lobby decision supports the 'right' of companies not to make available birth control that will prevent women from 'catching' a pregnancy, what's <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>those</b> same religious companies from arguing that providing access to PrEP drugs like Truvada, which help prevent gays (and, admittedly, everyone) from catching HIV shouldn't similarly be excluded from their health plans?" ...|$|E
