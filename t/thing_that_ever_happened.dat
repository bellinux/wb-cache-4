In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a growth spurt and stood nearly at 6ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court.

500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law. In 2001, during {{the debate on the}} bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, saying that McCain had [...] "bullied" [...] House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E
500|$|In 1956 Curtiss-Wright began isotope {{work at the}} facility, and The New York Times {{published}} {{two stories}} on the new nuclear research laboratory that year, followed by a November 1957 report that the one-megawatt nuclear reactor was completed. In 1958, the corporation received a twenty-year license from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to operate a four-megawatt pool-type nuclear research reactor, and received permission from the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board to dispose of some radioactive waste in Meeker Run, a tributary of Mosquito Creek. The project was billed as [...] "the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in North Central Pennsylvania", and was expected to employ between 7,000 and 8,000 people.

According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her.

Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed {{it up with a}} third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals.

500|$|As {{the series}} ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the {{pregnancy}} of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully {{giving birth to}} an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the series" [...] as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X-Files {{at the end of}} the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing". Anderson was not featured at all in the episode [...] "3", as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time.|$|E
500|$|After several {{stand-alone}} episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials {{early in}} the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through production of the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to the series", noting that the mythology [...] "really ended up running through {{the life of the}} series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant". Although there were initially thoughts about Anderson's character Scully giving birth to an alien child, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X-Files {{at the end of the}} season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, reappearing comatose several episodes later. In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and X (Steven Williams), and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show.|$|E

500|$|Although widely acclaimed, {{the album}} has been censured by some. It was voted the worst record ever {{made in a}} 1998 Melody Maker poll of pop stars, DJs and journalists. Among the harshest detractors was {{musician}} and journalist John Robb, who described the album as [...] "the benchmark of 1967 – the low water point of rock 'n' roll". In a scathing appraisal of the record prior to its 40th anniversary in 2007, Guardian critic Richard Smith wrote that it is [...] "if not the worst, then certainly the most overrated album of all time". He {{also said that the}} [...] "excruciating" [...] LP was often ranked by members of the music press as the best ever due to affection for its cultural impact, and [...] "not because of anything intrinsically great about the record". Asked in 2007 to nominate the [...] "supposedly great" [...] album he would [...] "gladly never hear again", artist and writer Billy Childish named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, saying that it [...] "signalled the death of rock 'n' roll". Musician and author Bill Drummond, in a 2010 publication, called the record [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to music". In 2015, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards denounced the album as [...] "a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like Satanic Majesties".|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
500|$|Humor and irony are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} book. Mark Lawson of The Guardian considered the narrator's tone to be [...] "sardonic empath", and other critics have characterized {{the beginning of the}} novel as comical. When Cal is baptized as an infant by Father Mike, a Greek Orthodox clergyman, the priest receives a surprise: [...] "From between my cherubic legs a stream of crystalline liquid shot into the air ... Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... struck Father Mike {{right in the middle of}} the face." [...] Derek Weiler of the Toronto Star noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the [...] "horrific qualities of public men's rooms". The author employed another writing deviceabrupt incongruityin describing Desdemona's physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her [...] "braids were not delicate like a little girl's but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver's tail". According to Penelope Music of Book Magazine, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from [...] "run-of-the-mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy". An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal's grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that [...] "hameful as it is to say, the riots were the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to us." [...] The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout.|$|E

500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E
