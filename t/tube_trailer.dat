5000|$|As of September 2013, The Linde Group has {{introduced}} a <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> operating at [...] utilizing new, lighter storage materials to {{more than double the}} amount of compressed gaseous hydrogen to 1,100 kg, or a normal [...] of hydrogen gas. The new trailers can be filled and emptied in less than 60 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen <b>tube</b> <b>trailers</b> are {{semi-trailers}} that {{consist of}} 10 to 36 cluster high-pressure hydrogen tanks varying in length from 20 ft for small tubes to 38 ft on jumbo <b>tube</b> <b>trailers.</b> They {{are part of}} the hydrogen highway and usually precede a local hydrogen station.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrogen}} infrastructure consists {{mainly of}} industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those {{found on a}} hydrogen highway. Hydrogen stations which are not situated near a hydrogen pipeline can obtain supply via hydrogen tanks, compressed hydrogen <b>tube</b> <b>trailers,</b> liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{materials}} that are gaseous at ambient temperature and pressure are supplied as compressed gas. A gas compressor is used to compress the gas into storage pressure vessels (such as gas canisters, gas cylinders or <b>tube</b> <b>trailers)</b> through piping systems.

50|$|The {{need for}} a {{hydrogen}} infrastructure varies, where the Yacht No. 1 was fueled by a mobile hydrogen station, the prototype Haveblue Yacht XV 1 was intended to have onboard hydrogen generation, the Xperiance and Tuckerboot have exchangeable high-pressure hydrogen tanks which can be refilled at a local hydrogen station, the canal boat Ross Barlow uses fixed onboard low-pressure solid-state metal hydride storage tanks and depends on a refilling station on the waterside, the Zemships Alsterwasser refills at a fixed waterside storage tank with 17,000 liters of hydrogen which is refuelled by a compressed hydrogen <b>tube</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Risk {{of fatigue}} failure {{exists in the}} <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> {{cylinders}} under the condition of internal pressure variation and inertial load caused through road transport. In order to estimate the safety state of the cylinders under the action of alternating load, the model of certain geometry sizes {{is built based on}} the widely used <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> cylinders. The fatigue analysis of <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> gas cylinders is made aiming at the action of the internal pressure and the inertial load. The fatigue life distribution of cylinders is obtained under the condition of different loads through the numerical simulation by ANSYS Workbench. The analysis results show that under internal pressure, gas cylinders have limited fatigue life, but can satisfy the requirements; when the inertial load exceeds a certain value, natural gas cylinders of <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> is under finite life state, which does not meet the requirements of strength, therefore the inertial load should be controlled...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the unique pneumatic test {{requirements for the}} acoustic and shock separation testing of the Second Stage for the new Delta III Rocket at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The testing was conducted in the 45, 000 cu ft (25 -feet wide by 30 -feet deep by 50 -foot high) Acoustic Facility. The acoustic testing required that the liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tanks be filled with enough liquid nitrogen (LN 2) to simulate launch fuel masses during testing. The challenge for this test dealt with designing, procuring, and fabricating the pneumatic supply systems for quick assembly while maintaining the purity requirements and minimizing costs. The pneumatic systems were designed to fill and drain the both LOX and LH 2 tanks {{as well as to}} operate the fill/drain and vent valves for each of the tanks. The test criteria for the pneumatic sub-systems consisted of function, cleanliness, availability, and cost. The first criteria, function, required the tanks to be filled and drained in an efficient manner while preventing them from seeing pressures greater than 9 psig which would add a pressure cycle to the tank. An LN 2 tanker, borrowed from another NASA facility, served as the pre-cool and drain tanker. Pre-cooling the tanks allowed for more efficient and cost effective transfer from the LN 2 delivery tankers. Helium gas, supplied from a high purity <b>tube</b> <b>trailer,</b> was used to pressurize the vapor space above the LN 2 pushing it into the drain tanker. The <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> also supplied high pressure helium to the vehicle for valve control and component purges. Cleanliness was maintained by proper component selection, end-use particle filtration, and any on-site cleaning determined necessary by testing. In order to meet the availability/cost juggling act, products designed for LOX delivery systems were procured to ensure system compatibility while off the shelf valves and tubing designed for the semiconductor industry were procured for the gas systems...|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen {{stations}} {{which are}} not situated near a hydrogen pipeline get supply via hydrogen tanks, compressed hydrogen <b>tube</b> <b>trailers,</b> liquid hydrogen trailers, liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production. Some firms as ITM Power are also providing solutions {{to make your own}} hydrogen (for use in the car) at home. Government supported activities to expand an hydrogen fuel infrastructure are ongoing in the US state of California, in some member states of the European Union (most notably in Germany) and in particular in Japan.|$|R
40|$|Tube {{trailers}} {{with large}} capacity seamless steel cylinders {{have been used}} more and more widely in China to transport industrial gases. As an authorized <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> inspection organization {{by the government of}} China, China Special Equipment Inspection and Research Institute has carried out periodical inspection of tube trailers in China since 2004. A statistical analysis was done based on 4059 periodical inspection reports of tube trailers from 2004 to 2013, which include 3687 tube trailers and 31627 cylinders. Information of present status of tube trailers in China was obtained, such as annual amounts, usage regions of tube trailers, numbers of cylinders mounted on tube trailers, and specifications, filling mediums, typical flaws of the cylinders. The statistical results show that mounting threads of 16. 16 % of the cylinders were worn seriously, and repair or reprocess work had to be done on these threads. Reasons of the abrasion of the mounting threads were analyzed and discussed by taking into account the usage regions of the tube trailers, the detailed structures of the mounting threads, and the mounting location of cylinders on the tube trailers...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note is {{a collection}} of pipe pressure testing documents for various sections of piping for the D-Zero cryogenic and gas systems. High pressure piping must conform with FESHM chapter 5031. 1. Piping lines with ratings greater than 150 psig have a pressure test done before the line is put into service. These tests require the use of pressure testing permits. It is my intent that all pressure piping over which my group has responsibility conforms to the chapter. This includes the liquid argon and liquid helium and liquid nitrogen cryogenic systems. It also includes the high pressure air system, and the high pressure gas piping of the WAMUS and MDT gas systems. This is not an all inclusive compilation of test documentation. Some piping tests have their own engineering note. Other piping section test permits are included in separate safety review documents. So if it isn't here, that doesn't mean that it wasn't tested. D-Zero has a back up air supply system to add reliability to air compressor systems. The system includes high pressure piping which requires a review per FESHM 5031. 1. The core system consists of a pressurized <b>tube</b> <b>trailer,</b> supply piping into the building and a pressure reducing regulator tied into the air compressor system discharge piping. Air flows from the trailer if the air compressor discharge pressure drops below the regulator setting. The <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> is periodically pumped back up to approximately 2000 psig. A high pressure compressor housed in one of the exterior buildings is used for that purpose. The system was previously documented, tested and reviewed for Run I, except for the recent addition of piping to and from the high pressure compressor. The following documents are provided for review of the system: (1) Instrument air flow schematic, drg. 3740. 000 -ME- 273995 rev. H; (2) Component list for air system; (3) Pressure testing permit for high pressure piping; (4) Documentation from Run I contained in D-Zero Engineering note 3740. 214 -EN- 268, John Urbin 11120 / 90; (5) Pressure test procedure; (6) Schematic for pressure test; and (7) List of component pressure ratings. The goal of this independent review is to: (1) Reviewer makes recommendation to the Division/Section Safety Officer to approve the testing permit; and (2) Reviewer is satisfied the FESHM 5031 is met, and recommends to the division head that approval to operate be granted...|$|E
40|$|The D 0 {{instrument}} air system for cryo controls has an emergency backup supply of nitrogen gas. The backup system {{consists of a}} high pressure <b>tube</b> <b>trailer</b> (38 tubes - 2400 psig MAWP), piping, valves, regulators and pressure monitoring instrumentation. The trailer is located south of DAB alongside the LN{sub 2 } Dewar. Fixed piping ties to the trailer with a flex-hose. The piping follows the cryo piping bridge entering the south wall of DAB. where it passes through the pipe chase and into the cryo pump room (Rm 315). The high pressure gas is regulated down to 90 psig before tying into the compressor supplied {{instrument air}} system. Check valves are installed at the tee for the primary air and the backup N{sub 2 }. Normal operating pressure for instrument air is 100 - 120 psig. With the backup supply pressure set to 90 psig, 'emergency air' is supplied whenever primary air pressure falls below 90 psig. There are two additional, outside connections to the system: one is a connection for repumping the trailer after a minimum backup volume is reached {{and the other is}} an auxiliary flex-hose connection for another trailer. All manual valves at system connections will be locked closed when not in use. The system's maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) is 2400 psi, which is the trailer MAWP. All piping and components have a minimum 2400 psi working pressure. Actual component working pressures are included in the component list...|$|E
5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in <b>tube</b> <b>trailers</b> which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|R
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium <b>tube</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen can be {{produced}} from many feedstocks with different production and delivery pathways. Production options include conversion {{from a variety of}} feedstocks and energy sources. Delivery modes for vehicle fueling include compressed gas in <b>tube</b> <b>trailers</b> and pipelines, liquefied hydrogen in trucks, or on-site production. Alternative carrier options such as chemical hydrides are also being investigated. The energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) were analyzed for different production pathways for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and comparable gasoline fueled vehicles. The results for on-site reforming of natural gas, central plant natural gas reforming, petroleum coke gasification, central plant biomass pyrolysis, and on-site electrolysis using a mix of natural gas based and renewable power are presented in this paper. Well to wheel energy inputs and GHG emissions were determined from primary energy inputs to the fuel cycle using analysis tools developed by TIAX, which account for the contribution of energy from natural gas, biomass, petroleum, and electric power...|$|R
40|$|We have {{assessed}} the transportation of hydrogen as a metal hydride slurry through pipelines over {{a short distance}} from a neighborhood hydrogen production facility to local points of use. The assessment was conducted {{in the context of a}} hydrogen "mini-grid" serving both vehicle fueling and stationary fuel cell power systems for local building heat and power. The concept was compared to a compressed gaseous hydrogen mini-grid option and to a stand-alone hydrogen fueling station. Based on our analysis results we have concluded that the metal hydride slurry concept has potential to provide significant reductions in overall energy use compared to liquid or chemical hydride delivery, but only modest reductions in overall energy use, hydrogen cost, and GHG emissions compared to a compressed gaseous hydrogen delivery. However, given the inherent (and perceived) safety and reasonable cost/efficiency of the metal hydride slurry systems, additional research and analysis is warranted. The concept could potentially overcome the public acceptance barrier associated with the perceptions about hydrogen delivery (including liquid hydrogen tanker trucks and high-pressure gaseous hydrogen pipelines or <b>tube</b> <b>trailers)</b> and facilitate the development of a near-term hydrogen infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Issues {{related to}} global warming have moved {{hydrogen}} into the spotlight as a promising energy carrier. As hydrogen is considered as a promising energy carrier from concerns driven by global warming, {{the goal of this}} work was a development and optimization of an integrated modelling and optimization of hydrogen energy network for Texas. To achieve such goal, the hydrogen energy network formulation based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) was performed. In the hydrogen energy network, five raw materials and three electricity potential sources were introduced, and they highly affected on the technology availability when they are depleted. Hydrogen was produced from technologies such as SMR, coal and biomass gasification, and alkaline/PEM/solid oxide electrolysis. The produced hydrogen was compressed or liquefied to be ready for use. The produced hydrogen was sold at $ 5 /kg, and could be transported from one region to other through <b>tube</b> <b>trailers,</b> tanker trucks, <b>tube</b> railcars, and tank railcars to maximize the profit and meet hydrogen demand. Lastly, some possible scenarios were tested such as discounting electricity price scenarios and limiting raw material availability. When electricity price was reduced, there were technology transitions from SMR to the electrolysis at some geographical regions. Additionally, the electricity price discount triggered an increase in hydrogen autonomy of each geographical region as it decreased the amount of hydrogen transported. When the fossil fuel based raw material availability was gradually reduced over time period according to Horizon 2020, there were increased raw material transportations as the raw materials depleted faster in some geographical regions at certain time periods. The combined scenarios regarding both electricity price and raw material limitation were also tested, and it showed the competence of two technologies, biomass gasification and solid oxide electrolysis, as both required natural gas which was limited...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cars were}} {{initially}} {{used on the}} Piccadilly <b>tube.</b> The <b>trailer</b> cars were numbered 800-819, the converted motor cars were 480-499, and the control trailers were initially 700-719, but were renumbered to 1700-1719 in 1926. The trailers became 1316-1335 and the control trailers 2043-2062 in 1930, and in 1934, following the formation of London Transport {{and the introduction of}} a standard numbering scheme, the trailers became 7230-7249, while the control trailers were given the numbers 5170-5189. The cars were considered to be drab, when compared with new stock being delivered to the Hampstead Line around 1930, and they were refurbished. [...] As built the cars had longitudinal seating through the length of the car, providing seats for 44 passengers. As part of the refurbishment, the central bay was fitted with transverse seats, increasing the capacity to 48, and armrests were fitted to the remaining seats. The cement floors were replaced by wooden slat flooring, and the lighting was improved. Changes were also made to the couplers between the cars, and the air-doors on the driving cabs of the control trailers were replaced by swing doors. The 1906 motor cars were withdrawn, and the trains were completed by the addition of Standard Stock motor cars, built by the Metropolitan Carriage & Wagon Company in 1927. At the time, the Piccadilly line was being extended, with the extensions involving open-air running, and the 1920 stock was unsuitable for use in wet conditions. It was therefore transferred to the Bakerloo line between January and October 1932. Following the introduction of the 1929/30 batch of Standard Stock, which was the first to be fitted with electro-pneumatic brakes, a decision was taken to convert all of the Standard Stock to use this system. Most had been fitted with the new equipment by 1936, but the exceptions were the motor cars running with the 1920 stock. These were not converted until 1938 when the 1920 stock was withdrawn from passenger service.|$|R
