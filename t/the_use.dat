40|$|The Study On <b>The</b> <b>Used</b> Rice as Staple Food. Background: Due to {{the high}} price of rice, some people <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice known as "beras aking" as staple food {{replacing}} the rice. The rice was cooked similar to the cooking of original rice. In its preparation to become aking, the cooked rice firstly is dried under the sun until the rice becoming dry. Consequently, the appearance of the rice is brownness color and sometime already grown by the mold. However, the people are preferred to choose the aking than other alternate food such as cassava. Therefore we performed to study the nutrition and acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice through <b>the</b> chemical analysis, microbial observation and sensory evaluation of <b>the</b> cooked of <b>used</b> rice. Objectives: <b>The</b> objective {{of this study is to}} asses <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> rice as staple food. Methods: Five samples of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice were obtained from district of Cirebon, Sumedang, Cileles, Indramayu and Bandung. The method of study is descriptive method to examine <b>the</b> characteristic of <b>used</b> rice by comparing with the ordinary rice. Results: As the consequent in preparation of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice, its content of moisture, pH, density and whiteness were low than those of ordinary rice. In addition, the content of reducing sugar was a bit higher than these of original rice. However, the protein content of <b>used</b> rice showed <b>the</b> various result, two samples of them had protein content less than the usual rice 2 ̆ 7 s while the rest three samples had protetn content higher than the ordinary rice 2 ̆ 7 s. The content of ash and total count of microbial in <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice was seemly not different from the usual rice 2 ̆ 7 s However, the growth of microbial during preparation of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice was observed. Therefore, the examination of toxic substance should be done. The color, texture and aroma of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice were assessed lower than those of the ordinary rice in descriptive analysts. <b>The</b> steamed <b>used</b> rice had brownish white color, very soft texture and enough annoying acid aroma. Conclusion: <b>The</b> quality of <b>used</b> rice could be increased both nutritionally and its acceptance. Mixing <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice with other ingredient and the more controlled drying process and good raw material would increase the quality of <b>the</b> <b>used</b> rice.
