5|$|Simpson {{announced}} that he would not ride the Tour de France, concentrating on the world road championships instead. Before, he won the Isle of Man International in treacherous conditions where only sixteen out of seventy riders finished. At the road world championships in Ronse, Belgium, the Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: Henry Anglade (France) and Seamus Elliott (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson. They were caught; the race finished in a bunch sprint, with Simpson crossing the line in 29th. Simpson's season ended with six-day races across Europe and an invitation only race on the Pacific island of New Caledonia, along with other European riders. He skipped his usual winter training schedule for his first skiing holiday at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains in the Alps, taking Helen and his <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters,</b> Jane and Joanne.|$|E

5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters.</b> Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E

5|$|When Baldwin {{arrived at}} Acre on 12 October 1190, the Muslim {{forces in the}} city were under siege by the Frankish forces led by King Guy of Lusignan and Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem, who in turn were being besieged by Saladin. Soon after Baldwin's arrival, there was a {{succession}} crisis in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Sibylla, a first cousin of Henry II, and her <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters</b> all died in July from an epidemic ravaging the siege camp where they were living. This left Guy without a legal claim to the kingdom as he had held the kingship through his wife. The heiress to the kingdom was Sibylla's half-sister Isabella; she was already married to Humphrey IV of Toron, but he was loyal to Guy and {{seems to have had}} no ambition to be king. A more promising candidate for the throne was Conrad of Montferrat, uncle of the last undisputed king, Baldwin V. Conrad had saved the kingdom from destruction by leading the successful defence of Tyre, and had the support of Isabella's mother Maria Comnena and stepfather Balian of Ibelin. Maria and Balian abducted Isabella from Humphrey, and compelled her to seek an annulment, so that she could be married to Conrad and enable him to claim the kingship.|$|E

In the years to come, her prominence would overshadow Rushmore's shrinking repute, her success a cause of envy that would result in unending domestic friction. But in 1945, Rushmore was still {{at the peak of his}} career. Later that year, after obtaining a Mexican divorce from Ruth Rushmore, he married McCoy in a Bridgeport, Connecticut ceremony. Ruth Rushmore tried to have Howard arrested—her lawyer would later maintain that the Mexican divorce was invalid and that Howard Rushmore was a bigamist.|$|E

500|$|Lundgren started researching human {{trafficking}} in 2005.

He started developing Skin Trade in 2007, after reading a news report {{about a group of}} girls being smuggled into the United States from Mexico. The girls were left in a vehicle along the border; trapped inside and with no means of escape, they all died of heat stroke and suffocation. Lundgren, who had <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters</b> at the time, felt the story of human trafficking [...] "had to be told".

500|$|The {{songs for}} Frozen were written and {{composed}} by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, {{both of whom}} had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh (2011) (also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo– The Musical (2007). Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters).</b> Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent. The decision, of course, was easy: [...] "Whenever Disney asks {{if you want to}} do a fairy tale musical, you say yes." ...|$|E

Lady Russell wrote that George and Anne had [...] "taken [...] very heavily. The first relief of that sorrow proceeded from the threatening of a greater, the Prince being so ill of a fever. I never heard any relation more moving than that of seeing them together. Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined."

500|$|At Cape Smythe {{two more}} Inuit hunters, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the expedition, {{together}} with Keraluk's family—wife Keruk and their <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters</b> Helen and Mugpi. As the voyage proceeded, Bartlett became increasingly {{anxious about the}} extent of ice in the area, and noted that the brass stemplates on the ship's bow had already been damaged. Over the next few days Karluk struggled to make headway, as Bartlett took the ship northwards away from the coast, following channels of open water. The only scientific tasks of substance that could be carried out during this period were Murray's dredging operations, through which he collected many species of Arctic sea life, and the regular depth soundings. On 13 August Bartlett calculated their position as [...] east of Point Barrow, with a similar distance to travel to Herschel Island. This proved to be the ship's farthest point east, as at that position she became firmly trapped in the ice and began to move slowly westward; by 10 September Karluk had retreated nearly [...] back towards Point Barrow. Shortly afterwards, Stefansson informed Bartlett that all hopes for further progress that year had ended, and that Karluk would have to winter in the ice.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{screenplay}} {{was constantly}} being revised and re-written. Naturally, so was Mulan's characterization and {{role in the}} film.

[...] Between the two, Bancroft and his twin brother Tom, an animator who also worked on Mulan, have a total of seven daughters. This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is [...] "not another damsel in distress" [...] in favor of having her resemble [...] "a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story" [...] instead, essentially a [...] "female role model. The characteristics of strength and courage were a must for Mulan." [...] In an interview with The Christian Post, Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he, as the film's director, continued to consider the well-being of his <b>two</b> <b>young</b> <b>daughters</b> while working on Mulan, having [...] "wanted to make... a unique heroine that hadn't been seen before" [...] and provide for them [...] "someone who would be strong on her own, without a prince saving her." [...] Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses, Bancroft explained, [...] "Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change. Mulan stays consistent. From the first frame {{all the way through the}} end of the movie, her personality, her drive it all stays the same." ...|$|E
