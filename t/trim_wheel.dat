50|$|Direct law (DIR) {{introduces}} a direct stick-to-control surfaces relationship: control surface motion {{is directly related}} to the sidestick and rudder pedal motion. The trimmable horizontal stabilizer can only be controlled by the manual <b>trim</b> <b>wheel.</b> All protections are lost, and the maximum deflection of the elevators is limited for each configuration as a function of the current aircraft centre of gravity. This aims to create a compromise between adequate pitch control with a forward C.G. and not-too-sensitive control with an aft C.G.|$|E

50|$|The Argenta {{was closely}} {{based on its}} {{predecessor}} Fiat 132. All body panels and windows except the doors were new. Other changes included new <b>trim,</b> <b>wheels,</b> dashboard, mirrors and rectangular headlights. Trim level was raised compared to the previous 132 and the contemporary 131 Mirafiori, with power steering, electric windows and door locking. Some markets had a large manually-sliding steel sunroof, others had air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|Available {{with the}} 1093 cc engine the Coupé {{featured}} additions such as sporting seats <b>trim,</b> <b>wheel</b> arch extensions, rear spoiler, low profile tyres and a rev counter, {{as well as}} the round headlights which were later fitted across the range. The GL featured a 60 PS (44 kW) engine. In 1985, the first sporty Polo, the Coupé GT, was introduced with a 75 PS (55 kW) engine, as well as servo assisted brakes, twin headlights, a digital clock, sports seats and a rev counter. Other special feature models were introduced over the rest of the period of the Mark 2 production run including models such as the Twist, Parade and Country.|$|E
50|$|In some markets {{secondary}} badging may denote {{engine size}} and variations such as <b>trim,</b> <b>wheel,</b> and other options. These badges include GS, GT, SE and FX, although some use FX {{across the entire}} range available. In certain markets, certain exterior colors are not available and identification may require noticing subtle local differences such as alloy wheels, spoilers or dealer fit options such as in car entertainment systems. These can all change {{from year to year}} and from market to market, so the variation is quite significant. One notable difference is that the 1.6 engine always has a single exhaust on the right hand side, in all markets where it is sold.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} {{flight was}} the first flight after maintenance personnel replaced the forward elevator trim cable. When the flightcrew received the airplane, the captain {{did not address the}} recent cable change noted on his maintenance release. The captain also did not perform a first flight of the day checklist, which included an elevator trim check. Shortly after takeoff, the flightcrew reported a runway (sic) trim, and manually selected nose-up trim. However, the elevator trim then traveled to the full nose-down position. The control column forces subsequently increased to 250 pounds, and the flightcrew was unable to maintain control of the airplane. During the replacement of the cable, the maintenance personnel skipped a step in the manufacturer's airliner maintenance manual (AMM). They did not use a lead wire to assist with cable orientation. In addition, the AMM incorrectly depicted the elevator trim drum, and the depiction of the orientation of the cable around the drum was ambiguous. The maintenance personnel stated that they had completed an operational check of the airplane after maintenance. The Safety Board performed a mis-rigging demonstration on an exemplar airplane, which reversed the elevator trim system. An operational check on that airplane revealed that when the electric trim motor was activated in one direction, the elevator trim tabs moved in the correct direction, but the <b>trim</b> <b>wheel</b> moved opposite of the corresponding correct direction. When the manual <b>trim</b> <b>wheel</b> was moved in one direction, the elevator trim tabs moved opposite of the corresponding correct direction. NTSB ...|$|E

50|$|Ferrari {{has built}} 30, adding one special edition to the 29 that were {{originally}} planned. The original 29 {{have all been}} sold to pre-selected past Ferrari customers. The 30th was retained by Ferrari S.p.A. and presented to Ferrari's F1 World Champion driver, Michael Schumacher, when he retired from Formula One racing {{at the end of}} 2006. Schumacher's FXX differs from others in being black without a stripe, having red <b>trimmed</b> <b>wheels,</b> matte rather than chrome exhaust tips, and his personal logo stitched on the racing seats.|$|R
50|$|LS6-c:major redesign, {{the most}} {{important}} novelty being the interchangeable wing tips allowing a span extension to 17.5 metres. This longer span required a larger rudder, increasing the overall length by eighteen centimetres. Concurrently, the cockpit was reinforced for increased crash safety and the allowable weight of non-lifting parts was increased. At {{the same time the}} control and ballast systems were brought up to a new standard shared with the LS7: fully automatic control hook-ups, a mass-balanced flaperon drive system (previous versions having anti-flutter dampers), airbrake locks relocated in the wings, a trigger-activated trim system in place of the <b>trim</b> <b>wheel,</b> a new ballast system that did away with plumbing inside the fuselage and Mylar seals for all control surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1989, the 4x4 sport {{appearance}} package included black bumper {{and body}} <b>trim,</b> <b>wheel</b> flares, mirrors, sport grille, 16-inch cast-aluminum wheels and special [...] "4x4" [...] badging {{on the box}} and [...] "SPORT" [...] badged on the tailgate. The box and tailgate decals were flanked by red-outlined Chevy bow ties. The sport package was only offered from 1989 until 1992 as some insurance companies began to express concerns {{with the idea of}} a high-performance truck. RPO code was BYP. This model was only available with the standard cab and regular fleet-side box. Colors included white, black, and red. The Work Truck (W/T) was also introduced in 1990, which featured a single-cab long bed with Cheyenne trim and new grille with black bumpers. Also in 1988 the GMC 3500 EFI with a 454 (7.4 L) was available. The 454 EFI produced [...] and 385 lbft Nm. In 1991, the 4L80-E automatic transmission was available for the 3/4-ton and one-ton trucks. In 1992, the four-speed manual transmission was dropped and the stepside trucks were available with extended cabs. The 6.5-liter diesel V8 was also made available with a turbocharger. In 1989, a Sport package was available for the fleet side short-bed Chevrolet trucks, featuring body-colored, striped molding, body-colored bumpers, and a blacked-out grille with chrome-plated steel wheels and specialized chromed plastic center caps. The Sport package also included a standard Chevrolet Receiver hitch and stiffer rear suspension, as well as oil and transmission cooling lines and heftier brake package. Of the first 1989 Silverado sport trucks there were only 5,400 produced. The Sport was re-introduced in 1990, this time with composite headlights and different sport emblems on the bedsides. This is one of the most frequently faked looks for the Chevrolet trucks but VIN decoding will reveal if it is a true [...] "sport" [...] or not. 1994 models received a new front fascia, federally mandated CHMSL, many new exterior colors including a new two-tone option on the rocker panels, and new tire and wheel combinations. In 1993 all 1500 series and 2500 series two-wheel drive trucks were assembled with the newer 4L60E transmission and the 700 R4 was no longer used at this point. Exterior changes this year included a special two-tone paint job, available in many different varieties new gloss black folding exterior mirrors, and the door handles were changed from a smooth gloss black finish to a textured, satin finish. All 1995 models received a new interior that included a new steering wheel containing a driver's-side airbag, a new dashboard containing a more central-mounted radio, dial-operated HVAC system and an improved gauge cluster. New front door panels, and new seating were also included. In 1996, a passenger-side-mounted third door was optional on extended cab models. A new range of engines was included. The [...] "Vortec" [...] engines meant HP increases across gasoline V6 and V8 small-block engines. The 6.2 diesel V8 was dropped.|$|E

I cut to fine pitch, anticipating a boring lonely wait over Bertrix-Acremont. I’m doing about 340 IAS as I come in from southwest of the field. Hey, there’s a bogey diving in west at about 4 km – probably friendly. I lose him in the clouds as I swing left to take up orbit. 2 seconds later I spot a 109 arcing in on my six from the west, co-alt. Well well, who’d a thunk!

40|$|Among {{all types}} of steels, {{austenitic}} stainless steel, mostly known for its formability and corrosion resistance, has found its utility in diverse field of applications including pipelines, automobile engine and gear parts. ISO/TR 15510 X 12 CrMnNiN 17 - 7 - 5 is a special grade of austenitic stainless steel which was developed to conserve Ni. This non-conventional stainless steel is used in automobile parts such as automotive <b>trim,</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, conveyor belts and railway train bodies etc. In most of these applications, components go through cyclic loading resulting in low cycle fatigue failure. In general, any deformation in metallic systems is controlled by its internal sub-structural variations (dislocation density) {{and so it is}} essential to study sub-structural changes in austenitic stainless steel under cyclic loading. Further, {{it is well known that}} austenite in stainless steel is metastable upon monotonic and cyclic deformation. In this investigation, strain induced transformation of austenite to martensitic using X-Ray diffraction profile analysis has been studied and volume fraction of martensitic and austenitic phases in cyclically deformed specimens under various constant strain amplitudes has been calculated. In order to calculate the dislocation densities and dislocation character in the specimens subjected to cyclic loading under various constant strain amplitudes X-ray diffraction profile analysis using the modified Williamson–Hall equation has been carried out. Estimation of dislocation density has also been done using variation in hardness values of deformed specimens subjected to varying loads incorporating the model of indentation size effect and compared with that of XRD profile analysis. It has been found that dislocation density increases with increase in strain amplitude which implies that non-conventional austenitic stainless steel is cyclically harden able material...|$|E
