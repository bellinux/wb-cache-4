40|$|The {{study of}} {{mandatory}} insurance systems may {{be carried out}} on two different levels. On the one hand, {{it is possible to}} analyze <b>theoretical</b> <b>relations</b> between some properties or elements belonging to that class of systems. On the other, given a set of relevant conditions (which determines a particular structure of transaction costs), empirical outcomes of individual systems can be foreseen. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>relations</b> are instrumentally useful in that process. However, although the mandatory purchase of liability insurance is the property or element which characterizes that kind of systems, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>relations</b> derived only from that property or element are not enough to judge the merits of each individual mandatory insurance system as a whole. Furthermore, from a purely theoretical viewpoint, the duty of insuring brings about fewer consequences than those frequently attributed to such system's element. For example, neither a significant rise in the amount of insured cars, nor internalization of third party losses, nor lesser delay in paying victims compensations must necessarily follow from that isolated duty. Therefore, it is much more accurate to relate some of those effects to other characteristics of the systems, finer-grained than the legal obligation of contracting insurance coverage. Moreover, associating the duty of insuring with some empirical outcomes in the oversimplified way referred to above, has often been used as one of the arguments to support or reject some public policies of car accident control, which would introduce, at least, some vagueness or inaccuracy. This work studies a few <b>theoretical</b> <b>relations</b> between some fine-grained elements of mandatory insurance systems underlying the obligation to purchase coverage, from a transaction costs perspective. We conclude that, in relation to a set of empirical conditions typically related to developing societies, it is possible to find relatively preferable an individual system including that kind of obligation. However, this statement does not mean that every individual systems imposing mandatory insurance are adequate for that type of real realms, or that the duty of insuring should be discarded for societies of a different kind...|$|R
50|$|Nuclear {{reaction}} kinematics are customarily {{performed in}} units involving the electron volt, {{a consequence of}} accelerator technology. The combination of this practical point with the <b>theoretical</b> <b>relation</b> E = mc2 makes units of mega electron volts over {{the speed of light}} squared (MeV/c2) a convenient form to express nuclear mass. However, the numerical values of nuclear masses in MeV/c2 are quite large (even the proton mass is ~938.27 MeV/c2), while mass excesses range in the tens of MeV/c2. This makes tabulated mass excess less cumbersome for use in calculations. One trivial point worth noting is that the 1/c2 term is typically omitted when quoting mass excess values in MeV, since the interest is more often energy and not mass; if one wanted units of mass, one would simply change the units from MeV to MeV/c2 without altering the numerical value.|$|E
50|$|Cronbach's alpha {{also has}} a <b>theoretical</b> <b>relation</b> with factor analysis. As shown by Zinbarg, Revelle, Yovel and Li, alpha may be {{expressed}} {{as a function of}} the parameters of the hierarchical factor analysis model which allows for a general factor that is common to all of the items of a measure in addition to group factors that are common to some but not all of the items of a measure. Alpha may be seen to be quite complexly determined from this perspective. That is, alpha is sensitive not only to general factor saturation in a scale but also to group factor saturation and even to variance in the scale scores arising from variability in the factor loadings. Coefficient Ωhierarchical has a much more straightforward interpretation as the proportion of observed variance in the scale scores that is due to the general factor common to all of the items comprising the scale.|$|E
5000|$|In Pauling's lab, Kuhn {{was trying}} to {{understand}} the color of polyenes by describing π-electrons as particles in a box and he was greatly disappointed - it did not work. Later, when applying the model to cyanine dyes he observed a quantitative agreement with experiment. Today the model is called free electron model (FEMO). He saw the reason why he had failed in polyenes: an instability when assuming equal bonds leads to an alternation between single- and double-bonds caused bythe condition of self-consistency between bond length and π-electron density distribution. He justified this assumption by finding agreement between measured and theoretically predicted absorption spectra. Later this assumption was theoretically verified. [...] This effect is often called Peierls instability: starting from a linear chain of equally spaced atoms Peierls considered first order perturbation theory with Bloch wave functions showing the instability, but he did not consider the self-consistency resulting in the transition to alternation of single and double bonds. The particular properties of conducting polymers are based on the <b>theoretical</b> <b>relation</b> between bond alternation and equalization. The FEMO and its improvements led to a theory on the light absorption of organic dyes. In Marburg, shortly before the age of digital computers, Kuhn and Fritz Peter Schäfer developed an analogue computer to solve the 2-dimensional Schrödinger equation. This room-filling analogue computer was applied by Kuhn's research group to calculate bond lengths in π-electron systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of hydrogen oxidation on a platinum-loaded gas-diffusion electrode has been investigated. Experimental potential–current curves, {{especially in the}} low overpotential range, have been measured for H 2 –N 2 mixtures with a small content of hydrogen and for pure H 2. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>relations</b> have also been presented. Comparing the experimental and <b>theoretical</b> <b>relations,</b> it is concluded that the hydrogen oxidation occurs according to the Volmer–Tafel mechanism. The reactivity of the electrode has a large effect on the kinetic parameters for hydrogen oxidation. The limiting current is determined by diffusion of hydrogen for a very reactive gas diffusion electrode and by the Tafel reaction for a gas diffusion electrode with a low reactivity. The transfer coefficient for the Volmer reaction V is 0. 5 and i 0,V/i 0,T 0. 1 for a very reactive gas diffusion electrode.
