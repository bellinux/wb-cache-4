40|$|Abstract: Construction {{is one of}} the world’s biggest {{industry}} that includes jobs as diverse as build-ing, civil engineering, demolition, renovation, repair and maintenance. Construction workers are exposed {{to a wide variety of}} hazards. This study analyzes 1, 117 expert witness reports which were submitted to criminal and labour courts. These reports are from all regions of the country and cover the period 1972 – 2008. Accidents were classified by the consequence of the incident, time and main causes of the accident, construction type, occupation of the victim, activity at time of <b>the</b> ac-cident and <b>party</b> responsible for <b>the</b> accident. Falls (54. 1 %), struck by thrown/falling object (12. 9 %), structural collapses (9. 9 %) and electrocutions (7. 5 %) rank first four places. The accidents were most likely between the hours 15 : 00 and 17 : 00 (22. 6 %), 10 : 00 – 12 : 00 (18. 7 %) and just after the lunchtime (9. 9 %). Additionally, the most common accidents were further divided into sub-types. Expert-witness assessments were used to identify <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> and what acts of negligence typically lead to accidents. Nearly two thirds of the faulty and negligent acts are carried out by the employers and employees are responsible for almost one third of all cases...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the names}} {{mentioned}} by ”a purifier,” in his communication of Friday last, as objectionable appointments of the Custom House, {{was that of}} Mr. Bagley, who has since called on us, and by whose request we have made more particular inquiries into the charges made against him. On Monday we told Mr. Bagley {{that we could not}} feel justified in withdrawing the general charge against him, for though in the particular cases mentioned we had not been satisfied that he was <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault,</b> yet the general character we heard was against him. To this Mr. Bagley urged that our informants were all enemies of his, which, in one sense of the word, is true, though they are not the persons he supposes. At our last interview with Mr. B. we told him that if he could bring some respectable persons, known to us, who would vouch for him, and explain away what had been told to us, we would take pleasure in saying as much in our paper.Several such have called on us, but whilst they are unanimous in saying that Bagley behaves himself very well at present, yet when we ask them, for instance, about the fight with Casey, they cannot explain satisfactorily. Our impression at the time was, that in the Casey fight Bagley was the aggressor. It does not matter how bad a man Casey had been, nor how much benefit it might be to the public to have him out of the way, we cannot accord to any one citizen the right to kill, or even beat him, without personal provocation. The fact that Casey has been an inmate of Sing Sing prison in New York, is no offence against the laws of this State; nor is the fact of his having stuffed himself through the ballot box as elected to the Board of Supervisors from a district where it is said he was not even a candidate, any justification for Mr. Bagley to shoot Casey, however richly the latter may deserve to have his neck stretched for such fraud on the people. These are acts against the public good, not against Mr. Bagley in particular, and however much we may detest Casey’s former character, or to be convinced of the shallowness of his promised reformation, we cannot justify the assumption by Mr. Bagley to take upon himself the redressing of these wrongs. This case of Bagley’s has caused us much anxiety, and we should have been pleased to have withdrawn cheerfully his name from the list alluded to, but we cannot conscientiously do more than express our gratification at the assurances we get of his present conduct, in which we trust he will persevere. As to Casey fight, we suggest to Mr. Bagley if he can explain that away, it would not be amiss to do so, and he can have the use of our columns for that purpose. [...] There remains historical controversy about the vigilance movements. For example, both Charles Cora and James Casey were hanged in 1856 as murderers by the Committee of Vigilance: Cora shot and killed a U.S. Marshal William H. Richardson who had drunkenly insulted Cora's mistress, Belle Cora, and Casey killed James King, editor of rival newspaper The Evening Bulletin, for publishing an editorial that exposed Casey's criminal record in New York.|$|E
5000|$|Feiglin details {{every step}} of the movement, {{including}} both its formation and activities, as well as the response by the Israeli political and media establishments, in his book במקום שאין אנשים (trans. Where There are No Men). Feiglin and Sackett engaged {{in a wide variety of}} acts of non-violent civil disobedience, especially blocking roads, but also including such activities as handcuffing themselves in place during a talk by then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and proceeding to heckle Rabin before an audience of foreign officials and dignitaries. Feiglin explicitly drew on the philosophies of Western liberal political theory and non-violent civil disobedience, and Sackett drew on his experience of non-violent protest in the United States on behalf of Soviet Jewry. According to Political Science Lecturer Re'aya (Ra'issa) Epstein, This book by Moshe Feiglin, a rank-and-file Israeli Jew, will eventually find it's sic way to its way to well-earned position as one of the earliest intellectual sources instrumental in the creation of a liberal democracy in Israel whose roots lie deep in Jewish foundations and wich sic does not feel required to contest themFeiglin often quotes chapter 10 of The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupéry:"Sire--over what do you rule?""Over everything", said the king, with magnificent simplicity."Over everything?"The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars."Over all that?" [...] asked the little prince."Over all that", the king answered.For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal."And the stars obey you?""Certainly they do", the king said. [...] "They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.""I should like to see a sunset [...] [...] [...] Do me that kindness [...] [...] [...] Order the sun to set [...] [...] [...]""If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" [...] the king demanded. [...] "The general, or myself?""You", said the little prince firmly."Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform", the king went on. [...] "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."Feiglin explains thatIt is a mistake to think that the state works within the boundaries of laws. The public does not obey laws. It obeys rules within the boundaries of a triangle, the first side of which is the law. But the triangle has two other sides: common sense and ethics.What if the Knesset passed a law requiring drivers to drive in reverse all winter? That would counter the logic side of the triangle. The public's subsequent refusal would be the fault of the government, not of the public.In other words, the fact that we obey the law is not because of the law itself, but because it is logical enough to warrant our adherence.The third side of the triangle is ethics. If the government ordered us to drive our elderly and infirm out onto the frozen tundra, as per Eskimo custom, we might agree that it would logically enhance the economy. But nobody would obey, because it would be patently immoral. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for the insubordination would be the government that enacted the law and not the citizens who refused to obey....The greatest crimes in human history were perpetrated when citizens ignored their duty to delineate logical and ethical boundaries for the rule of law. The societies in which this took place by and large collapsed."Good men must not obey the laws too well", said Ralph Waldo Emerson. He understood what the disengaging Israeli tyranny no longer wants to hear....In the past few weeks, soldiers from two separate units in the IDF expressed their civic responsibility by refusing to obey orders to expel Jews from their homes. These brave young men are positioned to save Israel from collapse.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{remediation}} statutes addressing contamination to {{real property}} often require {{the property owner}} to bear liability {{for the cost of}} pollution remediation, irrespective of whether that owner was <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b> Interpretation of these statutory regimes is often complicated when dealing with landlord-tenant-subtenant relationships. This article examines how New York state courts and federal courts sitting in New York have allocated environmental liability between landlord, tenant and subtenant. Specifically, the authors analyze allocation of environmental risk under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the New York Oil Spill Act, and New York City Local Law 76. Examination of case law arising under these statutory regimes reveals that courts generally will hold liable <b>the</b> <b>party</b> with <b>the</b> power to control the leased property, and although an owner landlord may have to bear liability for the cost of remediation, he may have remedies against <b>the</b> <b>party</b> actually <b>at</b> <b>fault,</b> i. e. the tenant or subtenant, through either actions based on statutory contribution or contractual indemnification...|$|R

The PPA may also allow the buyer to curtail energy in circumstances where the after-tax value of electricity changes.When energy is curtailed, it is usually because one of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> involved was <b>at</b> <b>fault,</b> which results in paid damages to <b>the</b> other <b>party.</b> This may be excused in extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> responsible for repairing the project is liable for such damages.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} arbitration for resolving disputes about price formulae in contracts regarding long-term gas supply agreements. Arbitration is preferred because it results in binding awards enforceable under the New York Convention. However, arbitrators frequently treat the dispute as adversarial and put significant weight on the technical language of reopener clauses. A {{closer look at the}} nature of gas price disputes and their contractual underpinnings suggests that standard arbitral process and values are inappropriate. Reopener clauses are tools of co-operation designed to preserve the original bargain {{over a long period of}} time. They are typically drafted in a context of significant uncertainty about future economic trends and neither of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> are <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> for failing to agree how to apply their contract to the facts surrounding a price review. Another process is needed which emphasises the distinctive nature of gas price arbitration. A possible solution arises in the form of "conciliation-arbitration". Conciliation-arbitration is a process where arbitrators deliberately attempt to encourage settlement through informal evaluation of the dispute, and only use standard adversarial processes if parties still fail to reach settlement. Conciliation-arbitration poses nominal ethical risks that are managed by giving <b>parties</b> <b>the</b> power to opt out at the end of the conciliatory stage. Not every arbitral regime will permit use of this process but the decision should be one for <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> to make...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bicycles to {{cars on the road}} remains low in the United States, it is on an upward trend. The high cost of gasoline and the re-introduction of bicycles as an attractive way to commute have contributed to an increase in ridership nationwide. However, as the number of bicycles on the road grows, so do the associated challenges. Without a clear understanding of how these two parties interact in a road network it is possible that we may stunt the growth of this sustainable and beneficial form of transportation and endanger riders through car-centered design practices and an unwillingness to accommodate for cyclists and their needs on the road. Five years of bicycle crash data from the city of San Francisco were analyzed. Using multinomial logistic regression, it is possible to relate different factors to the likelihood of an accident occurring, the corresponding severity, and <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b> Through this statistical analysis the study hopes to determine some of the statistically significant contributing factors to accidents involving cyclists in the city of San Francisco and make recommendations on how planners and design professionals can keep bicyclist safety considerations in mind.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, many studies have {{evaluated}} the effects of automobile or road safety conditions on driver behavior. The focus of most of these investigations has been the 2 ̆ 7 offsetting behavior 2 ̆ 7 (or 2 ̆ 7 risk compensation 2 ̆ 7) hypothesis, which predicts that drivers offset exogenous improvements in safety conditions by driving less safely. Generally, these studies have attempted to measure {{the degree to which}} this offsetting response might (or might not) negate the effect of mandated safety improvements in automobiles. Although the empirical evidence is not uniform, most analyses suggest that the net effect of the regulations on overall highway safety is positive, but less than predicted by traffic safety engineers (whose estimates do not allow for the behavioral modifications by drivers). Also, empirical evidence indicates that non-beneficiaries of automobile safety regulations, such as pedestrians, motor­ cyclists, and bicyclists are at greater risk. This paper extends the discussion of compensating behavior by evaluating the effects of such behavior on accident costs. In particular, I evaluate how exogenous changes in the safety level of the driving environment (road conditions, weather, etc.) affect the relative losses suffered by <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault</b> and other involved parties. In so doing, the analysis augments previous studies by evaluating the influence of offsetting driver behavior on the distribution of accident costs among victims. The estimates presented here lend support to the hypothesis that improvements in the safety level of driving conditions reduce internal more than external accident costs...|$|E

40|$|In Malaysian {{construction}} industry, one of {{the conditions}} in the contract made between the employer and contractor is to complete a project within a specified time. Failure to fulfil the condition will amount to breach of contract. Main remedy available for breach of contract is an award of damages. Damages are a reasonable sum of money awarded as compensation to the innocent party and {{one of the}} damages available is liquidated damages. It is a genuine pre-estimate amount and provided not to penalise <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b> A building owner will want to claim as much as he can to cover the loss resulted from the delay of completion. The objectives of this research are to identify the basis in ascertaining the amount of liquidated damages and ascertain whether the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable compensation or not. There are elements of cost from nine articles tabulated in a table to create a basis in ascertaining the liquidated damages amount. Twenty elements of cost found and they were divided into major and minor costs. There are seven elements under the major cost and the rest were classified as minor cost. The major costs are financing interest, loss of profit, professional fee, administrative cost, alternative facilities, supervision fees and overhead. Three public projects and two private projects were analysed to ascertain whether the amount of liquidated damages were reasonable or not. As a result, the amount of liquidated damages in public project appears to be reasonable as it is less than the amount of losses suffered. In private projects, the amount of liquidated damages is unreasonable as the amount is more than the losses suffered and can be challenged as penalty by the contractor...|$|E
40|$|Subrogation {{means that}} a person who indemnifies another is {{entitled}} to step into the shoes of the person and take over whatever right he may have against third parties. But, it is found that the insurers are not always successful in their subrogation claims against the wrongdoer in the construction industry. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} insurers? right of subrogation claim in construction contract, this master project has been carried out with the intention to identify circumstances that do not allow insurers to exercise their rights of subrogation. This project has been carried out mainly through documentary analysis of the relevant cases repeated in law journals, such as Malayan Law Journal, Singapore Law Report, Building Law Report, etc. Eighteen cases has been chosen to be analysed in accordance with the feature of right of subrogation against co-insured and the waiver of subrogation clauses in the standard forms of contract. The result showed that, in conjunction with insurance clauses, construction contracts do include provisions that require the insurance policies to be in the form of joint names of the employer, contractor, subcontractor and all related third parties. This would lead to the insurers not being able to exercise the usual rights of subrogation against any of the joint insured. Besides that, the construction contracts also require the insurance policies to contain cross liability or waiver of subrogation clauses. The clauses provide that the insurances carrier, after settling and paying a claim, cannot pursue the damage paid for by the insured parties? insurance carrier. These effectively prevent an insurer from seeking recovery from <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>at</b> <b>fault.</b> So, where a loss has been caused by a subcontractor and the principal contractor seeked recovery, the insurer cannot pursue the claim from the subcontractor...|$|E
