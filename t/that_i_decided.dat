An accomplished jazz musician (The Lounge Lizards being a jazz band's name), Lowe also wrote the main theme music (called [...] "For Your Thighs Only"), {{and some of his}} compositions appear in later entries of the series. The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it [...] "sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to write something with the same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of-sync attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Peterson {{has made}} three cameo {{appearances}} in the films of Gus Van Sant, and as of 1995 had appeared in more Van Sant films than any other actor. His first was Drugstore Cowboy, in which a Peterson commercial plays on the television. Van Sant later cast Peterson in a non-speaking role as a police chief in My Own Private Idaho and used another Peterson commercial in To Die For. Peterson also appeared in Mr. Holland's Opus, which was filmed in Portland. Van Sant related to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "So many people responded <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to keep using him." [...] Van Sant and Peterson have used the same video editor, Wade Evans, and Van Sant bought his Magic Chef refrigerator from Peterson.|$|E

I was so excited, in fact, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> {{to take a few}} days to calm down before writing about it. Well, my waiting period is over, I'm thinking rationally, and I'm still unbelievably stoked about the Tesla".|$|E

500|$|Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: [...] "I {{wanted a}} {{scripting}} language {{that was more}} powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. <b>That's</b> why <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to design my own language." ...|$|R

2500|$|Acquiesce disbanded by January 2001 and Blasko, as Sorija, teamed-up with {{acoustic}} guitarist, Nick Schneider in {{a short-lived}} project, also named Sorija. Blasko remembered that [...] "hings started getting weird {{with the last}} band I was in when we ended up going to counselling together! This was about the time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to leave and started working on some solo stuff". As an acoustic pop-electronic duo they played gigs in Sydney until April 2002.

2500|$|Gorky saw Leskov {{as a true}} {{artist whose}} place [...] "beside masters like L. Tolstoy, Gogol, Turgenev and Goncharov is well-deserved". He was greatly {{intrigued}} by the way Leskov managed to secure himself total independence in the community where no such thing seemed possible ("he was neither Narodnik nor Slavophile, neither Westernizer, nor liberal or conservative") and, at the same time, developed [...] "deep insight {{into the life of}} the existing classes and social groups of Russia... something none of his greater contemporaries like Tolstoy or Turgenev, could ever do". [...] "...It was Leskov who dissected Rus thoroughly," [...] Gorky said (through his character Klim Samgin), later explaining: [...] "Leskov was... the only Russian author to have succeeded in separating the whole generation of his countrymen into a new set of sub-classes, each belonging to a different epoch." [...] Gorky mentioned Leskov among authors that had helped him form his own style and outlook. [...] "It was partly under Leskov's influence <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to go out and see how real people lived," [...] he wrote. [...] "Leskov influenced me enormously, with his knowledge of the Russian language and its richness," [...] Gorky remarked in another letter.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{had been}} with Charles Clasby's law firm for six months when Bob McNeally, a Democrat {{appointed}} as U.S. Attorney for Fairbanks during the Truman administration, informed U.S. District Judge Harry Pratt {{that he would be}} resigning effective August 15, 1953, having already delayed his resignation by several months at the request of Justice Department officials newly appointed by Eisenhower. The latter had asked McNeally to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens's short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. [...] "I said, 'Sure, I'd like to do that,' [...] " [...] Stevens recalled years later. [...] "Clasby said, 'It's not going to pay you as much money, but, {{if you want to do}} it, that's your business.' He was very pissed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to go." [...] Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association were outraged at the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association's meeting that December voted to support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, by Senator William F. Knowland of California, and by the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). [...] Eisenhower sent Stevens's nomination to the U.S. Senate, which confirmed him on March 30, 1954.|$|E
5000|$|At some point, Garmire {{left the}} company, later saying [...] "I loved it. I loved the {{classical}} music. And when they {{switched to the}} rock music, <b>that’s</b> when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to absent myself." ...|$|R

60|$|There was one slight, desperate chance, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I must take--it was for Dejah Thoris, and no man {{has lived}} {{who would not}} risk a {{thousand}} deaths for such as she.|$|E

60|$|It was on {{this part}} of the drive <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> at last I was {{learning}} real mountain-driving. To confess the truth, for delicious titillation of one's nerve, I have since driven over no mountain road that was worse, or better, rather, than that piece.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{congratulate you}} on your success, Mr. Ferguson," [...] he said, shaking hands with the first lieutenant; [...] "it {{has been a very}} hot affair, and by Mr. Morrison's report {{it was just as well}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to change my plan and come up to your aid, though it has {{resulted}} in two of the prahus getting away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt it so {{strongly}} {{at one time}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to develop the love-business into a play by itself and let the other go for some other time.

60|$|To read {{it as it}} lay was an easy matter, and {{it came to me}} then <b>that</b> ere <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> upon {{my course}} it might be well <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should do so.

Naturally enough, perhaps, considering the delicacy of the subject, he has not taken me into his confidence. I can only guess that he has maintained the same reserve with Mrs. Romayne.|$|E
60|$|Evidence of my {{literary}} success, if {{you look}} at it that way, may have lain in an invitation to dine at Andrew Carnegie's, but a suspicion that I was being patronized made me hesitate.
