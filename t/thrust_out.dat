5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} days of the operation, the 697th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division, {{supported}} by NDH units, <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> of their bridgehead over the Drina at Zvornik and cleared the high ground southwest and south of that town, and south along the Drina valley road, hindered by roadblocks and destroyed bridges. It then followed up the retreating insurgents, mopping up the Drinjača valley, before pushing southwest through the mountains and reaching Vlasenica on 18 January. Parts of the 698th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division fought southwest from Višegrad along the upper Drina valley to Međeđa, while other elements pushed west towards Rogatica, followed by an Italian Alpini battalion. The 699th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division advanced along the Drina valley past the confluence with the Drinjača to the area west of Ljubovija, clearing roadblocks as they went. In the area of Milići, they captured about 400 insurgents, mostly Chetniks loyal to Jezdimir Dangić, along with a tank, two machine guns, about 160 rifles and a large amount of ammunition. The regiment then mopped up the area west to Vlasenica and one battalion cleared the route to Srebrenica.|$|E
25|$|The {{chimpanzee}} is tailless; its coat is dark; its face, fingers, {{palms of}} the hands, and soles {{of the feet}} are hairless. The exposed skin of the face, hands, and feet varies from pink to very dark in both species, but is generally lighter in younger individuals and darkens with maturity. A University of Chicago Medical Centre study has found significant genetic differences between chimpanzee populations. A bony shelf over the eyes gives the forehead a receding appearance, and the nose is flat. Although the jaws protrude, a chimp's lips are <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> only when it pouts.|$|E

These were not attached to any other bone, but fit into a pair of deep cavities on the palate and were free to move. The lower jaw was connected with the upper jaw in a way that made the tusk whorl <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> as a dagger when the head was raised. The upper jaw, containing 30 teeth which decrease in size posteriorly, is well preserved in many individuals. Juveniles have six tusks, while adults have three.|$|E
25|$|Dacia, {{exposed as}} it was along its northern, eastern, and western frontiers, could not easily be defended from attack. When barbarian incursions resumed {{during the reign of}} Marcus Aurelius, the defences in Dacia were hard pressed to halt all of the raids, leaving exposed the provinces of Upper and Lower Moesia. Throughout 166 and 167 AD, barbarian tribes (the Quadi and Marcomanni) began to pour across the Danube into Pannonia, Noricum, Raetia, and drove through Dacia before {{bursting}} into Moesia. Apparently, war reached northern Dacia after 167 when the Iazyges, having been <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> of Pannonia, focused their energies on Dacia and took the gold mines at Alburnus Maior (modern Roşia Montană, Romania). The last date found on the wax tablets discovered in the mineshafts there (which had been hidden when an enemy attack seemed imminent) is 29 May 167. The suburban villas at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa were burned, and the camp at Slăveni was destroyed by the Marcomanni. By the time Marcus Aurelius reached Aquileia in 168 AD, the Iazyges had taken over 100,000 Roman captives and destroyed a number of Roman castra, including the fort at Tibiscum (modern Jupa in Romania).|$|E

500|$|Asashōryū's favoured {{techniques}} {{according to}} his Sumo Association profile were migi-yotsu/yori, a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi (belt), and tsuppari, a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. His most common winning kimarite throughout his career were yorikiri (force out), oshidashi (push out), uwatenage (outer arm throw), shitatenage (inner arm throw) and tsukidashi (<b>thrust</b> <b>out).</b> He used 45 different kimarite in his career, a wider range than most wrestlers. In July 2009, he defeated Harumafuji by an [...] "inner thigh throw" [...] or yaguranage, a technique not seen in the top division since 1975. His trademark, however, was tsuriotoshi, or [...] "lifting body slam", a feat of tremendous strength normally only used on much smaller and weaker opponents. In 2004, Asashōryū twice dumped the [...] Kotomitsuki using this technique.|$|E
500|$|Frost {{felt the}} {{excellent}} {{performance of his}} new engine would be a natural fit for a VTOL aircraft due to its high expected power-to-weight ratio. The problem was {{how to use the}} annular thrust to drive the aircraft forward, as well as the problem of fitting the very large engine into a suitable airframe. Frost suggested using a series of ducts and vents to redirect the thrust flowing out of the front of the engine towards the rear. In order to keep the pipes as short as possible, the design ported the <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> along the leading edge of what was essentially a thick delta wing. As the engine was disk-shaped, the triangular delta shape was pushed out near the front where it met the engine disk, producing a shape roughly like a spade on a playing card. For this reason the design was also referred to as the [...] "Avro Ace," [...] a likely reference to the Ace of Spades.|$|E
500|$|Within a day, Moreau {{had four}} {{divisions}} {{across the river}} at Kehl and another three at Hüningen.

On 5 July, the two armies met again at Rastatt. [...] There, under command of Fürstenberg, the Swabians managed to hold the city until the 19,000 French troops turned both flanks and Fürstenberg opted for a strategic withdrawal. Ferino hurried eastward along {{the shore of the}} Rhine, to approach Charles' force from the rear and cut him off from Bavaria; Bourcier's division swung to the north, along {{the east side of the}} mountains, hoping to separate the Condé’s émigrés from the main force. [...] Either division presented a danger of flanking the entire Coalition force, either Bourcier's on the west side of the Black Forest, or Ferino's on the east side.

500|$|Kléber {{carried out}} {{his part of}} the scheme to perfection. Jourdan to cross the Rhine at Neuwied on 10 June. While Charles {{directed}} his forces against Jourdan, on 22 June, the Army of the Rhine and Moselle executed simultaneous crossings at Kehl and Hüningen. At Kehl, Moreau’s advance guard, 10,000 men, preceded the main force of 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry directed at a mere several hundred Swabian pickets on the bridge. The Swabian militia consisted of recruits provided by the members of the Swabian Circle and most of them were literally raw recruits, field hands and day laborers drafted for service in the spring of that year for the Reichsarmee. The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced. Most of the Imperial Army of the Rhine was stationed further north, by Mannheim, where the river was easier to cross, but too far away to support the smaller force at Kehl. Neither Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé's Army of Condé in Freiburg nor Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's force in Rastatt could reach Kehl in time to relieve the Swabian troops. Consequently, within a day, Moreau had four divisions across the river. Unceremoniously <b>thrust</b> <b>out</b> of Kehl, the Swabian contingent reformed at Rastatt by 5 July. [...] There they managed to hold the city until reinforcements arrived, although Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe, where the French had also formed across the river. [...] At Hüningen, near Basel, Ferino executed a full crossing, and advanced east along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th Demi-brigades, the 68th, 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons. [...] The Habsburg and Imperial armies were in danger of encirclement: the French pressed hard at Rastatt and Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine via which they could encircle the Coalition army from the east.|$|E
500|$|In Spring, 1796, when {{resumption}} of war appeared eminent, the 88 {{members of the}} Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. [...] These were literally raw recruits, field hands and day laborers drafted for service, but usually untrained in military matters. It was largely guess work {{where they should be}} placed, and Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location. [...] Consequently, in early late May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by Mainz as if they would cross there—they even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)—Charles thought that main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7,000-man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl. On 24 June, though, at Kehl, Moreau's advance guard, 10,000, preceded the main force of 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry directed at the Swabian pickets on the bridge.
