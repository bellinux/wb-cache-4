5|$|Among the {{distinguished}} sportsmen from Cortina itself are the skiers Enrico Colli, {{his younger brother}} Vincenzo, and Giuseppe Ghedina who competed in the 1924 Winter Olympics, and Severino Menardi {{who participated in the}} 1932 and 1936 Winter Olympics. Other local citizens include <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> Angelo Dibona (1879–1956) and Lino Lacedelli (1925–2009), and the painter Luigi Gillarduzzi (1822–1856).|$|E
5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on the mountain in over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by <b>the</b> <b>climbers.</b> Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Vuelta {{included}} nine summit finishes, none {{of which}} had previously {{been used in the}} race. Unusually, the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks, including all nine summit finishes. It was therefore expected that <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> would need to attack early in the race, in order to build up a significant lead ahead of the lengthy time trial on Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.|$|E
5000|$|... "Turtling" [...] {{can occur}} {{if one of}} <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> limbs is behind the rope and <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> falls off <b>the</b> wall. <b>The</b> <b>climber</b> is flipped upside down, like a turtle on its back. Sometimes this can even eject <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> from <b>the</b> harness and is {{typically}} quite painful when hitting the wall.|$|R
50|$|The belayer {{should keep}} the rope locked {{off in the}} belay device {{whenever}} <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is not moving. As <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> moves on <b>the</b> climb, the belayer must make sure that <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> has <b>the</b> right amount of rope by paying out or pulling in excess rope. If <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> falls, <b>the</b> free-fall {{the distance of the}} slack or unprotected rope before the friction applied by the belayer starts to slow their descent. Too much slack on the rope increases the distance of a possible fall, but too little slack on the rope may prevent <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> from moving up the rock. It is important for the belayer to closely monitor <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> situation, as <b>the</b> belayer's role is crucial to <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> safety.|$|R
50|$|A spotter {{should always}} be used for {{accident}} prevention. A climbing spotter will typically hold their arms up with hands in a supporting position for more or less vertical climbs. When <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> falls, <b>the</b> spotter's hands lightly hold <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> hips or lower back, near <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> center of gravity. This allows the spotter to help guide <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> fall effectively, helping them keep their center of gravity over their feet. When on steeper, past vertical climbs, the spotter will hold their arms out in a cradling position. If <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> falls, <b>the</b> spotter supports the upper and middle back, helping <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> land on their feet.|$|R
5|$|They {{started the}} ascent at 19:00 {{and reached the}} first shelf about two hours later. Here, a field radio was stationed. Later the same evening, they reached the main shelf where the {{aircraft}} body lay. Although finding the remaining bodies, the team only salvaged some post, concluding {{that it would be}} too difficult for them to take down the bodies. They were down again at 01:30. At 10:00 on 20 June, the team again ascended the mountain. Bernt Porten climbed halfway up at least a dozen times, taking water up and bringing down bodies wrapped in tarpaulin. All three bodies and <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> were down again at 21:00.|$|E
5|$|With {{no time to}} make {{a coordinated}} plan of attack for the whole army, Khalid decided to storm the East Gate himself. He, Qa'qa ibn Amr, and Mazur ibn Adi climbed the wall hand-by-hand {{from the side of the}} gate. This part of the wall was the strongest, no guard was {{stationed}} at the top. They secured ropes to the wall and dropped them to 100 selected soldiers waiting at the base. Leaving a few men to assist <b>the</b> <b>climbers,</b> Khalid descended into the city, killing the guards at the inside of the East Gate. Khalid and Qa'qa flung the gate open and the remainder of Khalid's men entered the city. An intense battle ensued.|$|E
25|$|Sher Khan, a Pakistani climber {{who survived}} the attack, {{revealed}} more details. According to his report, the terrorists first made <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> give them money, satellite phones and radio sets, then tied the climbers' hands with ropes. After that, they asked <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> to turn their faces {{in the opposite direction}} and shot them immediately without any explanation.|$|E
5000|$|... lead solo, {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> uses a {{self-locking}} device {{which is used}} to arrest a fall. One end of the rope may be anchored below <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> with <b>the</b> coils of rope in a bag on <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> back, or for single-pitch climbs the device may be secured at ground level, and <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> tied into <b>the</b> end of the rope.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{distance}} from <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> to where <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> would likely {{stop in the}} event of an unprotected fall." ...|$|R
50|$|In mountaineering, a climber can {{employ a}} self-belay with an ice axe {{to prevent a}} slide down a snow-covered slope. To use an ice axe to self-belay, a <b>climber</b> will hold <b>the</b> axe by the head in <b>the</b> <b>climber’s</b> uphill hand. As <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> moves up <b>the</b> slope, <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> will push <b>the</b> shaft of the axe several inches into the snow with every other step. If the axe is set firmly enough, it will aid in {{preventing}} a slip from becoming a fall. If a slip occurs, <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> presses down {{on the head of}} the axe causing the shaft to sink deeper into the snow, anchoring <b>the</b> <b>climber.</b> If this method is unsuccessful, <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> may fall and slide down the slope having to rely on a technique called a self-arrest.|$|R
25|$|The {{descent from}} Camp VII to Base Camp took a further five days and was itself gruelling; all <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> were exhausted, George Bell had badly frostbitten feet and Charles Houston, who had {{suffered}} a head injury, was dazed and concussed. Houston has said that while he is proud of the team's attempt to rescue Gilkey, he feels that making {{the remainder of the}} descent safely was an even greater achievement. During the descent <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> saw a broken ice-axe and some bloodstained rocks, but no other trace of Art Gilkey was found.|$|E
25|$|For the {{piecewise}} linear functions {{there are no}} obstructions. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> can always coordinate their movements {{to get to the}} top, regardless of whether there are intervals of constant height.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>climbers</b> that {{attempted}} {{the north}} face could be easily watched through the telescopes from the Kleine Scheidegg, a pass between Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, connected by rail. The contrast between the comfort and civilization of the railway station and the agonies {{of the young men}} slowly dying a short yet uncrossable distance away led to intensive coverage by the international media.|$|E
50|$|The doubled-rope {{technique}} (DRT or DdRT) {{is used to}} self belay <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> in such a {{way that}} the rope can be retrieved without going back up the tree. One end of the rope is fastened to <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> saddle (harness), from there the rope passes around the tree and back to a friction hitch, which is also attached to <b>the</b> <b>climber.</b> This system allows <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> to easily adjust the rope to provide a belay if free-climbing, or to go up or down if hanging on the rope. As long as <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is below <b>the</b> anchor and there is minimal slack in the system, any fall will be restrained. This system can be placed into the tree from the ground, or <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> can advance <b>the</b> rope up the tree over the course of the climb.|$|R
5000|$|All {{sorts of}} climbers carry prusiks as {{standard}} equipment [...] "just in case". Prusiks {{are unlikely to}} be needed on short climbs where <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> can be readily lowered to the ground; conversely, they may prove useful where <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> cannot be lowered, for instance from a high cliff or due to a hazard underneath <b>the</b> <b>climber.</b>|$|R
25|$|Unlike top-rope {{climbing}} where <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> {{is always}} supported by an anchor located above <b>the</b> <b>climber,</b> lead climbing often has scenarios where <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> will {{be attached to}} a point under him or her. In these cases, if <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> were to fall, the distance fallen would be much {{greater than that of}} top-rope {{and this is one of}} the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The fall factor is the ratio of <b>the</b> height a <b>climber</b> falls and <b>the</b> length of rope available to absorb the fall. The higher the fall factor, the more force placed on <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> as <b>the</b> ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before actually lead climbing on their own.|$|R
25|$|The 1953 American Karakoram {{expedition}} was a mountaineering {{expedition to}} K2, at 8,611 metres {{the second highest}} mountain on Earth. It was the fifth expedition to attempt K2, and the first since the Second World War. Led by Charles Houston, a mainly American team attempted the mountain's South-East Spur (commonly known as the Abruzzi Spur) in a style which was unusually lightweight for the time. The team reached a high point of 7750m, but were trapped by a storm in their high camp, where a team member, Art Gilkey, became seriously ill. A desperate retreat down the mountain followed, during which {{all but one of}} <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> were nearly killed in a fall arrested by Pete Schoening, and Gilkey later died in an apparent avalanche. The expedition has been widely praised for the courage shown by <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> in their attempt to save Gilkey, and for the team spirit and the bonds of friendship it fostered.|$|E
25|$|The cliff's unique {{ecosystem}} hosts lichens, {{as well as}} cedar trees, some {{of which}} may be as much as five hundred years old. It also hosts the mountain's population of peregrine falcons. However, the action of rock climbers has proven destructive to the ecosystem, in addition to being dangerous to <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> themselves. A white cross on the cliff commemorates the death of a boy scout in 1941.|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> had {{recovered}} {{and made their}} way to the tent at Camp VII, Gilkey was lost. He had been anchored to the ice slope as the exhausted climbers prepared the tent, and his muffled shouts were heard. When Bates and Streather returned to bring him to the tent, they found no sign of him. A faint groove in the snow suggested that an avalanche had taken place.|$|E
50|$|To lead a sport climb {{means to}} ascend a route {{with a rope}} tied to <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> harness, and with the loose {{end of the rope}} handled by a belayer. As each bolt is reached along <b>the</b> route, <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> {{attaches}} a quickdraw to the bolt, and then clips the rope through the hanging end of the quickdraw. This bolt is now protecting <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> in <b>the</b> event of a fall. At the top of sport routes, there is typically a two-bolt anchor {{that can be used to}} return <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> to <b>the</b> ground or previous rappel point.|$|R
5000|$|One ally <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> has is a pink [...] "Lucky Balloon"; {{if he is}} able to grab it, <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is transported up 8 {{stories to}} a window. The window onto which it drops <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> may be about to close. If the window that <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not {{actually}} earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.|$|R
25|$|Deep-water soloing (or psicobloc) {{is similar}} to free soloing in that <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is {{unprotected}} and without a rope, but should <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> fall, it is into deep water {{instead of on the}} ground.|$|R
25|$|For the 1924 Everest {{expedition}} Morshead was {{not considered}} able to participate as a climber because of his injuries but he was offered the role of base camp and transport officer. He had to turn this down because his employers would not give permission, even for unpaid leave. However, in the 1924 Olympic Games medals were awarded for mountaineering and Morshead received a special medal awarded to <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> on the 1922 expedition.|$|E
25|$|The ascent {{followed}} {{a long series}} of usually separate attempts by Edward Whymper and Jean-Antoine Carrel to reach the summit. Carrel's group had been 200 m below the summit on the Italian site when Croz and Whymper summited. <b>The</b> <b>climbers</b> from Valtournenche withdrew deflated, but three days later Carrel and Jean-Baptiste Bich reached the summit without incident. The Matterhorn was the last great Alpine peak to be climbed and its first ascent marked the end of the golden age of alpinism.|$|E
25|$|Vincendon and Henry, in the {{meantime}} were totally exhausted and frostbitten and waited in the crevasse to be rescued but the bad weather prevented a successful operation. Multiple attempts to save <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> were made (including a helicopter sent to rescue the party but crashing on the glacier) but they all proved useless. Both climbers died of cold after 10 days exposure. The bodies were recovered only in March 1957. The events that marked this tragedy triggered changes in mountain rescue techniques and procedures in France.|$|E
50|$|Prusiks can be tied {{using other}} {{climbing}} equipment, such as slings already carried by <b>the</b> <b>climber.</b> Three loops allow <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> {{to pass a}} knot in the rope, a difficult task without a third loop.|$|R
50|$|Altitude is {{an indoor}} 3½ story <b>climber.</b> <b>The</b> <b>climber</b> houses a retired {{mountain}} gondola from Keystone, CO and a swaying monkey bridge. At {{the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is Box Canyon, a climber for younger children.|$|R
5000|$|Himalayan mountaineering. High {{altitude}} {{reduces the}} partial pressure of {{oxygen in the}} ambient air, which reduces the ability of <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> to function effectively. Mountaineering rebreathers provide a higher partial pressure of oxygen to <b>the</b> <b>climber.</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{favourable}} {{weather and}} winds, Arun (who is coughing up blood) decides {{to resume the}} climb. Aakash remains at Camp 4 since there is insufficient oxygen for six climbers, and teaches Chand to use the camera. When <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> reach the Balcony, a dangerous storm hits. Although Sameer Khanna tells <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> to stay in one place, Arjun leaves for the south summit without telling anyone. Anjali notices that Arjun is missing; Arun tells Anjali and Tashi to go one way while he and Chand go the other. Arjun, who wanted to climb Everest without oxygen, passes out and is buried by snow. After a two-hour search, Arun and Chand tell Tashi and Anjali to stop; Arjun is probably dead. Searching a bit longer, Anjali and Tashi find Arjun's water bottle and his hand poking out of the snow. They dig him out; Arun and Chand join them, but Arjun refuses water and oxygen. Anjali calls Reena, a BNTV reporter in Everest base camp and Arjun's former lover. After Reena talks to him, Arjun accepts oxygen. When he tells mission sponsor Ramesh Roongta {{that he will not}} continue, Ramesh fears damage to his reputation and is furious. Aakash arrives from Camp 4 with three oxygen cylinders.|$|E
25|$|Tandem or spider rappelling — Involves two climbers {{descending}} on {{the same}} belay device. This is done in some rescue situations when one of <b>the</b> <b>climbers</b> is incapacitated or the descent {{needs to be done}} quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling set-up with the first climber is girth hitched off a sling into the descender on the carabiner, and has an auto-block from belay loop of the harness to the rope as a backup. The second rappeller is also girth hitched into the belay device on the carabiner and also anchored into the main rappeller's harness as a back-up.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2013, about 16 militants, {{reportedly}} {{dressed in}} Gilgit Scouts uniforms, stormed a high-altitude mountaineering base camp in Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan, and killed 10 climbers {{and a local}} guide. <b>The</b> <b>climbers</b> were from various countries, including Ukraine, China, Slovakia, Lithuania and Nepal. A Chinese citizen managed to escape the assailants, {{and a member of}} the group from Latvia happened to be outside the camp during the attack. The attack happened at the base camp on Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest mountain in the world. The mountain is popular among trekkers and mountaineers from June to August because of the moderate weather conditions.|$|E
5000|$|... where mg is <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> weight, h is {{the fall}} height and k is the spring {{constant}} of the rope. Using {{the elastic modulus}} E = k L/q which is a material constant, the impact force depends only on the fall factor f, i.e. on the ratio h/L, the cross section q of the rope, and <b>the</b> <b>climber’s</b> weight. <b>The</b> more rope is available, the softer the rope becomes which is just compensating the higher fall energy. The maximum force on <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> is Fmax reduced by <b>the</b> <b>climber’s</b> weight mg. <b>The</b> above formula can be easily obtained by the law of conservation of energy {{at the time of}} maximum tension resp. maximum elongation xmax of the rope: ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the rope}} goes from <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> to <b>the</b> belayer. Most often used under {{controlled}} circumstances at climbing walls or when <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> doesn't have <b>the</b> weight advantage on the belayer during bottom roped climbs. It {{is impossible to}} escape from the system.|$|R
5000|$|Belaying {{involves}} a person {{standing on a}} stable platform below a rock <b>climber</b> controlling <b>the</b> tension and friction of <b>the</b> <b>climber's</b> rope. Since this activity requires craning one's neck {{to look up at}} <b>the</b> <b>climber,</b> a common malady named [...] "belayer's neck" [...] can occur. The prismatic lenses of the belay glasses are arranged so as to bend light from above through total internal reflection into the observer's eye, allowing the belayer to observe <b>the</b> <b>climber</b> while maintaining a comfortable head/neck position.|$|R
