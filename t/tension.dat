30|$|The <b>tensioning</b> stress {{distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll <b>tensioning</b> was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region to inside. In the exterior loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region to outside. This distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> stresses of circular saw blades <b>tensioned</b> by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll <b>tensioning.</b> However, hammer <b>tensioning</b> has its limitations because the hammer <b>tensioning</b> creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer <b>tensioning</b> is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process is one kind of <b>tensioning</b> methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. A cyclic symmetry {{stress distribution}} and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is produced during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. This <b>tensioning</b> approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic <b>tensioning</b> operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{the studies}} on <b>tensioning</b> {{processes}} of {{circular saw blade}} mainly focus {{on the effect of}} <b>tensioning</b> process on dynamic stability of circular saw blade [5 – 15]. Only a few studies are about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during <b>tensioning</b> process. The theoretical model of roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Szymani. The <b>tensioning</b> stresses obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined <b>tensioning</b> stresses [1]. The model of roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Nicoletti based on finite element method and the <b>tensioning</b> stresses were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll <b>tensioning</b> of circular saw blades which allowed the investigation of various roll <b>tensioning</b> parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{the effects}} of <b>tensioning</b> on the dynamic {{stability}} of the blades have been mainly focused [6 – 16]. The generation of <b>tensioning</b> stress during <b>tensioning</b> processes has been studied by a few researchers. A theoretical model for roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Szymani and Mote [2]. A model for roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Nicoletti based on the finite element method [17]. A finite element model (FEM) for roll <b>tensioning</b> process, which allowed for the investigation of various roll <b>tensioning</b> parameters, was developed by Heisel [18]. A mathematical model of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress in {{the edge of a}} circular saw blade <b>tensioned</b> by multi-spot pressure was established for the quality control of circular saw blades by Li [19].|$|R
5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface <b>tension</b> is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface <b>tension.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because surface <b>tension</b> {{manifests itself}} in various effects, it offers a number of paths to its measurement. Which method is optimal depends upon {{the nature of the}} liquid being measured, the {{conditions}} under which its <b>tension</b> is to be measured, and the stability of its surface when it is deformed.|$|E
5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface <b>tension</b> plays a role.

30|$|<b>Tensioning</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of circular saw blade for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the <b>tensioning</b> processes, roll <b>tensioning</b> process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry. The tangential tensile <b>tensioning</b> stress field is produced which can compensate for the tangential compressive stress caused by thermal stress and improve the stability of circular saw blade [3 – 5]. However, circular saw blade can also obtain radial compressive <b>tensioning</b> stress during roll <b>tensioning</b> process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape. The thin circular saw blade requires higher tangential tensile <b>tensioning</b> stress and lower radial compressive <b>tensioning</b> stress for maintaining stability, which brings a challenge to roll <b>tensioning</b> process of thin circular saw blade.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} {{framework for the}} analysis of <b>tensions</b> in corporate sustainability. The framework is based on the emerging integrative view on corporate sustainability, which stresses the need for a simultaneous integration of economic, environmental and social dimensions without, a priori, emphasising one over any other. The integrative view presupposes that firms need to accept <b>tensions</b> in corporate sustainability and pursue different sustainability aspects simultaneously even if they seem to contradict each other. The framework proposed in this paper goes beyond the traditional triad of economic, environmental and social dimensions and argues that <b>tensions</b> in corporate sustainability occur between different levels, in change processes and within a temporal and spatial context. The framework provides vital groundwork for managing <b>tensions</b> in corporate sustainability based on paradox strategies. The paper then applies the framework to identify and characterise four selected <b>tensions</b> and illustrates how key approaches from the literature on strategic contradictions, <b>tensions</b> and paradoxes-i. e., acceptance and resolution strategies-can be used to manage these <b>tensions.</b> Thereby, it refines the emerging literature on the integrative view for the management of <b>tensions</b> in corporate sustainability. The framework also provides managers with a better understanding of <b>tensions</b> in corporate sustainability and enables them to embrace these <b>tensions</b> in their decision making...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tensions</b> {{can occur}} in the mentor–mentee {{relationship}} during school-based professional experiences that require problem solving. What are the <b>tensions</b> for mentor teachers in preservice teacher education and how might these <b>tensions</b> be resolved? This qualitative study collected data from 31 high school mentor teachers about <b>tensions</b> experienced with preservice teachers during professional experience programmes. Three themes emerged around the causes of <b>tensions</b> (low- to high-level conflicts) within the mentor–mentee relationship, namely: (1) personal issues (i. e. incompatibility, personality differences, language); (2) pedagogical issues (i. e. lack of pedagogical and content knowledge, differences in teaching styles); and (3) professional issues. Strategies to resolve these <b>tensions</b> include: maintaining a positive professional relationship, regular feedback {{as a way to}} address issues, sharing responsibility and empowerment, and using empathy for specific situations. As a theoretical contribution, this study provides a model around low- and high-level conflict associated with personal, pedagogical and professional (3 Ps) issues. The study focused on mentors only and further research is required about the <b>tensions</b> preservice teachers experience with their mentors and ways in which these <b>tensions</b> can be resolved...|$|R
