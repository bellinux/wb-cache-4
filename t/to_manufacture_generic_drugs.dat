In July 2016, the FDA generic drug application backlog comprised 4,036 generics. On the other hand, the European Medicine Agency (EMA), Europe's {{equivalent to the}} FDA, had only 24 generics drug applications awaiting approval. This count includes biologically based biosimilars awaiting approval. The FDA's generic count doesn't include biosimilars, which are more complicated medicines to review.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{intellectual}} property rights in particular patent relating to public health has posed numerous challenges faced by developing countries {{who are members of}} World Trade Organisation (WTO). This paper examines the impact of TRIPS Agreement (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) in relation to developing countries in general with specifi cation made to India. Significant changes brought about by the TRIPS fl exibilities in particular usage of compulsory licensing and Bolar provision have to a certain extent benefited the developing countries in the field of public health during national emergency. The TRIPS flexibilities by way of amendment have helped countries that (do not possess manufacturing capacities) to import medicines. Some developing countries even utilised TRIPS fl exibilities in an aggressive manner to enforce their right to have access to medicines from other countries for the benefi t of their citizens. Further, TRIPs fl exibilities have helped developing countries <b>to</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>generic</b> products <b>to</b> make it affordable to the people. This paper specifi cally examines the impact of the TRIPS Agreement on Indian generic pharmaceutical industry and the legal challenges faced by Indian pharmaceutical industry after the implementation of product patent regime effective from 1 January 2005. The Patent Amendment Act 2005 (India) will be looked into especially on the controversy in respect of Section 3 (d) of the Patent Amendment Act 2005 (India) on the requirement of patentability. The new Section 92 A of the Patent Amendment Act 2005 (India) on the grounds to invoke compulsory licensing will be analysed to see whether Indian government has applied restrictive or broad approach, as compulsory licensing is certainly an important legal weapon for India <b>to</b> <b>manufacture</b> affordable <b>generic</b> medicines. The current challenges faced by India on data exclusivity provision often described as the TRIPS PLUS standard is impliedly stated in Article 39. 3 of the TRIPS Agreement on undisclosed information.

40|$|Compulsory {{licensing}} {{allows the}} use of a patented invention without the owner's consent, with the aim of improving access to essential drugs. The pharmaceutical sector argues that, if broadly used, it can be detrimental to innovation. We model the interaction between a company in the North that holds the patent for a certain drug and a government in the South that needs to purchase it. We show that both access to drugs and pharmaceutical innovation depend largely on the Southern country's ability <b>to</b> <b>manufacture</b> a <b>generic</b> version. If the manufacturing cost is too high, compulsory licensing is not exercised. As the cost decreases, it becomes a credible threat forcing prices down, but reducing both access and innovation. When the cost is low enough, the South produces its own generic version and access reaches its highest value, despite a reduction in innovation. The global welfare analysis shows that the overall impact of compulsory licensing can be positive, even when accounting for its impact on innovation. We also consider the interaction between compulsory licensing and the strength of intellectual property rights, which can have global repercussions in other markets beyond the South...|$|R

5000|$|In 1989, a major scandal erupted {{involving}} the procedures {{used by the}} FDA to approve <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> for sale to the public. Charges of corruption in <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> approval first emerged in 1988, {{in the course of}} an extensive congressional investigation into the FDA. The oversight subcommitee of the United States House Energy and Commerce Committee resulted from a complaint brought against the FDA by Mylan Laboratories Inc. of Pittsburgh. When its application <b>to</b> <b>manufacture</b> generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. Mylan eventually filed suit against two former FDA employees and four drug-manufacturing companies, charging that corruption within the federal agency resulted in racketeering and in violations of antitrust law. [...] "The order in which new <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> were approved was set by the FDA employees even before drug manufacturers submitted applications" [...] and, according to Mylan, this illegal procedure was followed to give preferential treatment to certain companies. During the summer of 1989, three FDA officials (Charles Y. Chang, David J. Brancato, Walter Kletch) pleaded guilty to criminal charges of accepting bribes from <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> makers, and two companies (Par Pharmaceutical and its subsidiary Quad Pharmaceuticals) pleaded guilty to giving bribes.|$|R

40|$|<b>Generic</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{cost-effective}} {{versions of}} brand-name drugs {{approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following proof of pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. <b>Generic</b> <b>drugs</b> are widely prescribed by physicians, although there is disagreement over the clinical comparability of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> to brand-name drugs within the physician community. The objective of this survey was to assess physicians' perceptions of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> and the <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> approval process. A survey was administered to a national sample of primary care internists and specialists between August 2014 and January 2015. In total, 1, 152 physicians comprising of internists with no reported specialty certification and those with specialty certification in hematology, infectious diseases, and endocrinology were surveyed. The survey assessed physicians' perceptions of the FDA's <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> approval process, {{as well as their}} experiences prescribing six <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> approved between 2008 and 2012 using product-specific approval pathways and selected comparator drugs. Among 718 respondents (62 % response rate), a majority were comfortable with the FDA's process in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> overall (91 %) and with letting the FDA determine which tests were necessary to determine bioequivalence in a particular drug (92 %). A minority (13 - 26 %) still reported being uncomfortable prescribing <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> approved using product-specific pathways. Overall, few physicians heard reports of concerns about generic versions of the study drugs or their comparators, with no differences between the two groups. Physicians tended to hear about concerns about the safety or effectiveness of <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> from patients, pharmacists, and physician colleagues. Physicians hold largely positive views of the FDA's <b>generic</b> <b>drug</b> approval process even when some questioned the performance of certain <b>generic</b> <b>drugs</b> in comparison to brand-name drugs.
