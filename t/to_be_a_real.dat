5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E
25|$|The Type B proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> innovation: it {{was found}} that the two-man turret {{dramatically}} increased the rate of fire of either weapon, while still allowing both to be fired at the same time. This design, which they referred to as a duplex mounting, became common on almost all tanks designed after the Mark E.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} coin: the alternator. The alternator can pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either <b>a</b> <b>real</b> or <b>a</b> fake coin (which <b>is</b> lighter than <b>a</b> <b>real</b> one). Each time it <b>is</b> put on <b>a</b> balance scale it switches between pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either <b>a</b> <b>real</b> coin or <b>a</b> fake one. In this paper, we solve the following problem: You are given N coins that look identical, but {{one of them is the}} alternator. All real coins weigh the same. You have a balance scale which you can use to find the alternator. What is the smallest number of weighings that guarantees that you will find the alternator?Comment: 10 page...|$|R
50|$|Apparently, Hergé didn't react {{immediately}} upon discovering this, but probably preferred letting things stand {{as they were}} with this joke which, according <b>to</b> some, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> indication {{of the state of}} mind of the collaborators who wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more involved {{in the creation of the}} adventures of Tintin.|$|R

Upon the discovery of killer, robotic Yeti, Travers fears for the real Yeti but is temporarily suspected of controlling the robotic Yeti himself. Travers assists the Doctor in defeating the Great Intelligence, the true controllers of the robotic Yeti. He pursues what he believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> Yeti after glimpsing it as the Doctor and his companions depart.|$|E
25|$|Vector bundles {{are almost}} always {{required}} to be locally trivial, however, which means they are examples of fiber bundles. Also, the vector spaces are usually required to be over the real or complex numbers, {{in which case the}} vector bundle is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> or complex vector bundle (respectively). Complex vector bundles can be viewed as real vector bundles with additional structure. In the following, we focus on real vector bundles in the category of topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|Chapter Nine – The Mock Turtle's Story: The Duchess {{is brought}} to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in {{everything}} around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her {{with the threat of}} execution and she introduces Alice to the Gryphon, who takes her to the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so that they can play a game.|$|E

50|$|A parody {{advertisement}} {{can be one}} {{in which}} the advertisement appears <b>to</b> actually <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> ad for the false product, but then the advertisement <b>is</b> somehow exposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> parody and if it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> actual advertisement the actual brand becomes clear.

50|$|Although Hiebert's gentle {{brand of}} humour <b>is</b> {{recognizable}} <b>to</b> some in Canada, {{it is not}} uncommon for Americans to believe Sarah Binks <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> person and <b>to</b> excoriate her translations of Heinrich Heine. Some reviewers have suggested models for Sarah, including Canadian poet E. Pauline Johnson. Hiebert said that his character was not based on any single person.|$|R
25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots. The Gambian griot {{turned out not}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> griot, {{and the story of}} Kunta Kinte {{appears to have been a}} case of circular reporting, in which Haley's own words were repeated back to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in Roots.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} 1936 ban on hijab in Iran, {{the rules of}} dress code were relaxed, and after Reza Shah's abdication in 1941 the {{compulsory}} element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned. According to Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, between 1941 and 1979, wearing hijab was no longer offensive, but still considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> hindrance to climbing the social ladder, a badge of backwardness and a marker of class. A headscarf, let alone the chador, prejudiced the chances of advancement in work and society not only of working women but also of men, who were increasingly expected to appear with their wives at social functions.|$|E
25|$|With its {{aluminum}} {{body and}} frame, the Insight was an expensive car {{to produce and}} was never designed for high-volume sales. Instead, it was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> world test car for hybrid technology and a gauge to new consumer driving habits. With an aerodynamic fuel-saving shape similar to the Audi A2, and some unconventional body colors {{it was a bit}} more than mainstream car buyers could handle, preferring more conservative styles. Production halted announced in May 2006, with plans announced to replace Insight with a new hybrid car, smaller than the eighth generation Civic, but not earlier than in 2009. Ahead of this announcement, Honda stopped selling Insight in the UK, for example, as early as December 2005.|$|E

25|$|Housed in the Student Services {{building}} {{near the}} center of campus, the University of South Florida Career Services offers support to students and alumni in the process of dreaming, planning, and achieving their career goals. The on-site staff of Career Counselors teach students how to use a strategic approach in planning for a career path and job search. Career Services helps undergraduates self-assess, learn how to conduct career research, seek out experiences that will give you transferable skills, and search for full-time employment or prepare for graduate school. The office also provides similar assistance to graduate students and alumni to break onto the scene in their field of study and assist them in creating a brand for themselves and gain the tools necessary <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> competitor in the workforce.|$|E
25|$|A rather rare, late-15th-century, variant {{depiction}} of the hortus conclusus in religious art combined the Annunciation to Mary with the themes of the Hunt of the Unicorn and Virgin and Unicorn, so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned {{as a symbol of}} the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many prima facie secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction, partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> animal.|$|E
25|$|The Tiara {{immediately}} {{brings them}} to the World of Sleeping Beauty. The three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, provide gowns and outfits for the trio, but Kilala's dress turns into that of a maid and is forced {{to work at the}} castle's party for Princess Aurora's 17th birthday. Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a glass bead. When they do find it, the little princess gives it to her as a token for her help. Sylphy laughs at Kilala for being naïve and unsuitable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> princess. Princess Aurora finds Kilala on the balcony and tells her to keep on believing in herself and her love for Rei. Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the glass bead turns into a rose quartz and joins with the Tiara.|$|E

25|$|Cleckley {{writes in}} the fifth edition that he remains, since before the first edition, profoundly struck both {{by the lack of}} {{response}} to treatment of those he classes as psychopathic, and by the legal difficulty of trying to detain them in hospital. While noting the issue of the protection of liberty, he argues that better ways must be found to do the latter for their own good and that of society, on the primary basis of demonstrated disability and need, perhaps within psychiatric units but segregated from other patients. He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as shock therapy or lobotomy appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run. He also considers the issue of competency hearings and the insanity defense when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.|$|E
30|$|Our {{presentation}} is organized as follows. We provide {{the statement of}} the problem. Then, we delineate the two-stage estimation of forest cover from a general point of view.
