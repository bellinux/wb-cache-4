5|$|On December 12, 2004, Route 83 was {{dedicated}} as the Trooper Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway {{in honor of}} a New Jersey State Police trooper who was killed on the route {{earlier in the year}} while responding to an armed robbery. In the 2000s, plans were made to improve the intersections at both termini of Route 83. The intersection with Route 47 saw realignment and the installation of a <b>traffic</b> <b>light,</b> along with improvements to Route 47, that cost $6.7 million and was completed in July 2007. In 2006, reconstruction of the Yintersection of US 9 and Route 83 to a T intersection and a new <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> was planned following a school bus accident. The reconfigured intersection was completed on June 10, 2008.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> {{just north}} of that bend, US44 leaves NY22 and turns right through Millerton's {{historic}} downtown. Maple Avenue on the south marks the former northern terminus of NY361. After that junction, Route44 leaves the village. It passes some strip development on the south, bends slightly {{to the north and}} crosses the Connecticut state line just past a car dealership on the south.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953 Babb {{was arrested}} on a drunk-driving charge after running a red <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> and refusing a sobriety test.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>lights</b> {{detection}} and their state recognition {{is a crucial}} task that autonomous vehicles must reliably fulfill. Despite scientific endeavors, it still is an open problem due to the variations of <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> and their perception in image form. Unlike previous studies, this paper investigates the use of inaccurate and publicly available GIS databases such as OpenStreetMap. In addition, we {{are the first to}} exploit conic section geometry to improve the shape cue of the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> in images. Conic section also enables us to estimate the pose of the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> with respect to the camera. Our approach can detect multiple <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> in the scene, it also is able to detect the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> in the absence of prior knowledge, and detect the <b>traffics</b> <b>lights</b> as far as 70 meters. The proposed approach has been evaluated for different scenarios and the results show that the use of stereo cameras significantly improves the accuracy of the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> {{detection and}} pose estimation...|$|R

A book embedding of this graph {{can be used}} to design a schedule that lets all the traffic move across the intersection with as few signal phases as possible.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 2012, an {{intersection}} with Dunreath Drive was opened. This <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> controlled at-grade intersection allowed {{access to and}} from the international terminal of Perth Airport, bypassing Tonkin Highway's intersections with Leach Highway and Kewdale Road/Horrie Miller Drive. The intersection was later removed on 16 July 2015 upon the commissioning of two nearby interchanges as part of Gateway WA.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between westbound Highway403 and eastbound on the parkway being {{provided by a}} loop ramp and access between westbound on the parkway and westbound Highway403 requiring a left turn at a <b>traffic</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
50|$|David Mellor of Sheffield {{produced}} the standard design for street furniture, including <b>traffic</b> <b>lights,</b> in the UK from 1973. The US had installed its first electric <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> in August 1914 in Cleveland, and <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> were first introduced permanently in the UK on 16 March 1928 in Leeds {{at the junction}} of Park Row, Leeds and Bond Street, although were not vehicle-actuated; {{there had been a}} one-day trial of <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> in Wolverhampton on 11 February 1928.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days, this route only had two lanes. However, in 1995, the stretch between the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> {{junction}} at Teluk Intan town center to the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> junction to Federal Route 109 was upgraded into a four-lane, dual carriageway road. In 2004, the stretch between Federal Route 109 to Selabak Estate was also upgraded into a four-lane, dual carriageway, {{as was the}} stretch between the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> junction to Jalan Kampung Banjar and the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> junction at Federal Route 5.|$|R

WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates costs will range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E
5|$|West of MN252, {{the freeway}} {{construction}} started in June 1997. The freeway was opened to traffic in 2000, with a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> {{at the intersection}} of MN610 and US169 initially.

5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For {{controlling}} urban transportations, <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> show similar {{behavior for}} {{different kinds of}} vehicles at intersections. Emergency vehicles need special behavior at intersections, so <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> should behave in different manner when emergency vehicles approach them. At the present time, intelligent <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> control urban transportations intelligently. In this paper the ethical aspect of this topic is considered. A model is proposed for adding special component to emergency vehicles and <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> for controlling <b>traffic</b> in ethical manner.

40|$|AbstractDue {{to recent}} {{advanced}} communication possibilities between traffic infrastructure, vehicles and drivers, the optimization of <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> control can be approached in novel ways. At the same time, this may introduce new unexpected dynamics in transportation systems. Our research aims {{to determine how}} drivers and <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> systems interact and influence each other when they are informed one about another's behaviour. In order to study this, we developed an agent based model to simulate transportation systems with static and dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> and drivers using information about the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> behaviour. Experiments reveal that the system's performance improves when a bigger share of drivers receive information for both static and dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> systems. This performance improvement is due to drivers managing to avoid stopping at red light rather them adapting their speed to different distances to the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> systems. Additionally, it is demonstrated that {{the duration of the}} fixed phases also influences the performance when drivers use speed recommendations. Moreover, the results show that dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> can produce positive effects for roads with high speed limits and high traffic intensity, while {{in the rest of the}} cases static control is better. Our findings can be used for building more efficient <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> systems...|$|R
5|$|NY17A begins {{just south}} of NY17 exit124 {{in the village of}} Goshen. At the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> with the {{southern}} on-ramp from NY17 eastbound, NY207 becomes NY17A. The route quickly climbs to some of the hillier areas south of Goshen, offering views of not only Orange County's Black Dirt Region but Pochuck Mountain and High Point to the south in New Jersey. It then slowly descends past rolling meadows and farmland until it reaches the small village of Florida, where NY94 comes in from the west shortly after the village border. The concurrent roads then become Florida's main street.|$|E
5|$|NY73 {{begins at}} a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> along NY86 near {{the eastern end}} of the village of Lake Placid in the town of North Elba. The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with Mill Pond Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> that had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E

5|$|The {{interchange}} {{continues the}} freeway section of Highway 4 further south, {{by removing the}} <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> at this junction, and also added grade separation with the railway. The other main road in the area is Highway 41 which served the city {{from the start of}} its modern history. This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main transport link to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones, and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange.|$|E
5|$|While NY32 officially remains {{concurrent}} with NY299 {{all the way}} to the <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> at {{the northern}} terminus of NY208, a sign at the Elting Memorial Library, just before the center of downtown, directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street. This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and head out of the village on North Chestnut Street. Once past the village, the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east. NY32 then becomes mostly rural again.|$|E
5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E

5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet a toll-free section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) {{by way of a}} partial interchange. After another , NY33 curves south under Genesee Street before joining it at a <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> in front of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the airport}} {{in the town of}} Massena, NY37 begins to {{parallel}} the north bank of the Raquette River as it intersects NY37C near a hamlet named for the waterway. NY37 and the river continue northeast to the vicinity of the hamlet of Rooseveltown, where NY37 formerly connected to a large traffic circle linking NY37 to the Three Nations Crossing as well as County Route45 (CR45). The traffic circle has since been replaced with a T-intersection and <b>traffic</b> <b>light</b> because of the expansion of the American Customs facility. Upon crossing into Franklin County and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation a short distance to the east, the road narrows back to a two-lane undivided highway and crosses over the Raquette River.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first <b>traffic</b> <b>light,</b> using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{security}} of automotive safety systems and reduce traffic accidents in <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> intersection, In view of this, it is proposed to apply the distance measurement technology of binocular vision ranging in determination of preceding vehicle motion state at the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> intersection, We study the determination of preceding vehicle motion state at the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> intersection based on binocular vision. The system, which is divided into four steps, adopts the theory combining the binocular stereo vision principle and the triangulation principle. First of all, from different angles, image information with preceding vehicles and <b>traffic</b> <b>lights,</b> collected by two CCD cameras, is processed and positioned. Next, two pairs of corresponding feature matching points is obtained by using the stereo matching method. Furthermore, {{the distance between the}} cameras and the preceding vehicle, and the distance between the cameras and the <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> are determined, according to the camera calibration technique, the parallax disparity principle and the triangulation principle. Finally, the determination about the motion state of <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> intersection is determined according to the distance difference principle. Experimental results show that the design, with high measurement accuracy and application value, realize the determination of preceding vehicle’s motion state at <b>traffic</b> <b>lights</b> intersection. ...|$|R
