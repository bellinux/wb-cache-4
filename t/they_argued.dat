5|$|The {{residents}} of Milwaukee Avenue {{and the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) {{in order to try}} to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the houses had significant historic value and needed to be preserved. The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{as in the}} past, {{the main}} points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly {{occupied}} with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and free will. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in philosophy of mind <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in metaphysics <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (<b>they</b> <b>argue)</b> is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include Norman Malcolm andDavid Chalmers.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E

However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary.

5|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, civic leaders advocated a system of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the dams would improve navigation for barge traffic from interior regions to the ocean; provide a reliable source of irrigation for agricultural production; provide electricity for the World War II defense industry; and alleviate the flooding of downriver cities, as occurred in the 1948 destruction of Vanport City, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the silencer {{might not have}} been used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E
5|$|Chiang {{ran into}} stiff {{opposition}} from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, {{the head of}} the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanking was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanking would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanking would cut off the defenders' retreat.|$|E

5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 2013, NBC {{announced}} that the episode would be expanded to fill a one-hour television block, although it still counts as one official episode.

The episode was viewed by 4.06 million viewers and received a 2/6 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E

At the same time, {{they pointed out}} that there was no industry in Lier that would need a railway, and that by building a line, such industry would be established. In April 1897, the committee held a public offering of shares in A/S Lierbanen. At the same time, they sent an application for a social grant to the Ministry of Labour for NOK330,000, plus NOK30,375 from the Norwegian State Railways (NSB).|$|E
5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated {{a series of}} stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first {{like that of a}} fish, then in turn like that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E

5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated because there were no evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E
5|$|Des Roches {{used his}} new {{authority}} to begin stripping his opponents of their estates, circumventing {{the courts and}} legal process. Complaints from powerful barons such as William Marshal's son Richard grew, and <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> that Henry was failing to protect their legal rights {{as described in the}} 1225 charters. A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard's followers. Des Roches sent armies into Richard's lands in Ireland and South Wales. In response, Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn, and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England. Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home.|$|E
5|$|Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not {{consider}} Sinosauropteryx to be birds. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx lithographica plus modern birds. The scientists who described Sinosauropteryx, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any animal with feathers {{is considered to be}} a bird. <b>They</b> <b>argued</b> that the filamentous plumes of Sinosauropteryx represent true feathers with a rachis and barbs, and thus that Sinosauropteryx should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and Sinosauropteryx is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.|$|E
