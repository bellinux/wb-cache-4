5|$|Americans {{expected}} progress, or {{at least}} quantifiable measures of success...It is in their nature to do so. Commando Hunt provided the figures that sated that appetite. Productivity epitomized what <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> become: an exercise in management effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands. In the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} Louis XIV.|$|E

50|$|The ABC News / Washington Post poll {{conducted}} December 9-12, 2010 continued {{to find that}} Republicans remained the most supportive of warfare in Afghanistan: albeit down 35% from the peak in 2007, 50% of Republicans still say <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>has</b> been worth fighting in that country. Among Democrats 36% think <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>has</b> been worth fighting.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> officially ended, a {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year. In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of Caesar and was appointed praetor with consular power.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> {{ended with}} the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and his public role in Vermont's affairs declined. Vermont's government had also become more than a clique dominated by the Allen and Chittenden families due to the territory's rapid population growth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, the course of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E

5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further down along the Rhine. But the events of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
5|$|Expansion during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> been limited, {{with the}} RAN growing to include thirty-seven ships {{and more than}} 5,000 {{personnel}} by 1918. The RAN's losses had also been modest, only losing the two submarines AE1 and AE2, whilst casualties included 171 fatalities – 108 Australians and 63 officers and men on loan from the Royal Navy, {{with less than a}} third the result of enemy action.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>had</b> been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} demands of a {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just before he left the Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E

5|$|In 1915 {{the light}} cruisers Melbourne and Sydney were {{deployed}} to the Atlantic where they worked alongside the Royal Navy's North American and West Indies Squadrons, which {{were engaged in}} surveillance operations on {{the large number of}} German ships that had taken refuge in neutral American ports when <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> broken out. This continued until September 1916 when both cruisers were moved to the North Sea where they joined Australia, which had been assisting the Royal Navy in its blockade of the German High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In December, Wellington's former Quartermaster General, Sir George Murray, {{was sent}} to Canada with the local rank of {{lieutenant}} general, specifically to order Prévost to return to London to explain his conduct of the Plattsburg campaign. Another Peninsular War veteran and Manley Power's previous commanding officer, Sir Edward Pakenham, became {{the commander of the}} British North American army. Manley Power took part in the Battle of New Orleans, where Pakenham was killed, which unbeknown to its participants occurred after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> already been settled in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Armistice, Paris was docked at Plymouth, England. On 3 July 1940, as part of Operation Catapult, British forces {{forcibly}} boarded her and she was used by the British as a depot ship and as a barracks ship by the Polish Navy {{for the rest of the}} war. On 21 August 1945, after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> ended, Paris was towed to Brest where she continued in her role as a depot ship. She was sold for scrap on 21 December 1955 and broken up at La Seyne from June 1956.|$|E

40|$|From the pre-history the man <b>has</b> been {{connecting}} <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{with religion}} {{because in the}} same time he has incessantly been making war and is deeply religious being. By flowing of <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>has</b> been begun to understand independently of the religion. For that we may speak about secularity of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> and bellicosity. <b>The</b> religion has been hidden in the personal intimacy, but <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>has</b> not stopped to be common duty for people in a society. From here is {{the fact that in the}} modern and secularized societies nobody makes <b>war</b> in <b>the</b> name of some militant religious ideas, but in the name of secular ideologies. Because of that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>has</b> stopped to be topic of sociology of the religion, but it has become topic of a new scientific discipline: sociology of <b>the</b> <b>war...</b>|$|R
5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{was decided}} {{the next year}} and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. None of these cases have ever been {{overturned}} by the Supreme Court. The decisions were questioned by legal scholars even before <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> ended. Criticism has included the racist aspects of the cases and the later discovery that officials in the United States Department of Justice lied to the court {{at the time of the}} trial.|$|E
5|$|Other Hispanic servicewomen like Contreras and Cubria served {{either in}} the WAACs, WAVES or MCWR (Marine Corps Women's Reserve); among them Lieutenant Junior Grade Maria Rodriguez-Denton.

5|$|Overall, <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> a {{significantly}} {{negative impact on}} the Australia economy. Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War was ongoing during Robinson's administration. During Robinson's tenure, the Confederacy {{made its}} major advance into the Commonwealth. In {{an attempt to}} protect the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth, Robinson raised taxes in an effort to revive Kentucky's state militia. He was also concerned with the effect <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> on public education in the state. He asked the General Assembly to investigate the condition of state schools, especially in war-ravaged areas, and encouraged them to accept the Lincoln administration's offer of land to establish an agricultural and mechanical college.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} Belgian {{government}} was installed in Eaton Square in the Belgravia area of London, which before <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>had</b> been {{the location of the}} Belgian Embassy.

The offices of the Belgian government were situated close to other governments-in-exile, including Luxembourg, in Wilton Crescent, and the Netherlands in Picadilly.|$|E
5|$|The {{evacuation}} of East Prussia was {{the movement of}} the ethnic German civilian population and military personnel in East Prussia and the Klaipėda region between 20 January and March 1945 as part of the {{evacuation of}} German civilians towards the end of World War II.
