5|$|The {{story is}} set two million years ago. The {{inhabitants}} of the planet Krikkit built a race of androids called the Krikkitmen to wipe out all life in the universe. They were stopped by the Time Lords, who trapped Krikkit within a temporal prison. A group of Krikkitmen which escaped the Time Lords' sentence are trying to reassemble the components of a key which can free Krikkit—components which happen to resemble elements of the Earth game of cricket, itself actually {{a reflection of the}} ancient war. The Doctor and Sarah stumble upon this plot when they see the Krikkitmen steal the Ashes during a test match at Lords. They then travel to the planet Bethselamin to foil <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Krikkitmen's quest.|$|E
5|$|When {{speaking}} about why an online game {{was chosen as}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series, Fujisawa cited the intuitive character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an online game set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A core part of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre-planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt {{as to whether it}} could be an MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of ice skating came in 1742, {{when the first}} ice skating association was formed, the Edinburgh Skating Club. The first instructional book concerning ice skating was published in London in 1772. The book, written by a British artillery lieutenant, Robert Jones, describes basic figure skating forms such as circles and figure eights. The book was written solely for men, as women did not normally ice skate in the late 18th century. It was {{with the publication of}} this manual that ice skating split into its two main disciplines, speed skating and figure skating.|$|E

Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, {{or it can be}} home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.|$|E

There are also fees charged on airline tickets sold, including passenger facility charges and federal taxes. Once the funding is nailed down, the Airport Authority will bid for the project. The replacement terminal is expected to encompass 355,000 square feet and {{the same number of}} gates (14). Also, air travelers will see more restrooms, additional restaurant and concession space, improved security screening areas and other enhanced passenger amenities.|$|E
25|$|A {{wind turbine}} is a windmill-like {{structure}} specifically developed to generate electricity. They {{can be seen}} as <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of the windmill. The first wind turbines were built {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century by Prof James Blyth in Scotland (1887), Charles F. Brush in Cleveland, Ohio (1887–1888) and Poul la Cour in Denmark (1890s). La Cour's mill from 1896 later became the local powerplant of the village Askov. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators in Denmark, ranging from 5 to 25kW. By the 1930s, windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed, built by companies such as Jacobs Wind, Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline, and Winpower. The Dunlite Corporation produced turbines for similar locations in Australia.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{initiation}} {{ceremony was}} the lecture {{given by the}} master of ceremonies, called Mabalasig/Mabalasik (terrible brother), who informed the neophyte to withdraw if he lacked courage since he {{would be out of}} place in the patriotic society. If the neophyte persisted, he was presented to the assembly of the brethren, who subjected him to various ordeals such as blindfolding him and making him shoot a supposedly a revolver at a person, or forcing him to jump over a supposedly hot flame. After the ordeals came to final rite–the pacto de sangre or blood compact–in which the neophyte signed the oath with blood taken from his arm. He was then accepted as a full-pledged member, with a symbolic name by which he was known within Katipunan circles. Bonifacio's symbolic name was Maypagasa; Jacinto was Pingkian and Artemio Ricarte was Vibora.|$|E

25|$|The US and Western Europe have strict {{codes of}} ethics and {{regulations}} in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, {{though there is a}} vast difference in the regulatory framework. Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights. Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E
