50|$|Once an item {{has been}} examined, the expert(s) will issue a {{certificate}} giving their findings {{which will include}} identification, genuineness or otherwise and comments about any alterations or unusual features. The certificate will normally feature {{a photograph of the}} item and be signed. It may also be embossed or have other security features. In the past it was common for experts to sign or add their mark <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> of <b>stamps,</b> however, this is nowadays uncommon as it is by some regarded as an undesired alteration. In Germany (BPP) it is still common practise to sign many items, but generally not the most valuable.|$|R

In an interview with the Radio Times, asked if Adam would become a womaniser like his father Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Robertson replied: [...] "Oh yes, it’s in my contract! Absolutely Adam’s a womaniser and at the minute he doesn’t seem to have much regard for the women he’s with. He doesn’t seem to have much heart, but maybe this is leading to him getting his fingers burnt.|$|R

50|$|Private overprints {{have been}} used for a number of reasons. Generally they cannot be used as control marks, as the stamp or stamps are thus {{rendered}} invalid for prepayment of postage (though some such invalid stamps have successfully passed through the mails, presumably due to an oversight of postal employees). However, while in Great Britain privately overprinted stamps usually served as receipts for tax payments, in 1859, upon application of the Oxford Union Society, there was a unique instance of a private overprint being approved for application on the face of stamps. This is to be distinguished from the more or less frequent application of private overprints <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> of <b>stamps</b> as control marks.|$|R

50|$|A {{cancelled}} {{to order}} (also called and abbreviated CTO) postage stamp is a stamp the issuing postal service has cancelled (marked as used), {{but has not}} traveled through the post, but instead get handed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a <b>stamp</b> collector or dealer. They can come from withdrawn stocks of stamps cancelled in sheets and sold as remainders or from new sheets for sale at reduced rates to the stamp trade. Postal services of various countries do this in response to collector demand, or to preclude stamps issued for the collector market being used on mail. Some {{of the history of}} CTOs is from stamps being given to collectors on an approval basis, in person or through mailings; the first CTOs began in the late 19th century.|$|R

In 1914 the company succeeded in {{creating}} their first Western style dinner set, called [...] "Sedan", to compete with European porcelain companies. Nippon Toki wares were mostly aimed at the European Market. This forerunner of the modern Noritake Company was founded {{in the village of}} Noritake, a small suburb near Nagoya, Japan. Most of the company’s early wares carried one of the various “Nippon” <b>back</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>to</b> indicate its country of origin when exported to Western markets.

These antique snuffboxes cannot be identified by <b>back</b> <b>stamp</b> marks, for none were put on them. There were though four big factories that made the original Limoges snuff boxes at the time, Chantilly(1725-1800), Saint Cloud(1677-1766), Mennecy(1734-73), and Vincennes(1740-56), which became Royal Sèvres(1756-present), though often independent artists of the time would commonly create them with no signature or marking.|$|R

60|$|All this is {{well known}} to hunters; but now comes the curious exception. After I had been {{watching}} the deer for some weeks at one of their playgrounds, a guide came into camp {{with his wife and}} little child. They were on their way in to their own camp for the hunting season. To please the little one, who was fond of all animals, I took her with me to show her the deer playing. As they were running about on the shore I sent her out of our hiding, in a sudden spirit of curiosity, to see what the deer and fawns would do. True to her instructions, the little one walked out very slowly into the midst of them. They started at first; two of the old deer circled down instantly to wind her; but even after getting her scent, the suspicious man-scent that most of them had been taught to fear, they approached fearlessly, their ears set forward, and their expressive tails down without any of the nervous wiggling that is so manifest whenever their owners catch the first suspicious smell in the air. The child, meanwhile, sat on the shore, watching the pretty creatures with wide-eyed curiosity, but obeying my first whispered instructions like a little hero and keeping still as a hunted rabbit. Two little spotted fawns were already circling about her playfully, but the third went straight up to her, stretching his nose and ears forward to show his friendliness, and then drawing <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>stamp</b> his little fore foot prettily to make the silent child move or speak, and perhaps also to show her in deer fashion that, though friendly, he was not at all afraid.|$|R
