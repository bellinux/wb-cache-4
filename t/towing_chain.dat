5000|$|The first {{ships of}} both LCS classes were {{delivered}} before the designs were mature so that improvements {{could be built}} into future ships. Many improvements to the Freedom class came from the problems experienced by [...] on its first deployment including power outages, corroded equipment, a faulty air compressor. To prevent water being taken into the anchor windlass room, the anchor winch, hydraulic unit, and mooring capstan were replaced with a single electric chain winch on the main deck, and the existing <b>towing</b> <b>chain</b> was replaced with a lighter chain. Corrosion resistance was also improved by the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection system being modified by adding protections to the water jet inlet tunnel. Starting with LCS-3, the stern transom was lengthened and buoyancy tanks {{were added to the}} stern to increase weight service and enhance stability. A significantly less complex gas turbine electric start system will be added on LCS-5 to reduce costs and lower ship weight.|$|E
50|$|Several {{days after}} the disaster, Carter tries to set a cross ablaze on George's front lawn blaming him for {{preventing}} him from saving his wife, but {{a chain of events}} causes his tow truck to start driving on its own and as Carter tries to regain control, he is grabbed by the <b>towing</b> <b>chain</b> and is blown up by his truck catching fire with the very gas he was using. The following day, Samantha is finishing up at a beauty parlor when a rock propelled by a lawn mower suddenly impales her eye and kills her. After reading about the events in the paper, Nick becomes convinced that Death is coming after them for evading their fates at the stadium. Hunt and Janet are dubious, but they manage to convince George about what is happening. The group arrives to warn Andy, but he is killed when a tank, propelled by a chain reaction from a faulty wench launches him through a chain link fence. After receiving a premonition involving water, Nick tries to warn Hunt, who has gone for one last conquest at the pool, while George and Lori try to find Janet, who becomes immobilized in a malfunctioning car wash. Hunt drops his lucky coin in the water after an accidental placement of a toy turned the pool's drain on. As he dives into the pool, he is pulled down to the drain where the pressure mounts, and his insides are eventually ripped into the draining system before Nick can rescue him. George and Lori rescue Janet from the car wash at the last second. Afterwards, George admits to having tried to commit suicide due to his family being {{killed in a car accident}} the year before that he believes was his fault, but every suicide attempt has failed. Lori believes saving Janet must have saved the rest of them from Death's plan and the group celebrates instead.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{observations}} on the reactions of flatfish of the Pleuronectidae to electrical stimulation were made by towing a manned sledge supporting an energised electrode array over the sea bed. The electrical stimulus was pulsed DC, ranging in frequency from 4 to 40 Hz. Involuntary muscular contractions were induced by this stimulus which caused the majority of fish to flee from the elec-trified zone. Reactions were classified into a few broad categories and the approximate fish size in each observed event was recorded. The results suggested that the most efficient frequency for inducing flatfish to leave the bottom is around 20 Hz, and that large fish are more strongly stimu-lated by an electric field than small fish; the latter being a significant demonstration under natural conditions of a theory based on aquarium experiments. Observations were made on the reactions of flatfish to a <b>towed</b> <b>chain</b> to assess its comparative efficiency in forcing fish to leave the sea bed...|$|R

This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a [...] "flat tow", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles. As typically a car is being flat towed because the engine won't run, and without a running engine the power brakes don't work, it could be dangerous as well as difficult to slow and stop two vehicles using only the brakes that only half function. Instead, it is typical for the towing vehicle to drive normally, but avoiding sharp acceleration or braking. All the person driving the rear vehicle has to do is gently apply the brakes whenever the <b>tow</b> <b>chain</b> begins to slacken, and anticipate stops so he or she can drag the brakes and come to a halt without excessive slack in the chain. This still requires a relatively skilled driver, as neither the power brakes or power steering will function, and you must take care to steer wide in sharp corners and never allow the chain to slacken, or it may get jerked and broken, or worse, drag underneath the vehicle and possibly cause damage or even loss of control.|$|R

Parkash Singh noticed two other carriers bogged down in a nullah, and under heavy Japanese fire. He immediately rushed to the rescue of the stricken carriers; calling on their crews to abandon the vehicles and run for safety while he provided covering fire. When his Bren gunner was wounded, he took control of the gun from him, and charged towards the enemy. Driving with one hand and firing the Bren gun with the other, he drove them out of their fixed positions. As he returned to pick the crews of the stranded carriers, he came under heavy enemy fire, but calmly rescued all eight men. On 19 January, the battalion carriers again came under heavy anti-tank fire in the same area, and several of them were destroyed including that of the Platoon Commander. The crews of the destroyed vehicles were given up for dead, {{and the rest of the}} carriers withdrew. But Parkash Singh wanted to see for himself if there were any survivors among the burning wrecks. Driving down the beach under intense enemy fire, he found the officer and his driver in their badly damaged carrier. The men were too badly injured to be moved, so Parkash Singh decided to tow their vehicle to safety. Despite the order of his Platoon Commander to go back and save himself, the fearless NCO rigged a makeshift <b>tow</b> <b>chain</b> and secured it to the damaged carrier, all the time exposed to enemy fire, and then towed it back to safety.

During the period of investigation the surface water of the Tyrrhenian Sea north of the strait sill was heavier than the surface water of the Ionian Sea south of the strait sill. As a consequence, during northward tidal flow surface water of the Ionian Sea spread as a surface jet into the Tyrrhenian Sea, whereas during southward tidal flow heavier surface water of the Tyrrhenian Sea spread, after having sunk to a depth of about 100 m, as a subsurface jet into the Ionian Sea. Both jets had the form of an internal bore, which finally developed into trains of internal solitary waves whose amplitudes were larger north than south of the strait sill. These measurements represent a detailed picture of the tidally induced internal dynamics in the Strait of Messina during the period of investigation, which contributes to elucidate several aspects of the general internal dynamics in the area: 1) Associated with the tidal flow are intense water jets whose equilibrium depth strongly depends on the horizontal density distribution along the Strait of Messina; 2) although climatological data show that a large horizontal density gradient in the near-surface layer along the Strait of Messina exists, its reversal can occur; 3) fluctuations in the larger-scale circulation patterns that determine the inflow of the modified Atlantic wate...|$|R

40|$|From <b>towed</b> {{thermistor}} <b>chain</b> {{data collected}} near 140 - 132 ∘W on the equator during April 1987 a diurnally cycling high-frequency internal wave field was observed. Observations from 10 -s-averaged data include zonal wavelengths of 150 - 250 m and vertical structures of wave displacement. From high-passed 20 -Hz data the turbulence dissipation rate, ε, is estimated within the internal wave cycle. To understand wave dynamics both the linear, diagnostic Taylor-Goldstein equation and a nonlinear, prognostic numerical model are solved for conditions {{representative of the}} upper eastern equatorial Pacific {{during the period of}} interest. Unstable Taylor-Goldstein solutions scaled by observed wave displacement amplitudes agreed relatively well with observations. This indicates that a linear instability of the background stratified flow is a possible mechanism for internal wave generation. The wave-induced Reynolds stress divergence from scaled solutions shows that only 100 days of intense wave activity is needed per year for these waves to explain estimated residuals of the mean zonal momentum budget of this region at 50 - to 100 -m depth. Observed ε shows a pattern of turbulent mixing within the wave cycle consistent with wave-induced shear instability but inconsistent with advective instability. The 2 -dimensional, nonhydrostatic numerical model was forced with a diurnally cycling surface heat flux and a steady surface wind stress. Waves generated in the model are due to the combined effects of a shear instability of the background flow and a type of boundary layer forcing known as the obstacle effect. The waves grow rapidly after initial convection and subsequent development of boundary layer eddies. ...|$|R

Today, the AGV plays an important role in the design of new factories and warehouses, safely moving goods to their rightful destination.|$|R
40|$|High {{correlations}} between turbulent dissipation rates and high-wavenumber internal waves {{and the high}} values of turbulent dissipation associated with internal wave activity suggest that internal waves are the main direct source of mixing in the thermocline above {{the core of the}} Equatorial Undercurrent. An extensive dataset obtained using a microstructure profiler and thermistor <b>chain</b> <b>towed</b> along the equator was analyzed to examine the correspondence between turbulent mixing and high-wavenumber internal waves. In the low Richardson number (Ri) thermocline below the mixed layer but above the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent, and when winds were moderate and steadily westward, it was found that: • the spectrum of vertical isotherm displacement was dominated by a narrow wavenumber band (corresponding to 150 – 250 -m zonal wavelength) of internal waves; • both turbulence and internal waves varied diurnally—hourly averaged values of turbulent dissipation rate and wave potential energy were greater by a factor of 100 at night; and • {{correlations between}} turbulent dissipation rate and several measures of internal wave activity (wave isotherm displacement, wave slope, and wave potential energy) were high. Little or no high wavenumber internal wave activity was observed when winds were light or eastward: Superposing plane waves with the observed characteristics on the observed background field suggests that they are inherently unstable to both adjective and shear instability above the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent. These waves are due either to locally generated internal gravity waves or to Kelvin-Helmholz-type instabilities generated in the shear flow; from our measurements these two phenomena could not be distinguished...|$|R
40|$|Observations of {{internal}} waves {{were made at}} the Malin shelf edge during SESAME (Shelf Edge Studies Acoustic Measurement Experiment), {{a part of the}} NERC LOIS-SES experiment, in August-September 1996. These measurements provide a high resolution dataset demonstrating internal wave generation and propagation. This note presents observations of the evolution of an internal bore. The process is shown clearly in a sequence of thermistor <b>chain</b> <b>tows</b> across the shelf break covering a complete tidal cycle, as the double-sided bore transforms into a group of undulations and eventually into more distinct solitary waveforms. Current structures associated with the bore and waves were also observed by ship-mounted ADCP. Analysis of the waveforms in terms of the linear modes and empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) indicate the dominance of the first mode, which is typical of a shallow water seasonal thermocline environment. Determination of the phase speed of the waves from the consecutive ship surveys enabled the Doppler shift in the towed data to be removed, allowing analysis of the real length scales of the waves. The bore evolution has been modelled using a first order non-linear KdV model for the first mode, initialised with the waveform in the first survey. Comparison of the model and the observations show close agreement in the amplitudes, length scales, phase speeds and separations of the leading internal waves as they evolve. Finally, analysis of the observed internal wave shapes indicates that, within the uncertainties of measurement, the wave-lengths lie between those predicted by first and second order soliton theory.

The ethylene glycol chain thicknesses for C 12 E 2 and C 12 E 4 are comparable with their fully extended lengths at the cmc, with values of 10 an 14. 5 ± 1. 5 A, respectively. When A = 55 A 2 these thicknesses decrease low the fully extended lengths, to 6. 5 and 12 A, respectively, indicating some coiling of the ethylene glycol chains.

40|$|Incidents where {{anchor and}} {{pipeline}} interact are rare, but {{such an event}} can have drastic consequences. In the report, "Pipeline and Riser Loss of Containment" by HSE, published in 2001 for the UK sector, 44 incidents involving anchors and pipelines were found for the period 1990 - 2000. Furthermore, The International Cable Protection Committee reported that between 2007 - 2008, there were ten cases of submarine cables damaged due to anchor damage. All of these cases were due to vessels being unaware of their anchors being deployed during transit. The objective of this thesis is to study the anchor s and the pipeline s response to such interactions. The response of the anchor was investigated by performing a parametric study and categorizing the anchor s behaviour. The pipeline was modelled as a 10 meter long constrained rigid body in this study. The literature usually defines anchor behaviour as impact, hooking or pull over. In this study a new system was made for the categorization of the behaviour. The behaviour was either categorized as brief or lasting contact. If categorized as brief, the contact was further defined as either pull over or bounce over. If lasting contact, it was defined either as hooking or sliding, with or without twisting. Seventy-eight models were analysed in the parametric study. The parameters investigated were the anchor s mass and geometry, towing speed of the anchor, size of pipeline and angle of attack between anchor and pipeline. Forty-eight new models were created to investigate the minimum chain length for the towed anchor to reach the subsea pipeline. A constant water depth of 200 meters was applied in all studies. The pipeline s global response was studied by performing eleven case studies. The parameters applied in these cases {{were based on the}} results from the parametric study and the minimum chain length study. In the eleven cases studied, the pipeline was modelled to be 10 kilometer long, with elastoplastic material properties. The pipeline was constrained at the ends, but otherwise allowed to displace and globally deform. The effect of the interaction on the pipeline was investigated by studying the longitudinal strains in the cross-section. The results were compared with DNV s design load strain for combined loading, and with the pipeline s characteristic strain resistance. The study of minimum chain length revealed that for an anchor towed at 2 knots, a chain length approximately 3 meters longer than the water depth was required. For the 10 knot case, due to drag forces, the chain needed to be roughly 110 meters longer than the water depth. However, these results are only valid when the anchor is dropped 100 meters away from the pipeline. The general trend of the anchor behaviour seen in the parametric study, points towards an increase in hooking and sliding with increased mass of anchor, smaller pipe diameter and lower vessel speed. The largest amount of hooking scenarios in the parametric study occurred for 60 degrees angle of attack, as the anchor twisted and hooked. No hooking occurred for the 30 degrees cases, while all sliding events occurred for this angle. Three of the eleven case studies resulted in hooking. In all of these cases, the longitudinal strain in the cross-section of the pipeline exceeded both DNV s design load criteria for combined loading and the pipeline s characteristic strain resistance. Exceeding the characteristic strain resistance puts the integrity of the structure at risk for local buckling. However, a more detailed FEA is necessary to determine the actual response of the cross-section, and which failure mechanisms it may initiate. In the case studies with the full-length pipeline, no hooking was obtained for the attack angle of 60 degrees, which contradicts the results from the parametric study. This may indicate that the rigid modelling of the pipeline, rather than the anchor s response, caused the hooking response in the parametric study. The three of the eleven case studies that resulted in hooking, revealed that the global displacement of the pipeline is much greater when the anchor is towed at a lower velocity. For higher velocities, the hooking case with minimum chain length displaced the pipeline farther, both laterally and vertically, than the anchor <b>towed</b> with maximum <b>chain</b> length...|$|R
