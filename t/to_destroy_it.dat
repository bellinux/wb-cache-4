5|$|The Germans {{were aware}} that the British paratroopers had {{dismantled}} the explosive charges attached to Primosole Bridge, and now attempted <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> by driving trucks laden with explosives onto it. This was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it,</b> and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided to disengage from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and his plan was <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E

5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on how nice her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it,</b> and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, both of {{them leave}} the planetarium, as Yumemi insists on escorting {{him back to his}} vehicle outside the city walls. The protagonist plans to {{transport}} Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out {{and find a way to}} reactivate her. A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from, and he devises a plan <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> armed with only a grenade launcher. After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on, Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist, but is blown in half by the war machine's machine guns.|$|E
5|$|As {{the police}} chase the rapidly {{transforming}} Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses {{samples of the}} mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it {{has the ability to}} end all life on Earth if it spores. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E

5|$|Centaurs {{typically}} behave with {{characteristics of}} both asteroids and comets. Centaurs {{can be classified}} as comets such as 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, and so is classified as a comet despite its orbit, and 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active, and was then classified as both a comet and an asteroid (174P/Echeclus). One plan for Cassini involved sending it to a centaur, but NASA decided <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, however, Sadashiva—who felt insulted by Kanhopatra's refusal—sought {{the help of}} the Badshah (king) of Bidar. Hearing tales of Kanhopatra's beauty, the Badshah ordered her to be his concubine. When she refused, the king sent his men to get her by force. Kanhopatra took refuge in the Vithoba temple. The {{soldiers}} of the king besieged the temple and threatened <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> if Kanhopatra was not handed over to them. Kanhopatra requested a last meeting with Vithoba before being taken.|$|E
5|$|Halleck then relayed the {{contents}} of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor Battle of Manassas Gap, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions {{across from each other}} on the Rappahannock River.|$|E

The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra.|$|E
5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

Scully arrives and holds Peterson at gunpoint, allowing Mulder to upload the virus and destroy the COS.|$|E
5|$|The French Resistance in Paris rose {{against the}} Germans on 19 August. Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted {{to bypass the}} city to pursue other targets, but amid reports that the citizens were going hungry and Hitler's stated intention <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it,</b> de Gaulle insisted {{that it should be}} taken immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc arrived from the west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division pressed up from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E

5000|$|The ever-escalating power, speed, {{and reach}} of {{artillery}} and air power meant that almost any target {{that could be}} located could be destroyed, if sufficient force were massed against it. As such, the more resources a defender devoted to reinforcing a fortification, the more combat power that fortification justified being devoted <b>to</b> <b>destroying</b> <b>it,</b> if the fortification's destruction was demanded by an attacker's strategy. From World War II, bunker busters were used against fortifications. By 1950, nuclear weapons were capable of destroying entire cities, and produced dangerous radiation. This {{led to the creation}} of civilian nuclear air raid shelters.|$|R
5|$|When Leakey {{took the}} position, the {{organization}} had 12 tons of confiscated illegal ivory in its possession, {{which he was}} urged to sell in order to fund conservation efforts. Instead, he piled all of it together and, with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, set it on fire. Ivory does not easily burn, but the choice to use fire rather than other means <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> was intentional as Leakey wanted the event to produce powerful images for the global media. To make the destruction spectacular, Leakey worked with a Hollywood special effects professional to devise an innovative pyrotechnics technique using jet fuel and flammable glue.|$|E
5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original. The most significant change is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens on their home turf whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>it.</b> Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh. Conversely, the character of Inspector Lomax reappears in the film version, having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment, but does not appear in the television version. The character of Sheila the barmaid also appears only in the film version.|$|E

Under the object's evil influence and the strain of constant vigilance, they argue and Ron leaves.|$|E
50|$|A {{summoning}} building. Gates of Hades {{are used}} to summon wraiths. Gates of Hades have a low amount of health, but like War Workshops, they are typically placed near the keep and often well guarded, making them hard <b>to</b> <b>destroy.</b> If <b>it</b> is <b>destroyed,</b> <b>it</b> will banish any currently summoned wraith. Unlike other buildings, a Gate of Hades cannot be rebuilt. Requires 20 crystals to construct; limit of 1 per war.|$|R
