Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's top players. Strong on his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E

50|$|In social psychology, group {{polarization}} {{refers to}} the tendency for a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. These more extreme decisions are towards greater risk if individuals' initial <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> risky and towards greater caution if individuals' initial <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cautious. The phenomenon also holds that a group's attitude toward a situation may change {{in the sense that}} the individuals' initial attitudes have strengthened and intensified after group discussion, a phenomenon known as attitude polarization.|$|R

[...] Raize, who instantly felt that he [...] "had a connection with Simba," [...] eventually won the role with the approval of Taymor and choreographer Garth Fagan, with Fagan admiring the fact that Raize was [...] "willing to try, to fail, and then to try again."

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Jonah {{and his fellow}} Jews is ambivalent, and complicated by the Gloss's tendency to read Jonah as an allegorical prefiguration of Jesus Christ. While some glosses in isolation seem crudely supersessionist (‚ÄúThe foreskin believes while the circumcision remains unfaithful‚Äù), the prevailing allegorical <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> attribute Jonah‚Äôs recalcitrance to his abiding love for his own people and his insistence that God‚Äôs promises to Israel not be overridden by a lenient policy toward the Ninevites. For the glossator, Jonah‚Äôs pro-Israel motivations correspond to Christ‚Äôs demurral in the Garden of Gethsemane (‚ÄúMy Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me‚Äù [...] ) and the Gospel of Matthew‚Äôs and Paul‚Äôs insistence that ‚Äúsalvation is from the Jews‚Äù (Jn. 4:22). While in the Gloss the plot of Jonah prefigures how God will extend salvation to the nations, it also makes abundantly clear‚Äîas some medieval commentaries on the Gospel of John do not‚Äîthat Jonah and Jesus are Jews, and that they make decisions of salvation-historical consequence as Jews.|$|E
2500|$|The {{strength}} of a regular arch (also known as a [...] "square" [...] or [...] "right" [...] arch) {{comes from the fact}} that the mass of the structure and its superincumbent load cause lines of force that are carried by the stones into the ground and the abutments without producing any tendency for the stones to slide with respect to one another. This is due to the fact that the courses of stone are laid parallel to the abutments, which in a regular arch causes them also to lie perpendicular to its faces. For only slightly oblique bridges, where the skew angle is less than approximately 15¬∞ it is possible to use the same construction method, laying the stones in courses parallel to the abutments. The result is known as a [...] "false" [...] skew arch and analysis of the forces within it shows that in each corner where the face forms an acute angle with an abutment there are resultant forces that are not perpendicular to the planes of the stone courses whose <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> push the stones out of the face, the only resistance to this being provided by friction and the adhesion of the mortar between the stones.|$|E

2500|$|The {{need for}} {{instrumentation}} grew with {{the rapidly growing}} central electric power stations after the First World War. [...] Instrumentation was also important for heat treating ovens, chemical plants and refineries. [...] Common instrumentation was for measuring temperature, pressure or flow. [...] Readings were typically recorded on circle charts or strip charts. [...] Until the 1930s control was typically [...] "open loop", meaning {{that it did not}} use feedback. [...] Operators made various adjustments by such means as turning handles on valves. [...] If done from a control room a message could be sent to an operator in the plant by color coded light, letting him know whether to increase or decrease whatever was being controlled. [...] The signal lights were operated by a switchboard, which soon became automated. [...] Automatic control became possible with the feedback controller, which sensed the measured variable, measured the deviation from the setpoint and perhaps the rate of change and time weighted amount of deviation, compared that with the setpoint and automatically applied a calculated adjustment. [...] A stand-alone controller may use a combination of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electronic analogs to manipulate the controlled device.

2500|$|Mill {{not only}} viewed actions as a core part of utility, {{but as the}} {{directive}} rule of moral human conduct. The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Jeremy Bentham, the founder of Utilitarianism, and {{can be seen in}} his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good character. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of [...] "social utility" [...] as Mill puts it.|$|E
