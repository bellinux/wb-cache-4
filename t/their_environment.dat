5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species.

5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and <b>their</b> <b>environment,</b> in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities.|$|E

Conformity between an organism and its environment constitutes what biologists call adaptation. Biotic and Abiotic Environments Plants and animals have adapted to <b>their</b> <b>environments</b> genetically and by means of physiological, behavioral, or developmental flexibility, including both instinctive behavior and learning.

5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in <b>their</b> <b>environment,</b> in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b>  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.|$|E

5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including decorator crabs, which attach materials from <b>their</b> <b>environment,</b> {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another hermit crab, Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of <b>their</b> <b>environment.</b> Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms {{could be used in}} bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds.
