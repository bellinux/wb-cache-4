5000|$|Visible {{light water}} {{splitting}} with a one piece multijunction cell was first demonstrated and patented by William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices during 1983. This group demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen, now {{referred to as}} an [...] "artificial leaf" [...] or [...] "wireless solar water splitting" [...] with a low cost, thin film amorphous silicon multijunction cell immersed directly in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved from the back metal substrate which also eliminated the hazard of mixed hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution. A Nafion membrane above the immersed cell provided a path for proton transport. The higher photovoltage available from the multijuction <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>cell</b> with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with UV sensitive single junction cells.

5000|$|Amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a non-crystalline, {{allotropic}} form {{of silicon}} {{and the most}} well-developed <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> technology to-date. Thin-film silicon is an alternative to conventional wafer (or bulk) crystalline silicon. While chalcogenide-based CdTe and CIS <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> <b>cells</b> have been developed in the lab with great success, there is still industry interest in silicon-based <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>cells.</b> Silicon-based devices exhibit fewer problems than their CdTe and CIS counterparts such as toxicity and humidity issues with CdTe cells and low manufacturing yields of CIS due to material complexity.

30|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in developing <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> silicon solar <b>cells</b> that minimize material costs and maintains high efficiency. It is because that silicon is an abundant element with almost optimal band gap and excellent junction formation characteristics, {{and the availability of}} nano-technologies makes it possible to fabricate high quality desired nano-structures. Currently, most of the solar cells are based on the crystalline silicon wafer with the thickness between 200 and 300 μm, and therefore, around 40 % of the cost is the silicon wafer. Scientists proposed to develop the <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cells</b> to save the cost by decreasing the thickness of the silicon. Moreover, there is another reason to develop <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cells</b> beyond the cost, it is the absorption efficiency. Since the minority carrier diffusion length is less than or around 300 nm for amorphous silicon [1 – 3], it is possible to improve the absorption efficiency for a <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cell.</b> Hydrogenated alloy of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has higher absorption coefficient than that of the crystalline silicon. Due to this fact, in the visible part of the solar spectrum, a-Si:H absorbs almost 100 times more than crystalline silicon. In practice, the thickness of a-Si:H solar cells can be around 0.3 μm only [4]. However, a limitation in all <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cell</b> technologies is that absorbance of red spectrum is too small, because of the indirect band gap of silicon. Therefore, one of the major driving forces in the <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cell</b> field is to structure the light-trapping (LT) schemes in order to increase absorption in the red spectrum. One traditional method is to create surface structure on top of the solar cells. However, those surface structures that were used for LT in wafer-based cells are not suitable for <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cells.</b> Since those structures were mostly pyramids with a size of 2 to 10 μm etched into the surface, they are too thick and too large for the <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cells,</b> even the wavelength-scale texture on the substrate followed by <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cell</b> on top are not suitable for <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> solar <b>cells</b> either.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} detect the hidden defects of the solar cells, the eletroluminescence image was {{obtained}} by applying a certain forward bias voltage to solar cell in the darkroom using the light sensor CCD camera. The experiments were carried out at three states: without optical filter, filtering the wavelength less than 800 nm, and filtering the wavelength greater than 800 nm. It is found that the detection effect is the best only under the lens of filtration of less than 800 nm wavelength. It proves that the cell mainly emits infrared light of 850 ~ 1200 nm. By controlling the detecting time, {{it is found that}} the light intensity is varied with the detection time, and also varied with the forward bias voltage in the same detection time. This method can detect all kinds of hidden defect type of the solar cells. Under the reverse voltage, <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>cell</b> appears small spots which show defect area and density, and the studies prove that <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>cell</b> also can send infrared light and the defects exist in the cell.

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} calculation {{based on}} a transfer matrix method for incoherent optics, allowing the prediction of photovoltaic module efficiencies in different encapsulation conditions is presented. This approach {{is used for the}} experimental validation of the main features of the optical model for multilayer glazing systems considered, through the relation between the external quantum efficiency of the module and its optical modeling. The theoretical procedure avoids the need to manufacture and characterize by solar simulator or external quantum efficiency measurements all the variety of photovoltaic module configurations, which is of interest at research and manufacturing levels, especially for building-integrated photovoltaics. The absorptivity of encapsulated solar cells is not directly accessible from direct air-bare cell or airencapsulated cell optical measurements, and therefore analytical or numerical methods are generally needed. The calculations presented in this work provide closed analytical expressions for the layer-bylayer absorption of the different components of a photovoltaic module. From a small set of experimental measurements of a particular encapsulation configuration, and the theoretical expressions for spectral absorptivities, the short-circuit current of a module can be predicted for any other encapsulation scheme.
