40|$|Abstract — The {{optimality}} of transmit beamforming for {{a multiple}} antenna system with partial/limited feedback is investigated and a single general necessary and sufficient condition for beamforming to achieve ergodic capacity is derived. The condition obtained is universal- applicable to all partial/limited feedback scenarios in all ergodic fading channel distributions regardless {{of the number of}} transmit/receive antennas or transmit power. Using the universal condition we explore the optimality of beamforming for the quantized mean feedback scheme, which generalizes previous results for the separate cases of mean feedback and quantized feedback.

In this paper, {{multiscale}} {{finite element}} methods (MsFEMs) and domain decomposition techniques are developed {{for a class}} of nonlinear problems with high-constrast coefficients. In the process, existing work on linear problems [6, 7, 8] is extended to treat a class of nonlinear operators.

Molecular ecology, within 10 years, has unraveled the factors responsible {{for the emergence of}} several of the economically most important tropical plant viruses: Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), Cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs), Maize streak virus (MSV), and Banana streak virus (BSV).

40|$|Due to the {{enormous}} energy consumption and associated environmental concerns, data centers have been increasingly pressured to reduce long-term net carbon footprint to zero, i. e., carbon neutrality. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, called COCA (optimizing for COst minimization and CArbon neutrality), for minimizing data center operational cost while satisfying carbon neutrality without long-term future information. Unlike the existing research, COCA enables distributed server-level resource management: each server autonomously adjusts its process-ing speed and optimally decides the amount of workloads to process. We prove that COCA achieves a close-to-minimum operational cost (incorporating both electricity and delay costs) compared to the optimal algorithm with future information, while bounding the potential violation of carbon neutrality.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of composite steel-concrete beams subjected to combined bending and shear at both service and ultimate conditions. In particular, it is shown that for realistic composite bridge arrangements {{it is important}} to account for the shear deformability of the steel beam for an accurate prediction of the instantaneous and long-term deflections, which otherwise might be underestimated. At the ultimate limit state conditions, it is highlighted that for an adequate evaluation of the composite response subjected to significant actions of combined moment and shear force, it is necessary to consider the shear behaviour of the steel and slab components. This is accomplished comparing the results of three composite beam models accounting for the deformability of the shear connection at both service and ultimate conditions, while varying the beam models adopted to represent the response of the slab and the steel beam.

This work describes and proves convergence of a new algorithm called Push-Sum Distributed Dual Averaging which combines a recent optimization algorithm [1] with a push-sum consensus protocol [2]. As we discuss, the use of push-sum has significant advantages. Restricting to doubly stochastic consensus protocols is not required and convergence to the true average consensus is guaranteed without knowing the stationary distribution of the matrix in advance. Furthermore, the communication semantics of just summing the incoming information make this algorithm truly asynchronous and allow a clean analysis when varying intercommunication intervals and communication delays are modelled.
