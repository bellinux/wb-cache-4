5|$|Warner Bros. {{cancelled}} the Paris, Mexico, and Japan premieres of The Dark Knight Rises, {{and suspended}} the film's marketing campaign in Finland. Several broadcast networks also suspended television ads {{for the film}} in the United States. The trailer for Gangster Squad, another Warner Bros. movie included in the screening of The Dark Knight Rises, was removed as it contains a scene which shows gangsters shooting submachine guns at moviegoers <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> similar to the shooting in Aurora.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E

At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying.

Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

25|$|Still {{searching for}} a single-tube {{solution}} that was bright enough for direct viewing, in 1942 Baird hit upon the Telechrome concept. His solution was essentially to combine two tubes into one large spherical enclosure. In {{the center of the}} enclosure was a translucent mica sheet forming the display, covered on one side with cyan phosphor, the other with an orange-red color, producing a limited but useful color gamut. Two electron guns arranged {{on either side of the}} screen fired at it, producing the two colors. The image was viewed from one side, seeing one of the colors directly and the other being transmitted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> from the other side. This was the first single-tube color television system.|$|E

500|$|The trailer {{shown in}} the United Kingdom during a break from The Gadget Show was banned after a ten-year-old child complained that it was [...] "distressing" [...] and [...] "inappropriately scheduled". Clearcast had cleared the trailer for 19:00 GMT, but did not {{actually}} air until 20:29. In one scene of the trailer, people in a cinema become trapped to the seats by metal restraints with a hand coming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> pulling a person in. The Advertising Standards Authority said it was [...] "likely to cause distress to young children". In Massachusetts, a branch of Showcase Cinemas showed Saw 3D instead of the cartoon Megamind, which was being watched by a seven-year-old celebrating a birthday.

500|$|Critics panned The Wiz {{upon its}} October 1978 release. Many reviewers {{directed}} their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed {{was too old}} to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Screen</b> Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized [...] "Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay", and called [...] "Believe in Yourself" [...] the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: [...] "cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive"; and noted that the film was [...] "a critical and box office bust". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as [...] "one of the decade's biggest failures", and, [...] "the year's biggest musical flop". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that [...] "the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as [...] "expensive crud". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, [...] "The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults." [...] Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating [...] "The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 24 November 1941, the 1st Battle Squadron, Barham, Queen Elizabeth, and Valiant, with an escort of eight destroyers, departed Alexandria to cover the 7th and 15th Cruiser Squadrons as they hunted for Italian convoys in the Central Mediterranean. The following morning, the , commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Diedrich von Tiesenhausen, detected the faint engine noises of the British ships and moved to intercept. By {{the afternoon}} the submarine and the 1st Battle Squadron were on reciprocal courses and von Tiesenhausen ordered his boat to battle stations around 16:00. An ASDIC operator aboard {{one of the leading}} destroyers, , detected the submarine at 16:18 at an estimated range of , but the contact was disregarded as it subtended an angle between 40 and 60 degrees wide, far larger than a submarine. U-331 thus passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and was only in a position to fire her torpedoes after the leading ship, Queen Elizabeth, had passed her by and the second ship, Barham, was closing rapidly. Von Tiesenhausen ordered all four bow torpedo tubes fired at a range of [...] at 16:25. Possibly due to her closeness to Valiants bow wave and discharging the torpedoes, the boat's conning tower broached the surface and was fruitlessly engaged by one of the battleship's [...] "pom-pom"s at a range of about [...] The boat dived out of control after she broached, reaching an indicated depth of , well below her design depth of , before she stabilised without any damage. U-331 was not attacked by the escorting destroyers and reached port on 3 December. Von Tiesenhausen was not certain of the results of his attack and radioed that he had hit a Queen Elizabeth-class battleship with one torpedo.|$|E

2500|$|The cotton gin is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} cotton fibers from seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand.
