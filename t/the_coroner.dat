5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. <b>The</b> <b>coroner</b> said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Although some eyewitnesses {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, was at fault, following a few words from <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> the jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

5|$|As was {{usual in}} the district, the inquest {{was held at}} the Lamb Tap public house, Chiswick, by <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock, on 2 January 1889.

At probate, his estate was valued at £2,600 (equivalent to £ today).|$|E
5|$|Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled {{her death}} an accident; {{a case of}} {{starvation}} with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and starvation. Due to {{a hole in the}} closet, she could not have suffocated.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Dr. Dre and Jenita Porter had a son, Andre Young Jr. In 1990, Porter sued Dr. Dre in Orange County Superior Court seeking $5,000 {{of child}} support per month.

5|$|On 4 January 1970 Moon {{accident}}ally {{killed his}} friend, driver and bodyguard, Neil Boland, outside the Red Lion pub in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Pub patrons {{had begun to}} attack his Bentley and Moon, drunk, began driving to escape them. During the fracas, he hit Boland. After an investigation, <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> ruled Boland's death an accident and Moon received an absolute discharge after being charged {{with a number of}} offences.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coroner</b> {{reported}} that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol {{were found in}} Smith's system {{at the time of}} his death but did find prescribed levels of antidepressant, anxiolytic, and ADHD medications, including Clonazepam, Mirtazapine, Atomoxetine, and Amphetamine. There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
5|$|The {{post-mortem}} examination concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit {{and died of}} asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. At the inquest, <b>the</b> <b>coroner,</b> finding no evidence of suicide and lacking sufficient evidence of the circumstances, recorded an open verdict. Dannemann stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage.|$|E
2500|$|Clements {{also accused}} the police {{of failing to}} {{investigate}} his death fully.

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. <b>The</b> <b>coroner</b> returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. <b>The</b> <b>coroner</b> also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became {{increasingly}} concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00am that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to <b>the</b> <b>coroner,</b> not the police. At midday <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. <b>The</b> <b>coroner</b> determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. <b>The</b> <b>coroner</b> examines it and notices {{what appears to be}} a metal vertebra.

5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} <b>the</b> <b>Coroner</b> for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two {{witnesses}} were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit {{on the head with}} a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor of}} Albany was the {{executive}} officer and {{selected by the}} Lieutenant Governor.

The mayor, recorder, and aldermen were also justices, the assistants however did not have any judicial powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} turned {{public opinion}} against Dow, {{and he was}} denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General Nathan Clifford, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator William P. Fessenden. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced <b>the</b> <b>coroner</b> to impanel a jury that pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.|$|E
