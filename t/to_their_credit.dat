5|$|In late 2009, Dover was {{selected}} as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, {{it was announced that}} Dover and the Canadian team {{had not been able to}} agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end.

During his time as a trainer for Canada, he was no longer be eligible to train top riders with the USEF. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe of the US national dressage team. He is expected to remain in the position through the 2016 Summer Olympics.

5000|$|Credit card fraud - Fraudsters {{will call}} with {{promises}} <b>to</b> repair <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> ratings, provide credit options or credit facilities, credit cards with zero or very low interest, or instant and unlimited loans without credit checks or security.

25|$|Crime and detective {{fiction has}} enjoyed wide {{popularity}} in Tamil Nadu since the 1930s.

25|$|In 1800, {{when she}} first met them, Marshman was appalled by the neglect with {{the way in which}} William Carey looked after his four boys; aged 4, 7, 12 and 15, they were unmannered, undisciplined, and even uneducated. Carey had not spoiled, but rather simply ignored them. Marshman, her husband and their friend the printer William Ward, took the boys in tow. Together they shaped the boys as Carey pampered his botanical specimens, {{performed}} his many missionary tasks and journeyed into Calcutta to teach at Fort William College. They offered the boys structure, instruction and companionship. <b>To</b> <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> - and little to Carey's - all four boys went on to useful careers.|$|E

With three albums <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> by 2001, Bacon's tour schedule included eight concerts for the summer of that year, at venues from New York City, down the East Coast, and into the Midwest to Peru, Illinois and Missouri.

They appeared in Howard Goodall's Big Bangs, broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in March 2000. Treasures of Christ Church (2011) {{is an example of the}} choir's recording and debuted as the highest new entry in the UK Specialist Classical chart.

25|$|Bayern Munich {{then became}} the first club to win three {{consecutive}} titles, with Borussia finishing only a point behind the champions in 1974. Die Fohlen {{was able to take}} some consolation in a 2–1 victory over 1. FC Köln in 1973 to win their second DFB-Pokal. Under coach Hennes Weisweiler, the young side displayed an offensive-minded philosophy and powerful play that attracted fans from all over Germany. The team stayed on the attack and matched Bayern's achievement with three consecutive titles of their own from 1975 to 1977. Mönchengladbach lost the 1977 final of the European Cup to Liverpool, but also made four appearances in the UEFA Cup with wins in 1975 and 1979 against losses in 1973 and 1980. The club's spectacular run had come to an end with eight trophies <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>credit,</b> and although they would continue to be competitive for many years, success would be much harder to come by.|$|E
25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E
25|$|This {{political}} nature {{often leads}} to more private infrastructure such as roadways. <b>To</b> <b>their</b> <b>credit,</b> Miami-Dade Transit {{has not been an}} accountable organization, coming on the brink of shut-down in 2011, when they were audited by the federal government. On the other hand, the many tolled highways in Florida, for example, generate a significant amount of money for the state, whereas like many mass transit systems in the US, systems such as Metrorail and Metromover have always been a significant loss, financially speaking. Even some of the highway toll collection operations in Florida are privatized. Miami-Dade Transit's federal investigation, which included criminal investigation in addition to audits, revealed likely fraud among other wasteful spending; service cuts and a shut down of the AirportLink project nearly resulted. Tri-Rail is considered an exceptional loss; for fiscal year 2010, train revenue was approximately US$10.3 million, while total operating expenses for fiscal year 2010, including depreciation expense, were approximately US$86.9 million. Expenses increased by approximately US$14.9 million or 20.7% when compared to fiscal year 2009. During this time service was cut and an altogether shut down was threatened.|$|E

Coddington later noted that [...] "the priests got two of the magistrates on their side, and so got the major part with them". With the deputies then casting their votes, Wheelwright was declared guilty of [...] "contempt & sedition" [...] for having [...] "purposely set himself to kindle and increase" [...] bitterness within the colony. Though sentencing was deferred to the next court, the controversy now became a political issue.|$|E
