5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} <b>the</b> <b>fishermen.</b> Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|In {{his tent}} on the beach, Zurga {{notes that the}} storm has abated, as has his rage; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir (""). Leila is brought in; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir's life, but his jealousy is rekindled. He confesses his love for her, but refuses mercy (""). Nourabad and some of <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready. As Leila is taken away, Zurga observes her giving one of <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> her necklace, asking for its return to her mother. With a shout, Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> {{started to}} work in {{maritime}} activities, as pilots or seafarers in {{the crew of the}} Portuguese ships, due to their high nautical knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>fishermen</b> of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high technical skills. The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers' social class, well-off gentlemen, was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square.|$|E

There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock's Eve is an evolution of this festival.

One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.|$|E

5|$|Caldas da Rainha's {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} by Queen Leonor, before {{municipal}} coats of arms were typically used in Portugal.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1836, a group of five {{fishermen}} caught their nets on timbers protruding {{from the bottom of}} the Solent. They contacted a diver to help them remove the hindrance, and on , Henry Abbinett became the first person to see the Mary Rose in almost 300 years. Later, two other professional divers, John Deane and William Edwards, were employed. Using a recently invented rubber suit and metal diving helmet, Deane and Edwards began to examine the wreck and salvage items from it. Along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects, including several longbows, they brought up several bronze and iron guns, which were sold to the Board of Ordnance for over £220. Initially, this caused a dispute between Deane (who had also brought in his brother Charles into the project), Abbinett and <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> who had hired them. The matter was eventually settled by allowing <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> a share of the proceeds from the sale of the first salvaged guns, while Deane received exclusive salvage rights at the expense of Abbinett. The wreck was soon identified as the Mary Rose from the inscriptions of one of the bronze guns manufactured in 1537.|$|E

The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly ("").

Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> {{caught a}} quantum fish. "Fisherman, {{please let me}} go", begged the fish, "and I will grant you three wishes". <b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> agreed. <b>The</b> fish gave <b>the</b> <b>fisherman</b> a quantum computer, three quantum signing tokens and his {{classical}} public key. The fish explained: "to sign your three wishes, use the tokenized signature scheme on this quantum computer, then show your valid signature to the king, who owes me a favor". <b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> used one of the signing tokens to sign the document "give me a castle!" and rushed to the palace. The king executed the classical verification algorithm using the fish's public key, and since it was valid, the king complied. The fisherman's wife wanted to sign ten wishes using their two remaining signing tokens. <b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> {{did not want to}} cheat, and secretly sailed to meet the fish. "Fish, my wife wants to sign ten more wishes". But the fish was not worried: "I have learned quantum cryptography following the previous story (<b>The</b> <b>Fisherman</b> and His Wife by the brothers Grimm). The quantum tokens are consumed during the signing. Your polynomial wife cannot even sign four wishes using the three signing tokens I gave you". "How does it work?" wondered <b>the</b> <b>fisherman.</b> "Have you heard of quantum money? These are quantum states which can be easily verified but are hard to copy. This tokenized quantum signature scheme extends Aaronson and Christiano's quantum money scheme, which is why the signing tokens cannot be copied". "Does your scheme have additional fancy properties?" <b>the</b> <b>fisherman</b> asked. "Yes, <b>the</b> scheme has other security guarantees: revocability, testability and everlasting security. Furthermore, if you're at sea and your quantum phone has only classical reception, you can use this scheme to transfer the value of the quantum money to shore", said the fish, and swam away.
