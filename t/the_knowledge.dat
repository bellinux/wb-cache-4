5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres {{of learning in}} the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of herbal medicines. Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his Opera Medicinalia, synthesised <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.|$|E

50|$|Consolidation of <b>the</b> {{previously}} learned <b>knowledge</b> and <b>the</b> {{new information}} is important. If <b>the</b> previously learned <b>knowledge</b> is well consolidated in memory, the impeding influence {{caused by the}} new encoding has less effect; inversely, if the newly learned information is better encoded than <b>the</b> old <b>knowledge,</b> <b>the</b> interference is greater. This is especially true when <b>the</b> previously learned <b>knowledge</b> is simply encoded in short-term and working memory—basically, {{the low level of}} consolidation. The similarity between the new information and old knowledge can have an effect on performance as well. When the recently acquired information is phonologically and semantically similar with <b>the</b> known <b>knowledge,</b> <b>the</b> rate of retroactive interference is increased through confusion between the two materials.|$|R
5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Arab scientists.

40|$|Universities have, traditionally, been {{recognised}} as the loci {{of scientific}} knowledge production and transfer.

25|$|Although some {{linguists}} {{have proposed}} that evidentiality should be considered separately from epistemic modality, other linguists conflate the two.

30|$|<b>The</b> {{presented}} <b>knowledge</b> representation {{approach was}} {{compared with the}} most common used technique for representing <b>the</b> domain <b>knowledge,</b> which is called network of concepts technique. The evaluation results showed that <b>the</b> presented <b>knowledge</b> representation approach improves {{the efficiency of the}} system’s navigation support. It recognizes either the domain concepts that are already partly or completely known for a learner or the domain concepts that s/he has forgotten, taking into account <b>the</b> learner’s <b>knowledge</b> level of <b>the</b> related concepts of the learning material. As a result, <b>the</b> presented <b>knowledge</b> representation approach constitutes an ideal way for representing <b>the</b> domain <b>knowledge</b> of an adaptive and/or personalized tutoring system in a more realistic way. It constitutes a driver for an adaptive and/or personalized system for delivering the learning material to each individual learner dynamically, taking into account her/his learning needs and her/his different learning pace.|$|R
