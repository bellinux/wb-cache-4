5000|$|In ancient times, {{during the}} reign of the one-hundred sixth emperor of Japan, Go-Nara-in of Chinzei there was a man named Tandai Ōuchi Tatara Ason Nii Hyōbugyō Yoshitaka. His {{ancestor}} was called Prince Rinshō Imseong, the third son of King Seong of Baekje. Incidentally, on the eighth day of the ninth month of 595 in the reign of Empress Suiko, a big radiant star suddenly fell from the heavens in Aoyanagai no Ura, Washizunoshō Tsuno District, Suō Province and landed on top of a pine tree. It was like the light sent out by a full moon, and it shone for seven days and nights. The various peoples of the region were very surprised and thought it strange. They immediately engaged a shamaness. She spoke, [...] "I am Hokushin Myōken Sonshō, <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> {{on the second day of}} the third month, Prince Imseong of Baekje should come to this country. I have announced this fact to Prince Shōtoku and he has agreed that Prince Imseong should stay. Accordingly, I humbly reported the gist of this to the Empress in Kyoto. Empress Suiko was delighted, and on the second day of the third month of the same fifth year of 597, when over one-hundred imperial court nobles arrived at Tataranohama in Suō Province, the Empress boarded the boat of Prince Imseong and landed at Tataranohama. The prow of the boat was designed as a dragon head and the neck of a fabulous seabird, befitting a noble. She immediately had a palace built in Nagato no Kuni Ōuchi Province and bade him live there. Accordingly, a palace was built promptly for Prince Imseong on Washizuyama.

Her braided long hair is golden and so bright that it makes the water glow. She asks if Ailyp will take her hand in marriage. Ailyp happily agrees. The girl's old nanny {{explains}} that the girl's name is Golden Hair and she {{is the daughter of}} Poloz the Great Snake, who has control over gold. The girl's hair is of pure gold and so heavy that it chains her to the spot. Ailyp collects the hair and starts walking away with his bride-to-be, but Poloz does not want to let his daughter go. He starts pulling the hair underground. Golden Hair takes the scissors and quickly cuts off her braid. She disappears underground, leaving Ailyp with just her braid. The girl's nanny approaches him and says that the girl is back on her spot by the river, but Poloz made her hair even heavier than before so that Ailyp wouldn't be able to lift it. She says to Ailyp: [...] "Go home and live like you did before. If you don't forget your bride Golden Hair in three years, I will come back and take you to her". After three long years Ailyp goes back to the river. Golden Hair says that his memories of her were making the hair lighter with each passing day. She suggests that they try running away again, but Poloz catches them and makes Golden Hair's braid even longer and heavier. The nanny tells Ailyp: [...] "Go back home and wait for another three years. Exactly <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> you must go to her". From the wise eagle-owl Ailyp learns that there's a place underneath Lake Itkul where Poloz is powerless.

40|$|A service robot is a robot which {{operates}} semi or fully autonomously to perform services {{useful to the}} well-being of humans and equipment. Service robots are mobile or manipulative or a combination of both. Conventional robots find their limitation if the task execution requires a level of perception, dexterity and decision making which cannot be met technically in a cost-effective or a robust way. However, within the otherwise manual task execution less demanding subtasks may still be carried out automatically. A safe and flexible co-operation between robot and operator may be a promising way to achieve better productivity at a manual workplace. Thus, robot assistants can be thought to be clever helpers in manufacturing environments (manufacturing assistant) as well as in services (home and care assistant).

The current research asked if age priming college students (N = 61) affects their memory for pictorial images of older persons. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} one of <b>three</b> groups (one <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> prime, age 70 prime, and no prime).

Research on priming suggested that having participants think about themselves at age 70 would influence identification with a new in-group (older adults). However, all groups remembered more negative (p <. 001) and inconsistent (p <. 001) stereotype pictures of older adults. This may be due to the novelty of the images. The priming of a different age group may also be difficult because college students strongly identify with their roles as young adults. Future research should assess if different types of priming affect memory for age stereotyped behaviors...|$|R

Adaptation to an online system {{has led to a}} structural change {{in the way in which}} knowledge is disseminated and materials produced, and the application of the so-called Bologna Process (adaptation to the European Higher Education Area, EHEA) has brought with it the need to change certain habits in the way knowledge is disseminated, a new credit transfer system (ECTS) and skills-based training. The Department has taken part in a pilot test project initiated by the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). In this period of change, we are simultaneously offering three teaching systems: the traditional system, in line with the study plan from 2002; the Bologna Process system, started in 2005 - 2006, and the online system, which was started in the academic year 2001 - 2002 and which does not form part of the Bologna Process.

The prime risk area where decant points are likely to develop is in a zone about 500 m wide straddling Main Reef Road and the M 2 motorway, plus a secondary zone some two kilometres to the south. deep basements of buildings and other sub-surface infrastructure in the risk zones could experience flooding and the underground facility at Gold Reef City, a national treasure, will be lost. The problem can be solved by establishing pump stations at shallow depth in the mining belt to keep the water at a safe depth below surface. a depth of 300 m is recommended {{in order to protect the}} Gold Reef City facility. The technological capability to do this is readily available, and the necessary water treatment processes are well established. although initially expensive, the pumping operation may ultimately generate a profit.

30|$|For future research, {{longitudinal}} {{studies on the}} impacts of such kind of teacher development programs on student change in academic performance {{would be useful to}} address several questions: First, the classroom practice observation revealed nuances when knowledge and beliefs are translated into practice. While becoming more sensitive to language use as evidenced by teachers’ attention to language features at the three levels and their oral conversation with the students when assignments are returned, we wonder how teachers would provide follow up instruction without an assessment design specifically related to the detailed language objectives. Second, what is the impact of such kind of teacher development on students’ academic performance over time? The grant that supported this research was distributed {{in such a way that}} we were unable to compare individual student school performance over an academic year. We were limited to a semester when collecting this data, thus focusing more on teacher performance alone. Full cycles of instructional objectives, student performance, feedback from teachers, and follow-up student performance on similar tasks with the same group of students would provide data to reveal teacher effectiveness on student learning as a result of teacher development. Third, what is the lasting effect of such kind of professional development on teacher practice? <b>Three</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> after having completed this study, it would benefit us to follow up with the teachers to determine whether or not they are still attentive to the language demands of the curriculum content they teach. Finally, how are state teacher evaluation systems compatible or not compatible with linguistically informed education across the curriculum? After all, teachers’ performance is heavily influenced not only by their beliefs, but also external force coming from local, state, and federal authorities. An answer to this question would have implications for all stake holders.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} project, {{started in}} September 2004 and with the {{duration}} of three years, {{is the study of}} Paratuberculosis incidence in sheep herds in one of the best Portuguese cheese production region. Every year producers suffer great economic losses {{due to the lack of}} control of the disease in their herds. Thirteen sheep herds were selected based in clinical signs of paratuberculosis disease. A serological survey by Elisa test, performed in 1220 animals, revealed that 5. 6 % were positive. Fourteen positive (9. 7 %) AGID tests, performed so far in 145 animals, were obtained. Post-mortem examination of these 14 animals revealed typical macroscopic lesions of paratuberculosis in all of them. Histophathological analysis showed suspected paratuberculosis microscopic lesions in seven animals. Bowel tissues with lesions, from the same 14 animals, were cultured in selective media for bacteriological analysis and also for direct detection with the ADIAVET kit. Seven tissue samples processed until now allowed the isolation of six strains, identified as Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis by bacteriologic conventional methods. To start the molecular epidemiological study of paratuberculosis these six strains, and others isolated in the future, will be typed by molecular methods using IS 900 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. This molecular approach will allow the detection of sources and routes of infection, essential for disease control. After these preliminary results, we intend to develop methods to rapidly detect Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in milk samples from infected and non infected sheep. With all the field and laboratory information and results gathered, it is our perspective, in <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> to have controlled paratuberculosis in sheep herds from Serra da Estrela region, and also to have a safe guaranty for the consumer of Serra da Estrela cheese...|$|E
