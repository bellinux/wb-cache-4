5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E

5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others {{due to the fact}} that he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
30|$|Other {{conditioning}} variables {{include the}} earnings before an individual began collecting disability benefits and {{the duration of}} their CPPD spell as of the start of our data. We expect both prior earnings and time on disability to proxy for otherwise unobserved variables such as motivation, determination or attractiveness. For example, if highly motivated and determined workers do persistently well in the labor market, conditioning on earlier labor market outcomes should help to remove selection bias that results from motivation or determination {{playing a role in}} receipt of VR. Indeed, the literature suggests that prior outcomes often {{play a critical role in}} the plausibility of a “selection on observed variables” identification strategy. For this reason, we condition flexibly on pre-program earnings. In particular, we use a cubic polynomial of earnings 1 -year prior <b>to</b> <b>applying</b> <b>for</b> CPPD benefits, a cubic polynomial of earnings 2 -years prior <b>to</b> <b>applying</b> <b>for</b> CPPD benefits, interactions between earnings 1 - and 2 -years prior <b>to</b> <b>applying</b> <b>for</b> CPPD benefits as well as indicators for zero earnings 1 - and 2 -years prior <b>to</b> <b>applying</b> <b>for</b> CPPD benefits. This sort of conditioning set is in the spirit of what has been done in the literature evaluating the Workforce Investment Act using similar methods by, e.g., Heinrich et al. (2013) and Andersson et al. (2013). Aakvik et al. (2005) also include some pre-program variables in the conditioning set in their analysis of the Norwegian VR program as do Dean et al. (2013 a, b) in their study of VR in Virginia.|$|R

5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

5|$|Claudette was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in July in the United States since Hurricane Danny in the 1997 season. The hurricane caused one death and moderate damage in Texas, mostly from strong winds, as well as extensive beach erosion. Because of the damage, President George W. Bush declared portions of South Texas a Federal Disaster Area, allowing the affected citizens <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> aid. Claudette also caused significant rainfall and minor damage in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo as a tropical storm, as well as minor damage on Saint Lucia before developing into a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>for</b> EU membership.|$|E
