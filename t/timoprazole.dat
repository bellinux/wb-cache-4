50|$|Three drug {{categories}} {{have been}} used to inhibit H+/K+ ATPases. H2-receptor antagonists, like cimetidine (Tagamet), inhibit the signaling pathway that leads to activation of the ATPase. This type of inhibitor is effective in treating ulcers but does not prevent them from forming, and patients develop tolerance to them is developed after about one week, leading to a 50% reduction in effect. Proton pump inhibitors were later developed, starting with <b>timoprazole</b> in 1975. PPIs are acid-activated prodrugs that inhibit the hydrogen potassium ATPase by binding covalently to active pumps. Current PPIs like omeprazole have a short half-life of 90 minutes. Acid pump antagonists (APAs) or potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) are a third type of inhibitor that blocks acid secretion by binding to the K+ active site. APAs provide faster inhibition than PPIs since they do not require acid activation. Revaprazan was the first APA used clinically in east Asia, and other APAs are being developed since they appear to provide better acid control in clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{inhibitory}} {{effect of the}} three benzimidazole derivatives <b>timoprazole,</b> picoprazole, and omeprazole on histamine and dbcAMP stimulated 14 C-aminopyrine accumulation (=H' secretion) has been studied in isolated and enriched guinea-pig parietal cells. All compounds tested inhibited H ' secretion in a concentration dependent manner with IC 50 values of 85 ± 1. 9 gmol/l for <b>timoprazole,</b> 3. 9 +O 07,umol/l for picoprazole, and 0 13 ± 003,umol/l for omeprazole. The IC 50 of <b>timoprazole,</b> when dbcAMP {{was used as a}} stimulus, did not differ significantly from that of histamine stimulation. The type of inhibition was of a non-competitive nature. The full acid response to histamine after temporary exposure of the cells to the benzimidazoles could be restored by washing the cells twice; this suggests that the inhibition is reversible. The data-among others- indicate that the properties of the benzimidazoles described here would allow these compounds to be used as effective antisecretagogues. Substituted benzimidazoles represent a new class of potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. Typical representatives of this chemical structure have been shown to block acid secretion in experimental animals ' and man, 2 in isolated rabbit gastric glands, 3 and in the isolated guinea-pig gastric mucosa. 45 Substituted benzimidazoles have a mechanism of action which is different from the other anti-secretagogues known so far. There is strong evidence that this new class of compounds interferes with the gastric proton pump, the H ' K+-ATPase, 6 and thereby inhibits acid secretion. It is {{the purpose of the present}} investigation to study the relative potencies of the three substituted benzimidazoles <b>timoprazole,</b> picoprazole, and omeprazole, in isolated and enriched guinea-pig parietal cells and to elucidate the type and stability of inhibition in this preparation...|$|E
