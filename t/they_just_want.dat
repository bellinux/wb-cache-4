25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to do it {{when they get to}} the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright Emlyn Williams, {{to go over the}} script and cut extraneous dialogue. [...] There were wide expectations of a hit; producer Mike Todd came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York [...] "because it's too damned good for them". The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright George S. Kaufman joked that people lining up there at the Shubert Theatre [...] "don't actually want anything... <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to push money under the doors." ...|$|E

500|$|Israeli {{journalist}} Lily Galili attributed this {{to being}} {{in part due to}} an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. She explained, [...] "They come from this huge empire to this tiny Israel and they say: 'Is that all, is that the country? And what, you want to give back the territories? Who gives up territory in the first place! And in this small country. You must be kidding!'" [...] Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, [...] "Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time. And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to solve the problems swiftly." ...|$|E
500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that. Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have to be brave at difficult times. And they have to be able to understand the issues. I knew the answers to problems but I wasn't being allowed to solve all the problems".|$|E

Furthermore, {{he said that the}} inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: [...] "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to get money for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whistle-blowers {{are often}} high-performing {{employees}} {{who believe they}} are doing their job (Martin, 2005). <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to bring people's attention to a problem that is potentially harmful or unethical. [...] Despite this, whistle-blowers are perceived negatively and suffer grave consequences. They are often ostracized, harassed, and attacked by their superiors and coworkers. They face termination, financial losses, stress, relationship breakdown, and health problems. Even worse, few whistle-blowers seem to bring about any change. The organization seems to put all their efforts into destroying the whistle-blower while ignoring the original problem. The organization will take great measures to cover-up the problem, devalue the target, reinterpret the events, and intimidate and/or bribe the whistle-blowers (Martin, 2005).|$|E
2500|$|Armenia, {{which has}} no coal, natural gas or oil of its own and scant wind and water resources, had long been {{suffering}} from severe energy shortages and now blockaded by neighbouring Turkey and Azerbaijan, from whom it used to import nearly all its fuel, was forced to announce that it would restart the second of two VVER reactors in the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant. Armenian Environmental Committee Chairman Samuel Shahinian explained the decision; [...] "Our people are so cold we cannot explain anything to them, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to be warm." [...] The reactors, which had been commissioned by the Soviet authorities in 1979 and had long been considered dangerously out-of-date, were shut down in 1988 over safety concerns following the nearby Spitak earthquake. The announcement prompted uproar in Turkey whose border is just 17km from Metsamor. [...] "There are certain risks", confirmed Armenian Deputy Speaker Ara Sahakian, [...] "but we should realise and everyone should realise we have no other choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Susan Griffin {{was one of}} {{the first}} feminists to write on pornography's {{implications}} in her 1981 Pornography and Silence. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin's positions, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, [...] "To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual." [...] She explained sexual harassment by saying that it [...] "doesn't mean that they all want to fuck us, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to hurt us, dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us." [...] Some see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm. Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.|$|E

You'd better take an axe with you to open their skulls; there is no other way." [...] How this legend started I don't know, but I think it is because the English are jealous of the Scotch. They got into the Union with them in 1707 and they can't get out. The Scotch don't want Home Rule, or Swa Raj, or Dominion status, or anything; <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> the English. When they want money they go to London and make it; if they want {{literary}} fame they sell their books to the English; and to prevent any kind of political trouble they take care to keep the Cabinet well filled with Scotchmen. The English for shame's sake can't get out of the Union, so they retaliate by saying that the Scotch have no sense of humour. But there's nothing in it.
