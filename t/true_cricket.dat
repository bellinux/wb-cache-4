He made his first-class debut for Victoria in February 1969 against Queensland, the final match of Victoria's 1968–1969 Sheffield Shield season. Despite taking five wickets in the match, he did not get a chance to play in the 1969–1970 season due to the depth in Victoria's bowling. He earned a second match in December 1970 and became a regular in the 1971–72 season, playing a total of 135 matches for Victoria.|$|E

The tropical forests of north-east India harbour a high diversity of little-studied terrestrial murid and hystricid rodents. We examined {{the role played}} by these rodents in determining the seed fates of tropical ever-green tree species in a forest site in north-east India. We selected ten tree species (3 mam-mal-dispersed and 7 bird-dispersed) that varied in seed size and followed the fates of 10, 777 tagged seeds. We used camera traps to determine the identity of rodent visitors, vis-itation rates and their seed-handling behavior. Seeds of all tree species were handled by at least one rodent taxon. Overall rates of seed removal (44. 5 %) were much higher than direct on-site seed predation (9. 9 %), but seed-handling behavior differed between the terrestrial rodent groups: two species of murid rodents removed and cached seeds, and two species of porcupines were on-site seed predators.

We found 309 caches formed by the rodents and the cricket; most were single-seeded (79 %) and seeds were moved up to 19 m. Over 40 % of seeds were re-cached from primary cache locations, while about 12 % germinated in the primary caches. Seed removal rates varied widely amongst tree species, from 3 % in Beilschmiedia assamica to 97 % in Actinodaphne obovata. Seed predation was observed in nine species. Chisocheton cumingianus (57 %) and Prunus ceylanica (25 %) had moderate levels of seed predation while the remaining species had less than 10 % seed predation. We hypothesized that seed traits that provide information on resource quantity would influence rodent choice of a seed, while traits that determine resource accessibility would influence whether seeds are removed or eaten. Removal rates significantly decreased (p < 0. 001) while predation rates increased (p = 0. 06) with seed size. Removal rates were significantly lower for soft seeds (p = 0. 002), whereas predation rates were significantly higher on soft seeds (p = 0. 01). Our results show that murid rodents play a very important role in affecting the seed fates of tropical trees in the Eastern Himalayas. We also found that the different rodent groups differed in their seed handling behavior and responses to changes in seed characteristics...|$|E

50|$|Organisms {{with such}} a {{widespread}} distribution in isolated patches might well be expected to show considerable variation, {{and it is likely}} that the marked similarity between various species of the Tridactylidae reflects their comparatively small numbers and constrained type of habitat. Although their distribution suggests an ancient lineage, the Tridactylidae are a fairly uniform, easily recognised family. Historically however, their affinities have been the occasion for confusion. Originally they were seen as a subfamily, Tridactylinae, of the Gryllidae, the <b>true</b> <b>crickets,</b> closely related to the Gryllotalpidae or Gryllotalpinae, the mole crickets. Other opinions at some times assigned them to the full family Gryllotalpidae.|$|R
50|$|The {{features}} which distinguish crickets in the superfamily Grylloidea {{from other}} Ensiferans are long, thread-like antennae, three tarsal segments, slender tactile cerci {{at the tip}} of the abdomen and bulbous sensory bristles on the cerci. They are the only insects to share this combination of characteristics. The term cricket is widely, but loosely, used to describe any cricket-like insect in the order Ensifera, being applied to bush crickets (Tettigoniidae), Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatus), camel crickets and cave crickets (Rhaphidophoridae) and wetas (Anostostomatidae), and the relatives of these. All these insects have four tarsal segments and are probably more closely related to each other than they are to the <b>true</b> <b>crickets,</b> Gryllidae.|$|R

50|$|No {{species have}} wings with sound-producing {{structures}}; moreover, evidently none has structures it {{could use to}} hear sound. This contrasts with <b>true</b> <b>crickets</b> and katydids, who use their wings to produce sounds and have hearing organs to sense sounds of others. Jerusalem crickets also seem unable to hiss by forcing air through their spiracles, as some beetles and cockroaches do. Instead, the few Jerusalem crickets that do make sound rub their hind legs against {{the sides of the}} abdomen, producing a rasping, hissing noise. This hiss may serve to deter predators rather than to communicate with other crickets. For such purposes, Jerusalem crickets rely on substrate vibrations felt by subgenual organs located in all six of the insect's legs.|$|R
5000|$|... "Parktown prawn" [...] is {{a common}} name for Libanasidus vittatus, a species of king cricket endemic to Southern Africa. It is {{unrelated}} to prawns, Libanasidus being insects in the order Orthoptera - crickets, locusts and similar insects. The king crickets are not really crickets either: they belong to the family Anostostomatidae, whereas <b>true</b> <b>crickets</b> are in the Gryllidae. The insect gets its English name from the suburb of Parktown in Johannesburg, South Africa where they are common. In Angola, it {{is found in the}} southern savanna and semi-arid regions, whereas in Namibia it is found throughout the territory. The Parktown prawn is related to the New Zealand tree weta, which is also in the family Anostostomatidae.|$|R
50|$|Ensifera is a {{suborder}} of {{the order}} Orthoptera, including insects in the families Gryllidae (<b>true</b> <b>crickets),</b> Prophalangopsidae (grigs), Stenopelmatidae (Jerusalem crickets, king crickets, tree and giant wetas), Gryllacrididae (leaf-rolling and raspy crickets), Cooloolidae (cooloola monsters), Rhaphidophoridae (cave and camel crickets), Schizodactylidae (dune or splay-footed crickets) and Tettigoniidae (bush crickets or katydids). The Tettigoniidae are sometimes known as the long-horned grasshoppers to distinguish them from the other suborder of Orthoptera, the Caelifera or short-horned grasshoppers. Ensifera {{is believed to be}} a more ancient group than Caelifera, with its origins in the Carboniferous period, the split having occurred {{at the end of the}} Permian period. Unlike the Caelifera, the Ensifera contain numerous members that are partially carnivorous, feeding on other insects as well as plants.|$|R

25|$|Regarding invertebrates, the {{burrowing}} owl seems {{less of a}} generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem <b>crickets</b> (Stenopelmatidae) and <b>true</b> <b>crickets</b> (Gryllidae). Bothynus and Dichotomius anaglypticus scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten far more often than even closely related species by many {{burrowing owl}}s across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, {{it was noted that}} among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up. Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls.|$|R
5000|$|These insects, {{now called}} [...] "Mormon crickets" [...] {{because of this}} incident, are not <b>true</b> <b>crickets,</b> but instead belong to the katydid family. Having {{ornamental}} wings, {{they are unable to}} fly, but instead can travel in huge swarms. Mormon crickets eat all plant material in their path, but they also cannibalize any insects that die on the way, including their own species. They are known to cyclically swarm in some areas of the Mountain West, especially in Utah and Nevada. These insects threatened the livelihood of the Mormon pioneers; stomping on the pests did not dissuade them from entering farms as others would advance. This is a reproductive strategy similar to mast reproduction in oaks, overwhelming predators with sheer numbers allowing a percentage of the population to survive to reproduce. Mormons often cast this disaster in Biblical terms like the 8th plague of locusts.|$|R
40|$|TYPE SPECIMEN: “There are a {{total of}} six paratype and paratotypes {{distributed}} between CAS (California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco) and UM (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) but the number in each is not known. However, several specimens in the Tinkham collection were lost or destroyed, and the number may not reflect the number in these collections ” (Tinkham 1962 as cited in Johnson 1992). TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: On the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern United States, Daihinibaenetes arizonensis is 1 of 3 species in the genus. All three species (D. arizonensis, D. giganteus, and D. tanneri) are very similar morphologically and all are only known from a few widely scattered localities in an area in which gryllacridids have been poorly collected (includes southern Colorado and Utah, northern New Mexico, and Arizona). Cohn (1992), believes that D. arizonensis may represent merely one population of a more widespread species that is reasonably common in sandy habitats. Thus, D. arizonensis, D. giganteus, and D. tanneri may be synonymized into one species. DESCRIPTION: Cricket-like appearance.

500|$|All {{acknowledged}} subject {{experts and}} authorities {{agree that there}} is no evidence of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of [...] "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket". It is <b>true</b> that <b>cricket</b> is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.|$|R
