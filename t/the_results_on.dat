When using these systems, actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E

5|$|Miliband campaigned in the Scottish {{independence}} referendum {{with the}} cross-party Better Together campaign, supporting Scotland's {{membership of the}} United Kingdom. Opinion polls showed solid leads for the 'no' campaign, with a 20 point-lead on 19 August. However, {{by the end of}} the month, the lead has fallen to just 6 points, with YouGov analysis showing a big shift in support among Labour supporters. Miliband made an unplanned visit to Lanarkshire to draw a contrast between a Labour and Conservative future for Scotland within the UK. A poll on 7 September showed a 2-point lead for the 'yes' campaign, leading to a joint commitment by Miliband, Cameron and Clegg for greater devolution to Scotland through a version of home rule. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>on</b> 19 September showed victory for the 'no' campaign, 55.3% to 44.7%.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{investigations}} and the examination in Rome of <b>the</b> <b>results,</b> <b>on</b> 2 April 1993, Pope John Paul II approved the pursual of the Roman phase of the cause, declaring Edmund Rice to be venerable. Two years later, the same Pope approved a miracle attributed to Edmund Rice's intercession. The miracle occurred in 1976, when Kevin Ellison of Newry, had been given only 48 hours to live due to complications from a gangrenous colon, and an apparent lack of viable colon tissue (a conclusion reached by five doctors after hours in surgery). A family friend, Christian Brother Laserian O'Donnell, gave Ellison's parents a relic of Edmund Rice. Many friends prayed for a miracle through the intercession of Rice and a special Mass was offered for Ellison's recovery. Only the relic of Edmund Rice was placed at the bedside of the dying man. The latter survived the 48-hour period during which he was supposed to die, and more besides. Upon investigation, surgeons discovered a considerable length of previously undetected colon. Ellison fully recovered after a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|Nine inscribed copper plates {{thought to}} belong to the mature Harappan phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing. The Indus {{characters}} in the plates are mirrored, and the loss in groove definition indicates repeated cleaning and polishing of the surface. The plates are also significantly larger than any seal, and much thicker, the thickness thought to help support pressure applied to their surface. The large nature of the plates makes them an unlikely candidate for seals as the tablets thus produced would be prone to breakage. The metal composition of the plates were characteristic for that period and location, and showed significant corrosion, indicating its ancient nature. Continuing patination {{across the surface of the}} plate, including on the lines, indicates that the marks were not made recently on an ancient piece of metal. On testing the plates for printing using two kinds of ink (water and oil based) onto rag paper, silk and parchment, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>on</b> all three materials were found to be of remarkable quality. All these suggest that these plates point to the first known examples of printing in the world. One of the plates contains 34 characters, the largest number of characters found so far on any single object from Indus findings.|$|E
