25|$|As {{an emotion}} {{regulation}} strategy, people can bet against a desired outcome. A New England Patriots fan, for example, could bet their opponents to win {{to reduce the}} negative emotions felt if the team loses a game. People typically do not bet against desired outcomes {{that are important to}} their identity, due to negative signal about their identity that making such a gamble entails. Betting against your team or political candidate, for example, may signal to you that you are not as committed to them as you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
500|$|During the 19th and 20th century, the {{industrial}} and working class makeup of Old Kent Road {{made it a}} haven for organised crime and violence. The notorious Richardson Gang operated in the area, and boxing clubs became popular. Lennox Lewis' manager Frank Maloney {{grew up in the}} area and recalled, [...] "If you weren't into crime, people <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a pansy". Draining the Surrey Canal in 1971 uncovered a number of cracked and blown safes that had been thrown in the water.|$|E
500|$|Skelton's {{first major}} post-television {{recognition}} came in 1978, when the Golden Globe Awards named {{him as the}} recipient for their Cecil B. DeMille Award, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment. [...] His excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette. When he was presented with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation. [...] "I {{want to thank you}} for sitting down", he said when the ovation subsided. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> pulling a CBS and walking out on me." [...] The honor came 16 years after his television program left the airwaves.|$|E

500|$|Wolpaw {{said that}} while many story {{elements}} of Portal are revisited in Portal 2, he avoided some of the memes—such as the frequently repeated [...] "the cake is a lie". He said, [...] "if you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sick of the memes, I was sick of it way ahead of you". Wolpaw [...] "couldn't resist putting in just one" [...] cake joke. The writers {{did not try to}} predict or write new memes, and Wolpaw said, [...] "you can't really plan for [...] because if you do it probably seems weird and forced". Portal 2 produced its own memes, including a space-obsessed personality core. Valve later created a Space Core modification for the game [...] (see below), and the Space Core also appeared as a laser-based engraving on a panel manufactured by NASA for the International Space Station.|$|E
500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F sharp minor with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems like just yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your arms around me tight/Everything it felt so right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t get to see the tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV noticed that the song [...] "soared on crunchy guitars, driving beats and anthemic, agitated choruses." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{immediately}} {{went back into}} the Bradford side, and added his second goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day. Darlington made a bid to sign Colbeck on a permanent basis during January 2008, but City chairman Julian Rhodes turned down the bid, and Colbeck was a regular player {{for the rest of the}} 2007–08 season. The run of games included the third goal in a 3–1 win against former side Darlington at the Darlington Arena. On 19 April 2008, he scored his sixth goal for the club, but first in a home game, when his last minute goal gave Bradford a 2–1 win over Grimsby Town. Three days later, Colbeck was announced as the club's player of the season, even though he had started just 26league games, 23 of which came in City's 26games since Colbeck returned on loan from Darlington. Colbeck was surprised to win the award, saying: [...] "If you'd said at the beginning of the season that I would win this award, I'd have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> mad. I wasn't even a regular in the team." [...] However, in the following league game, Colbeck was sent off for the second time in his career, for a foul on Dean Lewington, as City lost 2–1 to Milton Keynes Dons, which meant he missed the final game of the season through suspension.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many critics, though some {{were not as}} happy with it. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade, and wrote that what he [...] "liked most of all" [...] was it being [...] "remarkably clear-eyed about {{who these people are}} and what they're capable of". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as [...] "heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a [...] "tearful and touching finale". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a [...] "nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had [...] "the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations" [...] and described it as [...] "a season finale that sure felt like a series finale". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, you would have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> watching one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E

I never saw you as a man...I saw you as my father." [...] Finally, the letter, read by Chris, reveals that because of his father's guilt, Larry planned to commit suicide. With this final blow, Joe finally agrees to turn himself in, goes inside to get his coat but then kills himself with a gunshot. At the end, when Chris expresses remorse in spite of his resolve, Kate tells him to not blame himself and to live onward.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "At first I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> Constable Flood. If you had been, I would have roasted you in the fire." [...] Kelly asked if the police came out to shoot him. [...] "No", replied McIntyre, [...] "we came to {{apprehend}} you." [...] "What", asked Kelly, [...] "brings you out here at all?

2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry.

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the room...I was very unhappy because I had a row {{with my mother and}} very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
