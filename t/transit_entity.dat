The route also goes through small parts of Hurst and Southlake. Unlike Grapevine, those cities do not have room under the state-mandated 8.25% sales tax cap for the 1/2 cent need to join. The T will not build a station along the line in those cities unless they become a member city first.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the role of marketing in public transit organizations from a management perspective. Using a survey methodology, a national survey was conducted with a sample of 820 managers and individuals from a variety of specialized transit organizations across the United States. Twenty-three percent of the survey sample responded. Of this total, 43 percent were managers in public transit organizations, with the remainder being from a variety of specialized transit organizations. A majority of the nonmanager group was comprised of government <b>transit</b> <b>entities.</b> The findings suggest that some marketing departments are not a standard part of a transit firm’s organizational structure, and the department may be relatively small. There may be budgetary constraints also. In addition, even though the employees with marketing responsibilities are generally well educated and have several years of transportation industry experience, they may still have misperceptions about the role of marketing in the company. 17 Journal of Public Transportation, Vol. 7, No. 2, 200...|$|R
40|$|I {{remember}} {{as a young}} child being fascinated with all forms of transportation: from the Walt Disney World monorails and shuttle buses, to Busy Boats, my favorite library picture book, to my first train ride, a 20 -mile one-way trip on Amtrak that became the subject of my second-grade book fair masterpiece, The Great Day. Now, quite a number of years later, that fascination remains, manifesting itself in different ways, like getting excited when I get stopped by a passing train at a railroad crossing or riding the city bus to campus every day. Being an avid newspaper reader, I followed the long public process in the winter and spring of 2006 – 2007 as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, the public <b>transit</b> <b>entity</b> in Pittsburgh, identified ways to reduce costs to meet a multi-million dollar budget shortfall. Being a designer, {{one of the things that}} struck me was the Port Authority’s use of visuals to communicate what routes they proposed for elimination. These diagrams, one of which is shown in Figure 1, left something to be desired. It didn’t seem to communicate a clear message amidst all the visual clutter. I spent a few weeks trying out different variations and revisions of the diagram for a class in mapping and diagramming and thought that this area of design—user experience and complex information systems for transit—would be perfect for further study. In my preliminary review of current literature, I found studies of specific design improvements, such as a new bus map system in London (Horne, Roberts 2 ̆ 6 Rose, 1986), historical reviews of iconic documents such as the London Underground diagram (Garland, 1994) and surveys of current practices by organizations such as the American Public Transportation Association (2007), an industry trade group, and the Transportation Research Board (1999). However, this research focused primarily on the document or artifact in question and only tangentially on rider information needs from an abstract perspective while ignoring the user experience. This essay will present the results of my observations and thoughts about the user experience of riders in public transportation systems. I will begin by defining a public transportation system and describing its various components and integration into the city’s transportation infrastructure. In the second section, I’ll describe users of these transit systems—the riders—and offer a series of categories and characteristics we can use to understand why they use public transportation. I’ll discuss how these riders use a public transportation system in section three, by offering a five-part model for a trip. Finally, in section four, I will analyze various aspects of the physical, printed artifacts transit systems distribute to the public to communicate what services they provide...|$|E

50|$|From 1969 to 1971, the Denver Tramway Company {{continued}} service {{under the}} sponsorship of the City and County of Denver. In 1971 with aging equipment, low revenues, and lackluster ridership the Denver Tramway Company transferred all of its assets to city-owned Denver Metro Transit. As the Denver Metro <b>Transit</b> was an <b>entity</b> created by Denver, suburban service continued only for those suburbs willing to contribute a subsidy.

40|$|From a {{regional}} mobility perspective, Chicagoland {{is in serious}} trouble. The current Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) funding shortfall is just the most recent evidence of major flaws in the region's transit governance and finance structures. Over the past two decades, {{there have been numerous}} reasons and opportunities to modify the regional approach to public transportation provision. Yet the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), the area's <b>transit</b> oversight <b>entity,</b> never initiated a critical re-evaluation of its role. Ideally, the central goal of the RTA would be to enable ample transport options throughout the region. However, rather than fostering enhanced service and increased ridership levels, the RTA funding process has resulted in performance declines and has encouraged a divisive political environment. This is ultimately damaging to both the economic health and the global competitiveness of the region. Now, as Chicagoland faces a particularly severe budget crisis, it is time to finally begin the discussion that should have commenced two decades ago. The region must alter its approach to transit finance and an additional operations funding source must be identified immediately. The implementation of a region-wide, non-residential parking fee could help achieve both of these goals. When compared with the option of a sales tax increase, the advantages of a parking fee include: - It would encourage a greater sense of regionalism - It would have a rational nexus to auto mode externalities - The statutory incidence would not be on the general public and the magnitude would be minimal - It would serve as the impetus for a more merit-based approach to regional transit financeby Jodie Mercer Misiak.

40|$|Because of the {{increase}} in workplace automation and the diversification of industrial processes, workplaces have become more and more complex. The classical approaches used to address workplace hazard concerns, such as checklists or sequence models, are, therefore, of limited use in such complex systems. Moreover, because of the multifaceted nature of workplaces, the use of single-oriented methods, such as AEA (man oriented), FMEA (system oriented), or HAZOP (process oriented), is not satisfactory. The use of a dynamic modeling approach in order to allow multiple-oriented analyses may constitute an alternative to overcome this limitation. The qualitative modeling aspects of the MORM (man-machine occupational risk modeling) model are discussed in this article. The model, realized on an object-oriented Petri net tool (CO-OPN), has been developed to simulate and analyze industrial processes in an OH&S perspective. The industrial process is modeled as a set of interconnected subnets (state spaces), which describe its constitutive machines. Process-related factors are introduced, in an explicit way, through machine interconnections and flow properties. While man-machine interactions are modeled as triggering events for the state spaces of the machines, the CREAM cognitive behavior model is used in order to establish the relevant triggering events. In the CO-OPN formalism, the model is expressed as a set of interconnected CO-OPN objects defined over data types expressing the measure attached to the flow of <b>entities</b> <b>transiting</b> through the machines. Constraints on the measures assigned to these entities are used to determine the state changes in each machine. Interconnecting machines implies the composition of such flow and consequently the interconnection of the measure constraints. This is reflected by the construction of constraint enrichment hierarchies, which can be used for simulation and analysis optimization in a clear mathematical framework. The use of Petri nets to perform multiple-oriented analysis opens perspectives in the field of industrial risk management. It may significantly reduce the duration of the assessment process. But, most of all, it opens perspectives in the field of risk comparisons and integrated risk management. Moreover, because of the generic nature of the model and tool used, the same concepts and patterns may be used to model a wide range of systems and application fields...|$|R
