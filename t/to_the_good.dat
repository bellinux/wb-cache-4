5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the notable}} finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing {{the name of}} Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris {{uncovered}} in the Eshmun sanctuary.

5|$|A {{common theme}} in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} {{of what he}} regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E

5|$|As reigning champions, Liverpool {{received}} a bye {{in the first}} round, which meant that Club Brugge played two matches more to reach the final. All but one of Liverpool's matches were comfortable victories and they won each round with an aggregate score at least two goals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good.</b> In the first round Club Brugge beat Finnish champions Kuopion Palloseura by 9–2 on aggregate, but they won each of their subsequent rounds by just one goal.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock {{fans that}} {{had grown up with}} the music in the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E

5|$|Turunen {{enrolled}} in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe {{to gain a}} professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album Century Child and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{once again}} to {{domestic}} cricket, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, and this kept him in the running for {{a place in the}} national team, as he toured with The Invincibles in England in 1948. He was not selected to play in any of the Tests, however he reiterated when interviewed in 2008 that he felt no resentment over not having played. Hamence was a popular member of the touring squad and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> spirits of the team. His success in the warm up games was mixed, scores of 92, 46 and 49 not out against Cambridge University, Essex and Lancashire mixed with a duck, seven, one, three, two and five against other counties. Against Somerset, approaching his first century of the tour, the Australian players, keen to see Hamence succeed, left their card games to applaud only to see him dismissed for 99, his highest score for the season. He also faced Scotland for two matches in August 1948, scoring six and 15. Overall on the tour he played 19matches scoring 582runs at an average of 32.33.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{has always}} taught the {{intrinsic}} evil of contraception, that is, of every marital act intentionally rendered unfruitful. This teaching {{is to be}} held as definitive and irreformable. Contraception is gravely opposed to marital chastity; it is contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> of the transmission of life (the procreative aspect of matrimony), and to the reciprocal self-giving of the spouses (the unitive aspect of matrimony); it harms true love and denies the sovereign role of God in the transmission of human life.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland's Benevolence is, deliberately, {{the precise}} antithesis to the egoism of Hobbes. Cumberland {{maintained}} that the whole-hearted pursuit of the good of all contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> of each and brings personal happiness; that the opposite process involves misery to individuals including the self. Cumberland never appealed to the evidence of history, although {{he believed that the}} law of universal benevolence had been accepted by all nations and generations; and he abstains from arguments founded on revelation, feeling that it was indispensable to establish the principles of moral right on nature as a basis.|$|E
5000|$|Reclamation—Successful {{reclamation}} {{of goods}} excludes all other remedies with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> [...] A seller can reclaim goods upon demand within 20 days after buyer receives them if the seller discovers that the buyer received <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> while insolvent.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, the shipper {{has fewer}} {{obligations}} (mostly implicit), namely: (i) to pay freight; (ii) <b>to</b> pack <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> sufficiently for <b>the</b> journey; (iii) <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> honestly and accurately; (iv) not to ship dangerous cargoes (unless agreed by both parties); and (v) <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> ready for shipment as agreed; (q.v."notice of readiness to load"). None of these shippers' obligations are enforceable under the Rules; instead {{they would give}} rise to a normal action in contract.|$|R
50|$|The seller {{delivers}} when <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> {{are placed}} alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that <b>the</b> buyer has <b>to</b> bear all costs and risks {{of loss of}} or damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> from that moment. The FAS term requires <b>the</b> seller <b>to</b> clear <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required <b>the</b> buyer <b>to</b> arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish <b>the</b> buyer <b>to</b> clear <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.|$|R
