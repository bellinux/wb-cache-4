25|$|Characters U+0800 through U+FFFF use three bytes in UTF-8, {{but only}} two in UTF-16. As a result, text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> these {{characters}} than there are ASCII characters. This is possible when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by {{the degree to which}} the context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Arab dirhams {{discovered}} {{on the island}} of Gotland alone is astoundingly high. In the various hoards located around the island, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> these silver coins than at any other site in Western Eurasia. The total sum is almost as great as the number that has been unearthed in the entire Muslim world. These coins moved north through trade between Rus merchants and the Abbasid Caliphate, along the Silver-Fur Road, and the money made by Scandinavian merchants would help northern Europe, especially Viking Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire, as major commercial centers for the next several centuries.|$|E
500|$|Dickinson was {{familiar}} {{not only with}} the Bible but also with contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by Lydia Maria Child's Letters from New York, another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed [...] "This then is a book! And <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them!"). Her brother smuggled a copy of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Kavanagh into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre in late 1849. Jane Eyres influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a Newfoundland, she named him [...] "Carlo" [...] after the character St. John Rivers' dog. William Shakespeare was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, [...] "Why clasp any hand but this?" [...] and to another, [...] "Why is any other book needed?" ...|$|E

40|$|In British {{disability}} politics, {{the disability}} movement has sponsored the social model approach to disability studies, which challenges the psychological model that individualizes disability & the medical model that pathologizes it. However, the social {{model has been}} internally critiqued {{to the detriment of}} the movement. It is recommended that energy be directed instead toward theoretically uniting those in disability studies in the social sciences so that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an impact on policy...|$|R
50|$|Because the {{operating}} system and applications all shared a single memory space, {{it was possible for}} a bug in any one of them to corrupt the entire operating system, and crash the machine. This was not particularly annoying under a single-application model, in which case the application crashed anyway. But under MultiFinder, a crash would crash all the other running programs, as well. Because <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them running, the chance of a crash was higher.|$|R

60|$|Their forts were earthworks, {{but they}} were skillfully planned, with a {{knowledge}} which no savage race has shown.

They are on a far grander scale than the supposed temples or religious works; and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them than of all the other ruins, except the small detached mounds, which are almost numberless.|$|E
6000|$|Presently I {{talked to}} the Staff Officer, who chanced {{to be a friend}} of mine, and chanced, besides, to be a man with a {{capacity}} for sustained thought, an eye for country, and some imagination. He said: 'I don't like the situation; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them than we expected. We have come down off our high ground. We have taken all the big guns off the big hills. We are getting ourselves cramped up among these kopjes in the valley of the Tugela. It will be like being in the Coliseum and shot at by every row of seats.' ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{big part}} of the {{products}} are beans (black beans and kidney beans). Their presentations can be as whole, refried and shattered beans. Some of them can be also mixed with chorizo, cheese, chipotle and pork rinds, finally the beans can be already prepared from traditional recipes as the frijoles charros or sauce for enfrijoladas (similar to enchiladas).

50|$|Gérard Houllier saw his Liverpool side finish {{second in}} the table, one better than he predicted; it was their highest {{position}} since 1991.
