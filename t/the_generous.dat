In 1079, there was an anti-Bolesław conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Kraków. Bolesław had Bishop Stanisław of Szczepanów executed; subsequently Bolesław was forced to abdicate the Polish throne due to pressure from the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. Stanisław would become the second martyr and patron saint of Poland (known in English as St. Stanislav), canonized in 1253.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that <b>the</b> <b>generous</b> benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} vexilloids (flag-like objects) used in Poland {{were known}} as stanice and probably resembled the Roman vexillum, that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or spear.

5|$|Charles had won {{one of his}} {{greatest}} victories at Grodno 1706, by simply cutting off his opponents' resources and supplies. Later, {{in a letter to}} his ally Frederick IV of Denmark, Peter I confirmed losses of up to 17,000 men during the encirclement and retreat. After his pursuit of the Russian army, having chased them out of Lithuania, Charles saw his opportunity to march back to Poland in order to meet up with Rehnskiöld, in preparation for the invasion of Saxony. He arrived there in August 5. Meanwhile, Schulenburg did what he could in an attempt to increase the Saxon army to measure the expected invasion from the Swedes, something which was proven close to impossible after the battle of Fraustadt. In a last attempt to stop the invasion, Augustus II of Saxony offered Courland to Sweden and Lithuania to the newly crowned king Stanisław I of Poland. <b>The</b> <b>generous</b> offer was, however denied by Charles who crossed the Saxon border in September 5. As Saxony was close to defenseless, the Swedes could easily push away any resisting troops. In September 19, they occupied the city of Leipzig which finally forced Augustus into unconditional peace under Swedish terms. Among other things, the traitor and second principal behind the Grodno campaign, Johann Patkul was turned into Swedish custody.|$|E
5|$|While the Swedish {{policy was}} to avoid war and to {{consolidate}} its gains, Danish policy after 1660 was {{to seek an}} opportunity to regain its losses. Under the Oldenburg King Frederick III, the foreign policy was aimed at isolating Sweden while setting itself up in a favorable position in future wars. Denmark attempted to position itself in the alliances among the 17th century Europe great powers. Bourbon France and the Habsburg-dominated Holy Roman Empire competed for continental domination while the Dutch Republic and England fought several wars over naval hegemony. At the same time, Denmark sought to rid itself of <b>the</b> <b>generous</b> toll treaties it was forced to grant Dutch merchants after the Republic's assistance in the wars against Sweden. Attempts were made to ally with both England and France, but without success. In the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–66) Denmark had {{to side with the}} Dutch at the Battle of Vågen, souring its relations with England. In 1670 France allied with England against the Republic. Sweden's relations with France had improved greatly and in 1672 it joined the Anglo-French coalition, pushing Denmark into the Dutch camp.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, <b>the</b> <b>generous</b> donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E
