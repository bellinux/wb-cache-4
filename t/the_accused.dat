This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> persons but not the officers, as this may infringe <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
