30|$|A hybrid {{intrusion}} detection method based on hidden Markov model (HMM) and fuzzy logic {{has been proposed}} by Li et al. [52]. The experimental results showed that their method is efficient to classify <b>the</b> anomaly <b>profile</b> from <b>the</b> normal <b>profile.</b> Comparing with other methods based on the HMM only, this HMM- and fuzzy logic-based method has the following advantages: first, it needs only less storage without <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> database. With <b>the</b> processes being used by more and more users, <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> database will be greatly enlarged. So, <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> database would occupy much storage with the larger and larger profile database; second, it could reduce training time effectively, which needed less testing data. When <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> databases are very large, the detection speed is slower as the sequence must be compared with all the records in <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> database. Their approach detects network-based attacks only at high false-positive rates as the processes in those attack scenarios behave similar to the normal behavior.|$|R
