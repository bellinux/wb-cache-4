5|$|The bridge's Whipple <b>truss</b> {{technology}} {{was developed by}} civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's <b>truss</b> design in 1859 by designing the first <b>truss</b> bridge with pinned eyebar connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy <b>truss</b> bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge and its oldest extant metal <b>truss</b> bridge.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's Whipple <b>truss</b> {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's <b>truss</b> bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt <b>truss,</b> thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two <b>truss</b> bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's <b>truss</b> design in 1859 when he designed the first <b>truss</b> bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of <b>truss</b> bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected <b>truss</b> bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's <b>truss</b> design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple <b>truss</b> {{bridge over the}} South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple <b>truss</b> span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised <b>truss</b> span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple <b>truss</b> span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western <b>truss</b> span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E
40|$|<b>Trussed</b> beam {{with the}} 46 m span was {{considered}} {{as an object}} of investigations. Pultrusion composite profiles and steel cables were considered as the materials of the <b>trussed</b> beam top chord, web and bottom chord, correspondingly. <b>Trussed</b> beam with strut frames, <b>trussed</b> beam with triangular web and <b>trussed</b> beam with vertical struts were compared {{from the point of view}} of maximum vertical displacements. The <b>trussed</b> beam with vertical struts is characterized by the increased deformability in case if the load is uniformly distributed by the half of the span. It was shown, that the application of additional diagonals allows to decrease the deformability of <b>trussed</b> beam with vertical struts. The dependence of load-bearing capacity on construction height and material consumption was obtained for the <b>trussed</b> beam with vertical struts with the 46 m span. It was shown, that load-bearing capacity of <b>trussed</b> beam changes within the limits from 11. 4 to 26. 1 kN/m when the height of the <b>trussed</b> beam changes from 3 to 7 m, correspondingly. The materials consumption changes within the limits from 1705 to 2516 kg at the same time...|$|R

5|$|The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge was {{originally}} constructed in 1874 {{as part of}} the South Branch Bridge (or alternatively, the Romney Bridge), a larger two-span Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge conveying the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) across the South Branch Potomac River near Romney. The larger Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge replaced an 1838 wooden covered bridge that was destroyed during the American Civil War. In 1874, T. B. White and Sons were charged with the construction of a Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge over the South Branch; that bridge served travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years until a new bridge was constructed in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{technological}} design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, {{in addition}} to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron <b>truss</b> bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy <b>truss</b> bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At {{the time of the}} bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal <b>truss</b> bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the <b>truss</b> materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal <b>truss</b> bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Dismantled in 1937, {{the bridge}} was {{relocated}} to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to carry Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. The bridge was dedicated on August 20, 1938. In 1991, a new bridge was completed to the south, and the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge was preserved {{in place by the}} West Virginia Division of Highways, due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance. The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 2011.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the optimal location selection of actuators for vibration control in prestressed adaptive <b>trusses.</b> Since prestressed adaptive <b>trusses</b> are statically indeterminate, the actuators {{to be used}} for vibration control purposes must work against (1) existing static axial prestressing forces, (2) static axial forces caused by the actuation, and (3) dynamic axial forces caused by the motion of the mass. In statically determinate adaptive <b>trusses</b> (1) and (2) are non - existing. The actuator placement problem in statically indeterminate <b>trusses</b> is therefore governed by the actuation energy and the actuator strength requirements. Assuming output feedback type control of selected vibration modes in autonomous systems, a procedure is given for the placement of vibration controlling actuators in prestressed adaptive <b>trusses...</b>|$|R
