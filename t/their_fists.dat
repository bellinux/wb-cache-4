5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient, so a water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell. Water came from the town's own source, with many houses losing their supply. On Mondays, housewives were known to shake <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> at engine drivers when their weekly wash was interrupted. Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their feet in line and <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly {{in front of the other}} and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|E

25|$|Modern boxers can {{sometimes}} be seen tapping their cheeks or foreheads with <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> in order to remind themselves to keep their hands up (which becomes difficult during long bouts). Boxers are taught to push off with their feet {{in order to move}} effectively. Forward motion involves lifting the lead leg and pushing with the rear leg. Rearward motion involves lifting the rear leg and pushing with the lead leg. During lateral motion the leg {{in the direction of the}} movement moves first while the opposite leg provides the force needed to move the body.|$|E
25|$|When {{the order}} Na shturm, marshch! (Assault, march!) was given, the Soviet {{infantry}} would charge the enemy with shouting the traditional Russian battle cry Urra! (pronounced oo-rah, {{which comes from}} the Turkish word to kill), the sound of which many German veterans found terrifying. During the charge, the riflemen would fire with rifles and submachine guns while throwing grenades before closing in for blizhnii boi (close combat) as close quarter fighting with guns, bayonets, rifle butts, knives, digging tools and <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> were known, a type of fighting that the Red Army excelled at. On the defensive, the frontovik were well known for their skill at camouflaging their positions and for being disciplined enough to withhold fire until the Germans were at close range. Before 1941 Red Army doctrine had called for opening fire at maximum range, but it was quickly discovered that it was preferable to ambush the Germans with surprise fire at close ranges from multiple positions.|$|E

25|$|Boxing was {{a popular}} spectator sport in Ancient Rome. In order for the fighters to protect {{themselves}} against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around <b>their</b> <b>fists.</b> Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer'). Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against {{one another in a}} circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.|$|E
25|$|Boxing (musti-yuddha) is {{traditionally}} considered the roughest form of South Asian unarmed combat. In ancient {{times it was}} popular throughout what are now Pakistan and northern India, but is rarely practiced today. Boxers harden <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> by striking stone and other hard objects. Matches may be either one-on-one or group fights. All kinds of strikes and grabs are allowed, and {{any part of the}} body may be targeted except the groin. Another form of boxing was loh-musti (meaning “iron fist”), said to have been practiced by the God Krishna. In this variation, boxers fought while wielding a kara or steel bracelet like a knuckleduster. Grabs, kicks, biting and attacks to the groin were all legal, the only prohibition being spitting on the opponent which was considered crude and dishonourable. The kara used for regular matches was unadorned, but the form employed during war had one or more spikes around its edge. The kara may be paired with one on each hand, but it was generally only worn on one hand so the other hand could be left free. In some cases the free hand could be paired with another weapon, most commonly the bagh nakha.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, the Shinyō Maru was sailing for Manila in convoy C-076 {{with seven}} other vessels, {{including}} two torpedo boats, two tankers, {{and four other}} medium and small cargo ships. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of Zamboanga Peninsula {{on the island of}} Mindanao, when the USS Paddle found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the Shinyō Maru to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned Paddle to search for it. The Paddle, under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released {{in the direction of the}} Shinyō Maru, which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and a few moments later the Paddle was lined up against one of the cargo ships. It, too, was struck by two torpedoes, so her commander grounded her on the nearby shore to prevent the ship from sinking. Just after the Shinyō Maru was hit, the guards opened fire on the prisoners with captured Thompson submachine guns, though several of the men fought their way out of the hold, with <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> and improvised weapons, and abandoned ship.|$|E

50|$|The finger gun is a hand gesture {{in which}} the subject uses their hand to mimic a handgun, raising their thumb above <b>their</b> <b>fist</b> {{to act as a}} hammer, and one or two fingers {{extended}} perpendicular to it acting as a barrel.

500|$|Rome's critics gave Il trittico {{as a whole}} {{a warmer}} reception, but still saw Gianni Schicchi as {{the best of the}} three. Alberto Gasco in La tribuna noted, [...] "In terms of {{harmonic}} technique, Il tabarro and Schicchi advance quite startling elements of novelty. Nothing that contemporary art has produced escapes the studious and astute Giacomo Puccini." [...] Gasco also stated that while many critics were waiting for the first two operas with <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> drawn, Gianni Schicchi disarmed these [...] "hired assassins" [...] with a [...] "single glance". An anonymous reviewer in L'idea nazionale felt that the three works comprised a unified whole, but feared that Puccini was becoming less inventive. L'idea nazionale was a nationalist newspaper, and praised Puccini for returning to an Italian subject [...] "after so many useless Japanese, American, Parisian digressions".|$|E
500|$|There were racial {{tensions}} between black US athletes and their white counterparts; in one incident, African Americans blocked whites from the track. One black runner, Tommie Smith, told writers on October 15, [...] "I don't want Brundage presenting me any medals". The following day, Smith won the 200 meters, and fellow African-American John Carlos took the bronze medal. The two men, after receiving their medals from IAAF president Lord Exeter, and as [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] played, raised black-gloved fists, heads down, in salute of black power. Although the USOC initially only reprimanded the two men, {{under pressure from}} the IOC, two days after the race it suspended them from the team and expelled them from the Olympic Village. Other demonstrations by African-Americans also took place: the three African Americans who took the medals in the 400 meters race, led by gold medalist Lee Evans, wore black berets during the anthem (they were not disciplined by the USOC) while African-American boxer George Foreman, triumphant in the heavyweight division, waved an American flag around the boxing ring and with fellow American boxers invited Brundage to their victory celebration. Brundage's comment about the Smith-Carlos incident was [...] "Warped mentalities and cracked personalities seem to be everywhere and impossible to eliminate." [...] The USOC's official report omits the iconic photograph of Smith and Carlos with <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> raised; the local organizing committee's official film showed footage of the ceremony. Brundage, who termed the incident [...] "the nasty demonstration against the American flag by negroes", objected in vain to its inclusion.|$|E
500|$|Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a two and {{half out of}} four stars saying, [...] "Who knew that the franchise's creators would {{eventually}} find a plot twist that made sense? Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with <b>their</b> <b>fists</b> in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once you get past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E

500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the time. We do. I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking <b>their</b> <b>fists.</b> After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E
