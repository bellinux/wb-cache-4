5|$|El Greco painted {{many of his}} {{paintings}} on fine canvas and employed a viscous oil medium. He painted with the usual pigments of his period such as azurite, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, madder lake, ochres and red lead, but he seldom used <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> natural ultramarine.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology {{used by the}} Soviet Army during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E

30|$|Table  5 {{shows the}} cost per barrel for each {{formulation}}. It shows that <b>the</b> least <b>expensive</b> salt-containing formulation is 3.5  ppb sodium chloride at USD 10.85. <b>The</b> most <b>expensive</b> formulation is <b>the</b> 17.5  ppb potassium chloride at USD 22.05 {{which is more than}} double in cost compared to the former. Generally, <b>the</b> least <b>expensive</b> salt is sodium chloride followed by calcium chloride with potassium chloride being <b>the</b> most <b>expensive.</b> This is illustrated in Table  5 as it shows that typically, the formulations with higher concentrations of potassium chloride are <b>the</b> most <b>expensive</b> while those containing more sodium chloride are <b>the</b> least <b>expensive.</b> Intuitively, <b>the</b> higher concentration of any salt reflects a higher cost.|$|R
5000|$|Dick Tracy Returns was budgeted at $156,991 {{although}} the final negative cost was $170,940 (a $13,949, or 8.9%, overspend). It was <b>the</b> most <b>expensive</b> Republic serial of 1938 and <b>the</b> most <b>expensive</b> Republic serial until The Lone Ranger Rides Again in 1939. [...] It was <b>the</b> second most <b>expensive</b> of <b>the</b> four Dick Tracy serials (<b>the</b> most <b>expensive</b> was <b>the</b> last, Dick Tracy vs Crime Inc at $175,919).|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} these Greek re-conquests, Michael VIII {{was forced to}} levy crushing taxes on the Anatolian peasantry {{in order to pay}} for <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> army that modeled around the Komnenian army. This led to much peasant support for the Turks whose system resulted in fewer taxes initially.|$|E
5|$|The {{near-miss}} and collision incidents presented further safety issues. Both {{were caused}} by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual docking system, which was undergoing tests at the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> Kurs automatic docking system from the Progress ships.|$|E
5|$|Uranium and osmium were early {{successful}} catalysts in the Haber process, {{the nitrogen}} fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia, giving enough yield {{to make the}} process economically successful. At the time, a group at BASF led by Carl Bosch bought most of the world's supply of osmium {{to use as a}} catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants, removing the need for <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> and rare osmium.|$|E

5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was a feature of the same dome. <b>The</b> <b>expensive</b> and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while their wages remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Keenor had a keen {{interest}} in football, using tennis balls or rags tied together to form a ball, due to <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> nature of footballs at the time, to play the game in his local streets. He attended Stacey Road primary school in Adamsdown and captained the school's football team for several years and he was later selected to represent the city of Cardiff's schoolboy team. One of his former teachers at the school, Walter Riden, would later go on to join the board at Cardiff City while Keenor was a player.|$|E

50|$|The Kalverstraat is <b>the</b> most <b>expensive</b> {{shopping}} {{street in the}} Netherlands, with rents of up to 3000 euros per square meter (2016).

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, {{so did the}} Whig administration. The {{impeachment}} of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for questioning the Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} the government in <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As {{a result of his}} efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E
5|$|German war cemeteries are {{somewhat}} different from French and British ones, being more austere and simple in design. They were built around lawns, without flowers or other decorations, intended to highlight {{acceptance of the}} tragedy and avoid <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> and pretentious sentimentality that the German VDK felt Allied cemeteries invoked. German war cemeteries also included heldenhaine, heroes' groves populated with oak trees and large boulders, dolmen. Both symbolising nature; this landscaping {{was considered to be}} particularly important for German war cemeteries. The cemeteries used slate grave markers, less individualised than British or French equivalents, and felt to better symbolise the importance German nation as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Robert Selbie was {{appointed}} Secretary of the Metropolitan Railway, {{working on the}} electrification of the London sections of the line; by 1905 the route was electrified as far as Harrow, although the sections north of Harrow, including the Chesham branch, continued to be worked by steam power. In 1908 he {{was appointed}} General Manager, a position he was to hold until 1930. Selbie realised that Watkin's schemes and <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> electrification project had left the company with major financial liabilities, and that the MR's core business in central London would come under significant pressure {{as the use of}} automobiles increased and as the new Underground Electric Railways of London tube lines improved their services. Selbie set out to reshape the MR as a feeder route for goods and passengers into London.|$|E

5|$|Jeunet hired French {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, {{both of whom}} he had worked with on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and Alien films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, {{the game}} utilises the same Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) {{rendering}} technology. Pre-rendered images are modelled as 3D objects and then transformed into 2D sprites and background layers. Rare founder Tim Stamper served {{as director of}} the game, whereas his colleague Brendan Gunn, who had worked on the original, returned to design the game. Development of Diddy's Kong Quest began shortly after the release of its predecessor. Rare took significant financial risks in purchasing <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> SGI equipment used to render the graphics. David Wise, Rare's composer from 1985 to 1994, admitted that the workstations Rare purchased were worth £80,000 each. A new compression technique they developed allowed them to incorporate more detail and animation for each sprite for a given memory footprint than previously achieved on the SNES, which better captured the pre-rendered graphics.|$|E
5|$|The game uses LaserDisc {{technology}} to stream pre-recorded animation, which {{was produced by}} Japanese studio Toei Animation. The game features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and amplified monaural sound. The protagonist's appearance was possibly derived from the main character, Lum, from the Japanese manga and anime series Urusei Yatsura. Several factors prevented an overseas release: {{a decline in the}} popularity of laserdisc arcade games in the mid-80s, <b>the</b> <b>expensive</b> price of laserdisc technology, and difficulty to translate. In the original Japanese Reika is voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto.|$|E
