After the war, he involved himself in both <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> cultural life of Greater Romania.

5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it {{also was}} where he came to mature socially. Here he began to cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> social issues facing South Africa.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} the Soviet Union was assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev. The {{worsening}} economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev {{to carry out a}} number of reforms, not only in the field of economics (uskoreniye) but in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> social realms (glasnost and perestroika). Gorbachev's policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of Soviet satellites, including the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E

He made his first short film in 1959 as a student at the Hungarian Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts, and his first feature film in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could {{be traced to the}} prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> social consequences of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Crusades in general, and {{particularly}} that of the First Crusade, is widely debated among historians. The confusion is partially due to the numerous armies in the first crusade, and their lack of direct unity. The similar ideologies held the armies to similar goals, but the connections were rarely strong, and the unity broke down often. The Crusades are most commonly linked to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> social situation in 11th-century Europe, {{the rise of a}} reform movement within the papacy, and <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> religious confrontation of Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Christianity had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in Late Antiquity, but by the early 8th century Christian rule had become limited to Europe and Anatolia after the Muslim conquests.|$|E

5|$|The {{philosophical}} {{nature of}} the character has invited political critiques, and resulted in comparisons drawn against <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> philosophical views of other fictional characters.

5|$|The primary {{theme of}} the story is the {{conflict}} between anarchism and statism, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> ethical dimensions of which are explored through the characters' dialogue. Though the attention the story received was limited prior to the author's death in 1982, it has since seen greater circulation in Philip K. Dick story collections, and has been reviewed and analyzed for its postmodern critique of technology and its political implications.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Philippe Leymarie, the French crushing of the Uprising {{resulted in}} the near annihilation of the managerial class in Madagascar, with consequences that continued to reverberate for decades after the country's independence. Many of the leading figures in the Uprising went on to dramatically shape <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> social landscape of Madagascar after independence. Monja Jaona, who was jailed by the French for nine years, founded the Madagascar for the Malagasy Party (MONIMA) in 1958 shortly after his release. His party was key in leading the rotaka peasant uprising against President Philibert Tsiranana which brought down his neo-colonial administration the following year. After initially supporting Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, Tsiranana's successor, in 1992 Jaona led demonstrations against it and in favor of federalism, being severely wounded in the process. His son, Monja Roindefo, is also {{an active member of}} MONIMA and served as Prime Minister under Andry Rajoelina.|$|E
