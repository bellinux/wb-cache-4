5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough <b>to</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year.

Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines with coffee, and returned <b>to</b> <b>pitch.</b> <b>In</b> August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups. The Pirates {{told him not to}} wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted a spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired by the hair curlers.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} to perform well {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis <b>to</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E

After being included in a trade to the Twins for Johan Santana, Humber struggled to establish himself.

With Nashville, he had a 52 record and 2.05 ERA in nine appearances. Wever's pitching coach in Nashville was Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the confidence <b>to</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the majors, and spent his time in Nashville working on that aspect of Wever's game. The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All-Star team, thanks to 11 wins and 116 strikeouts {{through the end of}} June. He improved to a 16-6 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 191 strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Wever up to the major leagues.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in <b>to</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> relief in the final game of the year so that Giants' fans could give him a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} sixth {{straight}} opening day start in 2016 as the Dodgers won 15–0.

He picked up his 100th strikeout on May 29, while only walking five batters within that period. That was the lowest walk total for a pitcher reaching 100 strikeouts in the modern era, beating Cliff Lee who had seven walks in the 2010 season. On June 30, 2016, Kershaw was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to back pain. He received an MRI, which revealed that there was a mild herniated disc in the back, and received an epidural injection to treat the pain. He was named to the 2016 All-Star team but was unable <b>to</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> the game due to his injury. On July 20, the Dodgers shut down Kershaw for an indefinite period of time.
