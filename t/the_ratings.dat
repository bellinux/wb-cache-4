40|$|Abstract. In two experiments, we {{explored}} whether compositions {{made up of}} two or three rectangles received high aesthetics <b>ratings</b> when <b>the</b> composition was equilibrated, that is, when the center of mass of the weights represented by the areas of the rectangles were {{in the center of the}} composition. We supposed that equilibrated stimuli might be appreciated as much as symmetric stimuli. We further wanted to find out whether aesthetics ratings, balance ratings, and weight ratings differ from each other, and which stimulus characteristics influence each rating. We observed that the position of the center of mass of the compositions influenced <b>the</b> aesthetics <b>ratings</b> only slightly whereas it influenced <b>the</b> weight <b>ratings</b> more strongly. In contrast with this, the variation of the overall shape of the rectangles making up the compositions influenced <b>the</b> aesthetics <b>ratings</b> more strongly than <b>the</b> weight <b>ratings.</b> At first sight, balance ratings appeared intermediate between <b>the</b> aesthetics <b>ratings</b> and <b>the</b> weight <b>ratings.</b> However, when we varied the area ratio of the rectangles making up the composition, we observed that <b>the</b> balance <b>ratings</b> were independent of <b>the</b> two other <b>ratings...</b>|$|R
