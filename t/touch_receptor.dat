40|$|Abstract Background The Caenorhabditis elegans gene mec- 3 encodes a LIM-homeodomain {{protein that}} is a master {{regulator}} of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron genes. Two of the touch neurons, the ALM neurons, are generated in the anterior of the animal and then migrate to near {{the middle of the}} animal. In animals transformed with a sequence upstream of mec- 3, the ALM <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons failed to migrate to their normal positions and sometimes migrated in the wrong direction, and the PLM <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons showed axonal defects. Here we characterize this effect and identify the sequence causing the cell migration and axonal defects. Results The ALM migration defect did not result from RNA interference (RNAi), nonspecific effects of carrying a transgenic array, expression of GFP, or the marker gene used to make the transformants. Instead, the ALM migration defect resulted from transgenic arrays containing many copies of a specific 104 bp DNA sequence. Transgenic arrays containing this sequence did not affect all cell migrations. Conclusions The mec- 3 upstream sequence appeared to be sequestering (titrating out) a specific DNA-binding factor that is required for the ALMs to migrate correctly. Because titration of this factor could reverse the direction of ALM migrations, it may be part of a program that specifies both the direction and extent of ALM migrations. mec- 3 is a master regulator of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron genes, so the factor or factors that bind this sequence may also be involved in specifying the fate of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons. </p...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 While aging impacts most, if not all, living organisms, the {{molecular}} mechanisms behind this phenomenon {{are not completely}} understood. Here, I aimed to further describe the intricate relationship between genetics and diet in aging, focusing on <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron aging processes in the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. I specifically tested the hypotheses that (1) age-related <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron morphological changes are associated with whole organism health, (2) intrinsic (i. e. genetic) and extrinsic (i. e. nutritional) factors can influence these morphological changes, and (3) specific cellular signaling processes underlie these morphological changes. To this end, this dissertation has three components: (1) the impact of insulin signaling disruption on neuron morphology and protein aggregation in a model of Huntington’s Disease; (2) establishment of Alaskan nutraceutical treatments that extend lifespan and offset age-related decline in neuron and whole organism health; and (3) description of mechanisms driving Alaskan nutraceutical treatment effects using RNA sequencing to target subsequent experiments. In {{all three of these}} components, I measured markers of whole organism health (e. g. lifespan, motility, endogenous reactive oxygen species) and markers of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron health (e. g. neuron morphology, mechanosensation). Together, this dissertation demonstrated that lifespan-extending interventions (e. g. decreased insulin signaling, Alaskan nutraceutical treatments) improved mechanosensation and, interestingly, differentially modulated development of age-related neuron morphological changes. That beneficial treatments increased the occurrence of posterior neuron process branching and/or decreased the occurrence of several anterior cell soma morphologies (e. g. soma outgrowths) suggests that some morphologies are representative of successful defense of the cell against age-related deterioration, while others are markers of cellular dysfunction. These results support the idea that multiple cellular signaling pathways are involved in aging of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons, and thus, there are multiple mechanisms for promoting health with age at the cellular level...|$|E

40|$|Microtubules are {{integral}} to neuronal development and function. They endow cells with polarity, shape, and structure, and their extensive surface area provides substrates for intracellular trafficking and scaffolds for signaling molecules. Consequently, microtubule polymerization dynamics affect not only structural {{features of the}} cell but also the subcellular localization of proteins that can trigger intracellular signaling events. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the processes of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons are filled with a bundle of specialized large-diameter microtubules. We find that conditions that disrupt these microtubules (loss of either the MEC- 7 β-tubulin or MEC- 12 α-tubulin or growth in 1 mM colchicine) cause a general reduction in <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron (TRN) protein levels. This reduction requires a p 38 MAPK pathway (DLK- 1, MKK- 4, and PMK- 3) and the transcription factor CEBP- 1.

40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans DEG/ENaC {{proteins}} MEC- 4 and MEC- 10 transduce gentle touch {{in the six}} <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons. Gain-of-function mutations of mec- 4 and mec- 4 (d) {{result in}} a hyperactive channel and neurodegeneration in vivo. Loss of MEC- 6, a putative DEG/ENaC-specific chaperone, and of the similar protein POML- 1 suppresses the neurodegeneration caused by a mec- 4 (d) mutation. We find that mutation of two genes, mec- 10 and a new gene mec- 19 (previously named C 49 G 9. 1), prevents this action of POML- 1, allowing the <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons to die in poml- 1 mec- 4 (d) animals. The proteins encoded by these genes normally inhibit mec- 4 (d) neurotoxicity through different mechanisms. MEC- 10, a subunit of the mechanosensory transduction channel with MEC- 4, inhibits MEC- 4 (d) activity without affecting MEC- 4 expression.

40|$|In most {{eukaryotic}} cells, subsets of microtubules are {{adapted for}} specific functions by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin subunits. Acetylation of the ε-amino group of K 40 on α-tubulin is a conserved PTM on the luminal side of microtubules 1 that {{was discovered in}} the flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 2, 3. Studies on the significance of microtubule acetylation have been limited by the undefined status of the α-tubulin acetyltransferase. Here, we show that MEC- 17, a protein related to the Gcn 5 histone acetyltransferases 4 and required for the function of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons in C. elegans 5, 6, acts as a K 40 -specific acetyltransferase for α-tubulin. In vitro, MEC- 17 exclusively acetylates K 40 of α-tubulin. Disruption of the Tetrahymena MEC- 17 gene phenocopies the K 40 R α-tubulin mutation and makes microtubules more labile. Depletion of MEC- 17 in zebrafish produces phenotypes consistent with neuromuscular defects. In C. elegans, MEC- 17 and its paralog W 06 B 11. 1 are redundantly required for acetylation of MEC- 12 α-tubulin, {{and contribute to the}} function of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons partly via MEC- 12 acetylation and partly via another function, possibly by acetylating another protein. In summary, we identify MEC- 17 as an enzyme that acetylates the K 40 residue of α-tubulin, the only PTM known to occur on the luminal surface of microtubules...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{founding}} member of the EMAP-like protein family is the Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein (EMAP), so-named for its abundance in sea urchin, starfish, and sand dollar eggs. The EMAP-like protein family has five members in mammals (EML 1 through EML 5) and only one in both Drosophila (ELP- 1) and C. elegans (ELP- 1). Biochemical studies of sea urchin EMAP and vertebrate EMLs implicate these proteins in the regulation of microtubule stability. So far, however, the physiological function of this protein family remains unknown. Results We examined the expression pattern of C. elegans ELP- 1 by means of transgenic gene expression in living embryos and adults, and by immunolocalization with an ELP- 1 -specific antibody in fixed tissues. In embryos, ELP- 1 is expressed in the hypodermis. In larvae and adults, ELP- 1 is expressed in the body wall, spermatheca and vulval muscles, intestine, and hypodermal seam cells. In muscle, ELP- 1 is associated with adhesion complexes near the cell surface and is bound to a criss-crossing network of microtubules in the cytoplasm. ELP- 1 is also expressed in a subset of mechanoreceptor neurons, including the ray neurons in the male tail, microtubule-rich <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons, and the six ciliated IL 1 neurons. This restricted localization in the nervous system implies that ELP- 1 plays a role in mechanotransmission. Consistent with this idea, decreasing ELP- 1 expression decreases sensitivity to gentle touch applied to the body wall. Conclusion These data imply that ELP- 1 may play an important role during the transmission of forces and signals between the body surface and both muscle cells and <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons. </p...|$|E

50|$|In {{a regular}} visual system, the data {{collected}} by the retina is converted into an electrical stimulus in the optic nerve and relayed to the brain, which re-creates the image and perceives it. Because it is the brain {{that is responsible for}} the final perception, sensory substitution is possible. During sensory substitution an intact sensory modality relays information to the visual perception areas of the brain so that the person can perceive to see. With sensory substitution, information gained from one sensory modality can reach brain structures physiologically related to other sensory modalities. Touch-to-visual sensory substitution transfers information from <b>touch</b> <b>receptors</b> to the visual cortex for interpretation and perception. For example, through fMRI, we can determine which parts of the brain are activated during sensory perception. In blind persons, we can see that while they are only receiving tactile information, their visual cortex is also activated as they perceive to see objects. We can also have touch to touch sensory substitution where information from <b>touch</b> <b>receptors</b> of one region can be used to perceive touch in another region.

40|$|Sensory loss induces cross-modal plasticity, often {{resulting}} in altered performance in remaining sensory modalities. Whereas much {{is known about}} the macroscopic mechanisms underlying cross-modal plasticity, only scant information exists about its cellular and molecular underpinnings. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes deprived of a sense of body touch exhibit various changes in behavior, associated with other unimpaired senses. We focused on one such behavioral alteration, enhanced odor sensation, and sought to reveal the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that translate mechanosensory loss into improved olfactory acuity. To this end, we analyzed in mechanosensory mutants food-dependent locomotion patterns that are associated with olfactory responses and found changes that are consistent with enhanced olfaction. The altered locomotion could be reversed in adults by optogenetic stimulation of the <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> (mechanosensory) neurons. Furthermore, we revealed that the enhanced odor response is related to a strengthening of inhibitory AWC→AIY synaptic transmission in the olfactory circuit. Consistently, inserting in this circuit an engineered electrical synapse that diminishes AWC inhibition of AIY counteracted the locomotion changes in touch-deficient mutants. We found that this cross-modal signaling between the mechanosensory and olfactory circuits is mediated by neuropeptides, one of which we identified as FLP- 20. Our results indicate that under normal function, ongoing <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neuron activation evokes FLP- 20 release, suppressing synaptic communication and thus dampening odor sensation. In contrast, in the absence of mechanosensory input, FLP- 20 signaling is reduced, synaptic suppression is released, and this enables enhanced olfactory acuity; these changes are long lasting and do not represent ongoing modulation, as revealed by optogenetic experiments. Our work adds to a growing literature on the roles of neuropeptides in cross-modal signaling, by showing how activity-dependent neuropeptide signaling leads to specific cross-modal plastic changes in neural circuit connectivity, enhancing sensory performance.

40|$|SummaryHow {{metazoan}} mechanotransduction channels sense mechanical stimuli is {{not well}} understood. The NOMPC channel in the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, a mechanotransduction channel for Drosophila touch sensation and hearing, contains 29 Ankyrin repeats (ARs) that associate with microtubules. These ARs have been postulated to act as a tether that conveys force to the channel. Here, we report that these N-terminal ARs form a cytoplasmic domain essential for NOMPC mechanogating in vitro, mechanosensitivity of <b>touch</b> <b>receptor</b> neurons in vivo, and touch-induced behaviors of Drosophila larvae. Duplicating the ARs elongates the filaments that tether NOMPC to microtubules in mechanosensory neurons. Moreover, microtubule association is required for NOMPC mechanogating. Importantly, transferring the NOMPC ARs to mechanoinsensitive voltage-gated potassium channels confers mechanosensitivity to the chimeric channels. These experiments strongly support a tether mechanism of mechanogating for the NOMPC channel, providing insights into the basis of mechanosensitivity of mechanotransduction channels...|$|E
