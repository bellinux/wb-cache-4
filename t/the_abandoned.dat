5|$|Crawford's {{officers}} held {{a council}} of war. Some argued <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> village {{proved that the}} Indians knew about the expedition and were concentrating their forces elsewhere. Others expressed the desire to call off the expedition and return home immediately. Williamson asked for permission to take 50 men and burn <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> village, but Crawford refused as he {{did not wish to}} divide his forces. The council decided to continue the march {{for the rest of the}} day, but then to go no further. As the column halted for lunch, John Rose was sent north with a scouting party. Soon, two men returned to report that the scouts were skirmishing with a large force of Indians which was advancing towards the Americans.|$|E

5|$|MD 704 follows <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{right of}} way of the defunct WB Railway, an {{interurban}} railroad that included a northsouth line between Washington and Baltimore and a branch to Annapolis from Naval Academy Junction in Odenton. Construction on the electric railway began in 1902 and service began between the three cities in 1908. The WB went into receivership in 1931 and shut down in 1935. The Maryland State Roads Commission converted <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> railroad {{right of way}} into a two-lane highway from the District of Columbia line to US 50 (now MD 450) near Lanham between 1942 and 1944. The WB {{had a pair of}} timber bridges across its right of way. The Chapel Road bridge in Seat Pleasant, which carried what was then MD 389 and is now Addison Road across the railroad, was removed; the junction was regraded as an intersection with the new highway. In 1944, the War Production Board authorized the replacement of MD 202's bridge across <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> railroad {{as one of the few}} nonwar-effort highway projects federally funded during World War II. Construction on the new steel-and-concrete bridge began in late 1944 and was completed by 1946. Access between the grade-separated highways at the MD 202MD 704 junction was via a pair of two-way ramps.|$|E

The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after {{the decline of the}} manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E

5|$|A station {{here was}} part of <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> phase two {{expansion}} of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E
5|$|After the IND Sixth Avenue Line was {{completed}} in 1940, the city went into great debt, and only 33 new stations {{have been added to}} the system since, nineteen of which were part of defunct railways that already existed. Five stations were on <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which was incorporated into the system in 1941 as the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. Fourteen more stations were on <b>the</b> <b>abandoned</b> LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), which opened in 1955. Two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and opened in 1968; the Harlem–148th Street terminal opened that same year in an unrelated project. Six were built as part of a 1968 plan: three on the Archer Avenue Lines, opened in 1988, and three on the 63rd Street Lines, built in 1989. The new South Ferry station was built and connected to the existing Whitehall Street–South Ferry station in 2009. The one-stop 7 Subway Extension to the west side of Manhattan, comprising the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, was opened in 2015, and three stations on the Second Avenue Subway in the Upper East Side were opened in the beginning of 2017.|$|E
