500|$|Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's {{performance}} {{saying that}} it was [...] "amazing as usual– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in– <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." [...] Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to [...] "top" [...] the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle. Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a [...] "bizarro" [...] version of Jack Box, the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was [...] "more pop art than artistic pop music." [...] Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, [...] "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that she knows how to meld low art and high art at a party." [...] Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as [...] "sparse but impressive" [...] and wrote that Gaga appeared [...] "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the music video was {{generally}} favorable. Entertainment Weeklys columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close-ups of D'Angelo's physique a [...] "measure of the video's smarm-free joy {{that even though the}} camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating [...] "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating [...] "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's [...] "Thank U" [...] (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated [...] "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of The New York Times called it [...] "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that [...] "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".|$|E

She stated [...] "Chrono Cross is special. That it contains so many disparate and seemingly-random recruitable party members – though a few are key to the story – seems to be considered by gamers to be a weakness of the game, but narratively it's effective, enhancing the player's empathy for Serge's isolation. Each person {{has his or her}} own goals; the game contains no grand messages on love and friendship and unity. It isn't particularly directed, either, with rewards sometimes to be found for simply exploring areas on one's own. It's easy to forget one's objective, to feel lost. The result is the game feels like an essay on self-discovery, a process that is inherently lonely and often sad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scorsese {{wanted to}} depict the film's {{violence}} realistically, [...] "cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental".

With a budget of $25 million, Goodfellas was Scorsese's most expensive film to date but still only a medium budget by Hollywood standards. It {{was also the first}} time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film.

Scorsese argued that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of the scene. Scorsese and the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes. One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the one where Tommy tells the story and Henry is responding to him—the [...] "Do I amuse you?" [...] scene.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1978 Vysotsky {{took part}} in the {{underground}} censorship-defying literary project Metropolis, inspired and organized by Vasily Aksenov.

What followed though, was a return to the self-destructive theater and concert tours schedule, personal doctor Anatoly Fedotov now not only his companion, but part of Taganka's crew. [...] "Who was this Anatoly? Just a man who in every possible situation would try to provide drugs. And he did provide. In such moments Volodya trusted him totally," [...] Oksana Afanasyeva, Vysotsky's Moscow girlfriend (who was near him {{for most of the last}} year of his life and, on occasion, herself served as a drug courier) remembered. In July 1979, after a series of Central Asia concerts, Vysotsky collapsed, experienced clinical death and was resuscitated by Fedotov (who injected caffeine into the heart directly), colleague and close friend Vsevolod Abdulov helping with heart massage. In January 1980 Vysotsky asked Lyubimov for a year's leave. [...] "Up to you, but on condition that Hamlet is yours," [...] was the answer.

This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated.
