Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} period, the student {{publications}} appeared, such as The Cardinal (later replaced by The Razorback), {{as well as}} the Arkansas Traveler, the school's newspaper. Hill Hall, later demolished to make way for David W. Mullins Library, was constructed in 1901 as a boys' dormitory. Shortly thereafter, Buchanan retired to be replaced by Henry S. Hartzog, who was then followed by John N. Tillman. It was during Hartzog's tenure that Carnall Hall, a girls' dormitory, was built, and remains standing to this day. Tillman had been the selection of Governor Jeff Davis, and a blatantly political one at that. Such was the outrage of his predecessor, Hartzog, that the former president used his pulpit at the 1905 graduation, to rail against the decision as his last speech in an official capacity. Under Tillman, the tradition of Senior Walk was begun in 1905, the school officially changed its mascot from the cardinal to the razorback, as well was held the competition that selected the school's alma mater (won by Brodie Payne for a reward of $50). Tillman's presidency came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> stop in 1912 due to student protests over a scandal concerning school finances, which resulted in the expulsion of 36 students, that in turn led to general strike by the entire student body that lasted four days. The student dislike of their president, joined {{with the support of the}} citizens of Fayetteville, was enough to lead the board of trustees to request Tillman's resignation. Tillman's popularity suffered little, as two years later, he was elected to the first of five terms as a United States Congressman.|$|E

500|$|Noting the realism in {{the writing}} for the series, Gilchrist stated: [...] "It's as if Rhimes and Co. {{harnessed}} the sublime and the mundane of our daily experiences, that strange sense of drama that emerges from even the most unimportant daily conflicts, and it transported it on {{a world that is}} legitimately fraught with life and death decisions." [...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death. Gilchrist stated in response to Stevens' development in the last part of the second season: [...] "Izzie's descent into abject hysteria, which followed her season-long sanctimoniousness about everything, actually made me want something terrible to happen to her too." [...] He described how some episodes were not among the show's strongest, noting that the some plot lines created poignancy, and connected in an unfamiliar way.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated [...] "Director Peter Jackson, at {{home with}} all kinds of excess in New Zealand, keeps {{everything}} spinning nicely, not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners, but [...] "walked out the theater with mixed emotions," [...] she commented that [...] "Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow. These lively touches would leave The Frighteners looking more like a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson's film weren't so wearyingly overcrowded. The Frighteners is not immune to overkill, even though most of its characters are already dead." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also [...] "bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt", and that if [...] "Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures, the movie could have [...] "been the best of its kind". Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn't make Jackson's top five of movies, it [...] "is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time". The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson's native country, New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, many Japanese nationalists {{argued that}} the attack on Pearl Harbor was {{justified}} as they acted in self-defense {{in response to the}} oil embargo imposed by the United States. Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is [...] "ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid." [...] While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt by the American embargo, this [...] "need" [...] cannot be considered proportional with the destruction suffered by the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.|$|E

50|$|During the {{breeding}} season, mammals will {{call out to}} the opposite sex. Male koalas that are bigger will let out a different sound than smaller koalas. The bigger males which are routinely sought out for are called sires. Females choose sires because of indirect benefits that their offspring could inherit, like larger bodies. Non-sires and females do not vary in their body mass and can reject a male by screaming or hitting him. Male-male competition is rarely exhibited in koalas.Acoustic signaling {{is a type of}} call that can be used from a significant distance encoding an organism’s location, condition and identity. Sac-winged bats display acoustic signaling, which is often interpreted as songs. When females hear these songs, named a ‘whistle’, they call onto the males <b>to</b> breed with <b>a</b> <b>screech</b> of their own. This action is termed ‘calling of the sexes’. Red deer and spotted hyenas along with other mammals also perform acoustic signaling.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} screech tones on the {{broadband}} shock-associated noise of underexpanded jets is investigated experimentally. Screech is removed {{by means of}} a notched nozzle, and the properties of the broadband shock-associated noise in the screech-free configuration are compared <b>to</b> that in <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> flow. It is first demonstrated that the suppressing technique used is nonintrusive in that it does not alter the shock-cell structure of the jet plume. It is then shown that <b>screech</b> has <b>an</b> effect on the aerodynamics of the jet, which induces changes in the broadband shock-associated noise. Indeed, screech accelerates the damping of the shock-cell pattern, leading <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attenuation of the broadband shock-associated noise and a shifting of this noise component to higher frequencies. Moreover, a tuning between the peak frequency of the broadband shock-associated noise and the screech frequency is observed. It is also deduced from the directivity of the broadband shock-associated noise in the far field that the convective velocity in the shear layer is modified in the presence of screech tones. I...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>screeching</b> halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 yrs or [...] on U.S.A. models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended. Transmissions replaced prior to March 2005 usually fail again. [...] Transmissions replaced from March 2005 and later include a redesigned third gear clutch pack reported to fix the problem.|$|E
