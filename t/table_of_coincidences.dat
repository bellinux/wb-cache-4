40|$|This article {{introduces}} Coincidence Algorithm (COIN). It is an algorithm in {{the class}} of Evolutionary Algorithm, specialised to solve combinatorial problems. COIN belongs to a subgroup of Evolutionary Algorithms which makes use of models to generate solutions instead of searching traditional population. The model of COIN is a joint probability <b>table</b> <b>of</b> adjacent events (<b>coincidence)</b> derived from the population of candidate solutions. As COIN is especially good at Combinatorial Optimisation, it has been applied successfully to many industrial engineering problems. A full account of COIN and its comparison to contemporary algorithms are presented. The application of COIN to real world problems are illustrated to show examples how COIN can be used.

40|$|Believers tend to {{view the}} {{experience}} <b>of</b> <b>coincidences</b> as evidence {{for a variety of}} paranormal beliefs in mind and mysterious causal mechanisms out in the world. On the other hand, skeptics (e. g. most psychologists) tend to dismiss the psychological experience <b>of</b> <b>coincidences</b> as just yet one more demonstration of how irrational people can be. Irrationality in this context means an association between the experience <b>of</b> <b>coincidences</b> and biased cognition in terms of poor probabilistic reasoning and a propensity for paranormal beliefs. In this article, we present a third way: the rationalist perspective on the psychology <b>of</b> <b>coincidence</b> occurrence. We develop this new emphasis, including a new definition <b>of</b> <b>coincidence,</b> out <b>of</b> reviewing and synthesizing the extant literature on coincidences. We then propose a new three stage model to describe the psychological experience <b>of</b> <b>coincidence,</b> the 3 C's model: 1. (C) o-incidence detection, 2. (C) ausal mechanism search 3. (C) oincidence versus cause judgment. The core principles in this model are that people use the same properties relevant for causal reasoning when detecting and evaluating events that are ultimately judged to be coincidental, and we describe how the model can account for the key prior research on coincidences. Crucially, rather than just being examples of irrationality, we argue that the experience <b>of</b> <b>coincidences</b> is a necessary consequence of rational causal learning mechanisms and provides a widely ignored approach to evaluating the mechanisms of causal reasoning...|$|R
