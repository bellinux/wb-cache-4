6000|$|Mr. Hooker {{fixed his}} eyes on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> <b>rose,</b> and pretended to look out of the window; then, taking his seat again by the table, as if {{fronting}} an imaginary audience, and pulling slowly at his gauntlets after the usual theatrical indication of perfect sangfroid, said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took him}} along {{a passage in}} the basement, {{up a flight of}} steps, and into a huge, solitary, chill apartment. It was the ball-room. Spacious mirrors in gilt frames formed panels in {{the lower part of the}} walls, the {{remainder}} being toned in sage-green. In a recess between each mirror was a statue. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> in a segmental curve, and bore sprawling upon its face gilt figures of wanton goddesses, cupids, satyrs with tambourines, drums, and trumpets, the whole ceiling seeming alive with them. But the room was very gloomy now, there being little light admitted from without, and the reflections from the mirrors gave a depressing coldness to the scene. It was a place intended to look joyous by night, and whatever it chose to look by day.|$|E
5000|$|The theatre is {{recorded}} in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 6 July 1976. [...] It is constructed in Accrington-type brick with a slate roof. It is three storeys high and has a gabled façade, divided into five unequal bays. To its left is a two-storey, four-bay building incorporating the entrance and containing offices. Inside the theatre is an auditorium with a dress circle, gallery and boxes. The front of these is decorated with plasterwork, including cartouches and reclining figures. There is more plasterwork decoration on the proscenium arch and <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> timber <b>ceiling</b> is in a concave {{form and}} {{is made up}} of three rows of six {{rectangular}} panels. All eighteen panels are rather simply ornamented, with a simple rectangular border and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> at their centres. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> in <b>the</b> centre row are larger and more elaborate than those in the side rows. From the centre of each circle hangs a lamp. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> edge ends in deeply mouled plaster cornice that runs {{along the length of the}} cathedral. As the height of the east end has been raised at different times, the dimensions of the entablature no longer relate to the columns properly, as their bases have been raised. The Cathedral was once lit with victorian crystal chandeliers, but these have since been replaced with the simpler lamps one sees today.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{fittings}} {{which are}} early and rare include <b>the</b> lower floor <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses,</b> <b>the</b> lower floor <b>ceiling</b> with associated cornice, the painted glass transom windows and timber joinery.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the rooms}} of the {{original}} house have 13 ft 6in high ceilings, picture rails, timber fretwork <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> and timber partitioning in 5in wide tongue-and-groove boards. The main drawing room has a large bay window framed by an arch. The windows are large double-hung timber sashes with two panes per sash. While the side windows have long been removed and replaced by French windows and fanlights, evidence of their existence remains behind the door-jambs on the verandah, above the fan light and from the part removal of diagonal bracing. Original timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> have been uncovered throughout the house and replicas have replaced those that were missing. Electric fans have been installed {{in some of the}} rooms and wired up through <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses.</b> Above <b>the</b> internal doors are decorative timber fretwork panels. The pattern is very similar to the fretwork in Osler House and similar to fretwork attributed to Benjamin Toll that is found also in Charters Towers. Floors throughout are 6in wide hoop pine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{layout of}} the new church ignored {{conventional}} orientation, having the altar on the north-west side directly opposite the entrance. The nave was circular in plan, about 54 feet across, with a circular niche for the altar and a porch and vestry on the opposite side. A wooden gallery ran all around the church, except above the altar, supported by brackets concealed in the flooring. The coved ceiling was ornamented with panels, each decorated with a flower. The centre of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> into a large lantern with glass sides. There were no side windows. The interior was described in Britton's Illustrations of the Public Buildings of London as having [...] "more {{the air of a}} lecture room than a church".|$|E
6000|$|Now all {{stared at}} Bes who {{continued}} to stare at <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and I <b>rose</b> to say something, I know not what, when suddenly the doors opened and through them appeared heralds, crying, ...|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} three bedrooms and one bathroom. Two of the bedrooms {{have access to}} the front verandah via the French doors. The internal doorways have rectangular fanlights with decorative timber fretwork. <b>The</b> walls and <b>ceilings</b> are of timber VJs and all of <b>the</b> rooms have <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses.</b> <b>The</b> interior and exterior of the building and out-buildings is remarkably intact.|$|R
50|$|The former {{pavilion}} is a large, open {{room with}} high ceilings. It is accessed via stairs {{from the one}} of the tenancies on the ground level. Walls have a smooth rendered finish to the north and part of the walls to the west. Other walls are lined in v-jointed boards. The lower sections of the internal walls are lined with plywood and timber battened sheeting. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> is lined with decorative pressed metal sheeting with large pressed metal cornices finished with leaf-shaped cornice mitres in the internal corners. Two decorative circular pressed metal ceiling vents are located on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Metal <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> (former pendant fittings have been removed) are also located on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Wall and window trims are clear finished timber. Floors are timber tongue and groove boards. A door formerly accessing a dumbwaiter is located in a small alcove on the southern side of the room. A concrete wash tub is located in the north-west corner of the room.|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{the door}} {{there were two}} branches, at right angles. Dick chose one of them at random, and the pair hurried, with echoing footsteps, along the hollow of the chapel roof. The top of <b>the</b> arched <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> like a whale's back in the dim glimmer of the lamp. Here and there were spy-holes, concealed, on the other side, by the carving of the cornice; and looking down through one of these, Dick saw the paved floor of the chapel--the altar, with its burning tapers--and, {{stretched}} before it on the steps, the figure of Sir Oliver praying with uplifted hands.|$|R
60|$|He prodded it again-regarding {{it closely}} this time. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> at once <b>rose</b> to greater altitudes, {{and at the}} same moment an old face with bushy {{whiskers}} crawled under the edge of it, and asked him profanely what he meant by it. It also asked him whether he wanted something for himself, because, if so, he was going the right way to work.|$|R
50|$|By 1864, rapid {{population}} growth in the area saw {{the need for a}} larger church and in 1868 work began on a second church. This church served the community's needs until 1885 when construction began on the present church. This church, designed by John Geiser was built in Gothic Revival Style architecture. The new church was an imposing structure on the landscape, constructed of Chaska Brick with a steeple towering 162 feet above the street. <b>The</b> interior <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> 39 feet above the floor. It was described {{as one of the most}} adorned structures in the area. The new building was dedicated by Bishop Thomas Langdon Grace, O.P. of St. Paul in 1885.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} fittings are elaborate and ornamental, {{typical of a}} Jacobean house. The crafting of <b>the</b> interior <b>ceilings,</b> plasters, mouldings and balustrades is the handiwork of Christchurch artisans. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> depicts <b>roses</b> with mouldings of simple design at the wall corners. The two rooms {{on the ground floor}} near the entrance have elaborate coffered ceilings with a well-carved, gilded, central decorative. The top part of the doors in each of the main rooms has a well-ornamented wooden typanium. The balustrades of the staircase and the newel post have been featured with thistles and flowers, an emblem of Scotland (a reminder of the owner's homeland). The newel posts in particular have carvings of acanthus leaves and beading; brass lights which decorate the posts are also fitted over them.|$|R
50|$|The park's caves, {{limestone}} formations {{and rugged}} bluffs represent {{a step back}} in geological time of thousands of years. Stalactites once hung from <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and stalagmites <b>rose</b> from the floor. Souvenir hunters have robbed the caves of this rare beauty, but many formations remain. The park's limestone caves, arches and chimneys including Dancehall Cave, Hernado's Hideaway, Shinbone Cave, Wye Cave, and an unmarked cave within the Dancehall Cavern locally known as Steelgate Cave.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{is divided}} into six bays by curved and moulded timber brackets, joined by tie rods across the room. A pressed metal <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> is centred within each bay. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> also is lined with beaded boards, running diagonally where <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> rakes up to the collar tie.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the hotel has been recently renovated in a style that replicates details from {{the period in which}} the building was constructed. Surviving original interior elements on the ground floor level include <b>the</b> cornices, <b>ceilings</b> and <b>roses,</b> <b>the</b> cedar fireplace mantle and staircase and the walls to the stairhall. The upper floor is in a comparatively intact condition and contains much of its original layout and joinery. The rear verandah has been enclosed and the rear stair survives.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom and Australia, a <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> is a {{decorative}} element affixed to <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{from which a}} chandelier or light fitting is often suspended. They are typically round in shape and display a variety of ornamental designs.|$|R
50|$|The private bar is {{a narrow}} {{room with the}} bar along the western wall. Apart from <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which has two <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> and {{decorative}} cornices, the fit-out, furniture and finishes of this bar are recent and not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{of the church is}} a simple open space with decorative embellishment. A platform is located across the northern end of the church from which a pair of doors lead into the hall. A pointed arch in the southern end provides access to the entrance porch. The walls are rendered and <b>the</b> coffered <b>ceiling</b> is lined with beaded boards. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> houses 5 fretwork <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> positioned between <b>the</b> tie rods which brace the building.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} the ground floor, one encounters the former banking chamber, now a large reception foyer for the Cattleman's Union. This room has a particularly ornate pressed metal ceiling {{divided into three}} sections with heavy beams clad with pressed metal. Each section is decorated with moulded ribs dividing the surface of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> into smaller planes decorated with panels of foliated moulding and <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{internal}} {{wall lining}} to the Reading Room and Library is vertical {{tongue and groove}} boarding, apart from the eastern wall of the Library {{where it has been}} removed. The walls to the Reading Room have a timber picture rail. The Kitchen walls are lined with fibrous cement sheet. All of <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> are also tongue and groove boards, with two pressed zinc <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> to <b>the</b> Reading Room, and one each to the Library and Kitchen.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the Action Realty offices is of modern open plan design with partitions providing individual work spaces and a reception counter at <b>the</b> front. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> ground floor has been lowered from its original height. The upper floor has been opened to create a large space over {{the area of the}} two shops. It still contains an original staircase in the eastern end of the building. <b>The</b> ground floor <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> printers' shop still displays original <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> and cornices picked out in pink paint.|$|R
50|$|Timber {{stairs with}} carved newels {{located at the}} end of the {{corridor}} give access both to upstairs rooms and a sheeted storage area at half-landing level via coloured glass doors. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> throughout <b>the</b> upper level are half-raked and follow the lines of the roofs. The floor level steps up toward the south, accommodating higher <b>ceilings</b> below. <b>The</b> principal rooms have dormer windows expressed in <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> French doors glazed in geometric patterns opening onto small balconies, and circular timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses.</b> A small room {{at the end of}} the corridor contains narrow timber stairs leading to a platform at the top of the tower.

2500|$|In May 2014, {{one of the}} [...] "gilded-plaster rosettes" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Main Reading Room fell to {{the floor}} 50 feet below. The NYPL closed the Rose Main Reading Room and the Bill Blass Public Catalog Room for renovations. The $12 million {{restoration}} project included “recreating and replacing the rosette that fell, reinforcing each rosette with steel cables, and installing LED lighting.” The NYPL commissioned EverGreene Architectural Arts to recreate the mural in the Bill Blass Public Catalog Room, which had “suffered irreparable discoloration, overpainting and water damage” during its 105-year history. The NYPL also installed a $2.6 million book delivery system, using a conveyor belt and 24 book carts that could each carry up to [...] through the library's eleven levels. The restored Rose Main Reading Room and Bill Blass Public Catalog Room reopened October 5, 2016.|$|R
