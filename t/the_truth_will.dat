5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, Monarch {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, Monarch was conducting gunnery practice south-east of Fair Isle when she was unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine-fired torpedo. This was probably a false alarm as the area was too far to the west of the German U-boats' patrol zones to be likely. , however, has been suggested as a candidate for the attack, although the boat was sunk the following day with the loss of all hands and <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> never be known.|$|E

25|$|A {{second round}} of secret {{diplomacy}} by Anderson in February 1956 was equally unsuccessful. Nasser sometimes suggested during his talks with Anderson that {{he was interested in}} peace with Israel if only the Americans would supply him with unlimited quantities of military and economic aid. In case of Israeli acceptance to the return of the Palestinian refugees to Israel and to Egypt annexing the southern half of Israel, Egypt would not accept a peace settlement. The United States or the United Nations would have to present the Israeli acceptance to all Arabs as a basis for peace settlements. It is not clear if Nasser was sincerely interested in peace, or just merely saying what the Americans wanted to hear in the hope of obtaining American funding for the Aswan high dam and American weapons. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> likely never be known as Nasser was an intensely secretive man, who managed to hide his true opinions on most issues from both contemporaries and historians. However, the British historian P. J. Vatikitos noted that Nasser's determination to promote Egypt as the world's foremost anti-Zionist state as a way of reinforcing his claim to Arab leadership meant that peace was unlikely.|$|E
500|$|Grace Dent of The Guardian {{commented on}} the realism of Zoe's storyline {{involving}} Adrian stating: [...] "hapless Zoe failed her exams after refusing to shag dismal tutor Adrian. Predatory lecturers taking advantage of gullible women? Actually, that's a plot line I can get my head around.

[...] Lesbian culture website AfterEllen.com opined [...] "she doesn't seem like the type of woman to give up without a fight" [...] where Sarah and Mike are concerned. They also branded her storyline [...] "scandalous" [...] and said [...] "It appears that in the UK, some television writers actually {{pay attention to what}} their actors want." [...] This was in response to Lister suggesting the storyline.|$|E
500|$|The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave Protestants {{legal status}} and a {{congregation}} was formed under the pastorship of Paul-Henri Marron, {{who had been}} serving as the chaplain at the Dutch embassy. [...] The congregation gained permission to worship openly in 1789 during the revolution and met {{in a variety of}} places including a wine shop before gaining permission to rent Saint-Louis-du-Louve, the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris. [...] For the dedication of the new church, or temple as French Protestants referred to their buildings, Pastor Marron preached from the text, [...] "Soyez joyeux dans l’espérance, patients dans l’affliction, persévérants dans la prière," [...] (be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12)). [...] When the mayor, Jean Bailly, attended in person on 13 October 1791 Marron chose the passage, [...] "Vous connaissez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres," [...] (you will know the truth, and <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> set you free (John 8:32)).|$|E

500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} criticized for {{appearing}} to fabricate portions of its storyline. One source of speculation arose during the fifth season, when Kenya Moore allegedly requested that Walter Jackson pretend to be her boyfriend; series producers were reportedly unaware of said arrangement. Moore commented that such claims were [...] "completely false", and further [...] " [...] viewers to stay tuned because <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> come to light." [...] Moore was also criticized for alleging that she was financially stable, although she reportedly joined the series as a source of income to offset the difficulties with her lawsuits from several creditors. In May 2013, Porsha Williams allegedly staged her divorce from Kordell Stewart to secure her position on the series, which she reportedly feared was in jeopardy. In December 2013, Williams received additional criticism for comments made in an episode aired during the sixth season, where she indicated that she believed the Underground Railroad was an actual railroad line.|$|E
500|$|Marsden first {{appeared}} on 5 March 2001 in the [...] "Who Shot Phil?" [...] storyline. In the whodunit storyline the five main suspects were Dan Sullivan, Steve Owen, Lisa Shaw, Ian Beale and Mark Fowler. A source in the Daily Record said, [...] "Sooner or later <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> out. But until then there's {{going to be a}} lot of probing going on." [...] She left on 27 March 2001 after unsuccessfully identifying the shooter (who turned out to be Lisa). In 2002 she appeared in January, April and from 14 November to 6 December. In November, when Marsden returns, the police suspect that Phil has murdered his ex-wife Lisa. The Daily Mirror said, [...] "They are the words Phil Mitchell has heard many times before.

2500|$|Another {{issue in}} the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial.

It is unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for {{the first part of the}} project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.|$|E
2500|$|Erich Fromm {{finds that}} trying to discuss truth as [...] "absolute truth" [...] is sterile and that {{emphasis}} ought {{to be placed on}} [...] "optimal truth". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in [...] "a strange and powerful world". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality.

2500|$|In late 2005, Wales edited his own biographical {{entry on}} the English Wikipedia.

But this is a futile process because in our {{brave new world of}} transparent activity and maximum communication, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> out." [...] Wales was also observed to have modified references to Bomis {{in a way that was}} characterized as downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company's products.

2500|$|Hare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 {{members and}} over 100 centers in Russia, {{expressed}} {{fear that the}} trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, {{will be followed by}} a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide. The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension. On November 1, ISKCON leader in India Gopal Krishna Goswami appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow. [...] Hindu followers in Russia from India, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Nepal and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the Hindu Council of Russia meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected Sadhu Priya Das, and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman. [...] Das said that [...] they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia, and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that [...] "finally <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> prevail".|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} {{religious}} freedom, Luciani {{wrote about the}} council's declaration, [...] "Dignitatis humanae". In his writings, {{he said that there}} is only one true religion that must be followed and no other, affirming that Jesus Christ is the Truth, and that <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>will</b> set one truly free. Though, he said that those that will not accept the one true Catholic Faith, for whatever reason, are indeed free to profess their own religion for various reasons. He makes a clear understanding of true and false liberty. He says that true freedom comes from God, that God makes man free. However, he does continue in repeating the teaching that error does not come from God, and although we are capable or err and sin, and that one who rejects truth cannot be forced to believe it, it is not a God given right to do error. He continues to say that religious freedom must be freely exercised by the individual. He writes that the choice of religion must be a free choice or else one's faith is not real or because they really believe. So he makes clear that for the purposes of keeping peace and order in a diverse society and accepting the free will of man, the freedom of an individual to profess their religion, within certain bounds, is indeed necessary.|$|E
