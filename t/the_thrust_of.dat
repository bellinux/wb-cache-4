5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E
5|$|Helped by his schoolfriend Cammarotta-AdornoIn, Coandă {{started to}} build his slender {{sesquiplane}} and the unusual powerplant in a workshop {{in the courtyard of}} his house where he tested <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the powerplant on a dynamometer, tests which are described in detail in the April 1910 edition of La Technique Aéronautique. He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later additions to the existing patents.|$|E
5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg was {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained {{popular with the}} general public. The book has also been {{used as the basis}} for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who! These two books later provided <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone that}} was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels {{more or less}} shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E

50|$|The above {{equation}} {{applies only}} for air-breathing jet engines. It {{does not apply}} to rocket engines. Most types of jet engine have an air intake, which provides the bulk of the fluid exiting the exhaust. Conventional rocket engines, however, do not have an intake, the oxidizer and fuel both being carried within the vehicle. Therefore, rocket engines do not have ram drag and <b>the</b> gross <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket engine nozzle is <b>the</b> net <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> characteristics <b>of</b> a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine, and <b>thrust</b> is independent <b>of</b> velocity.|$|R

5|$|Together with Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens, the Goat Rocks volcano {{is part of}} a {{triangle}} of volcanoes, an arrangement not found elsewhere in the Cascades. This may be related to a mid-crust zone with abnormally high electrical conductivity, the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC), which is not well understood by geologists. Scientists from the United States Geodynamics Committee hypothesized in 1994 that this anomaly is associated with <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> a large deposit of sedimentary rock against a continental margin. However, Hill et al. (2009) dismiss this view as it proves inconsistent with maps made from magnetotelluric readings of the area. Instead, they propose that the anomaly is linked to the region's volcanism, which has caused partial melting of the crust.|$|E
5|$|According to Piers Jackson, <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> {{the design}} was {{to produce a}} title that could {{showcase}} the full abilities of the PlayStation Portable, including its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Jackson also asserted that Resurrection was an entirely different game from the original; whilst the studio had taken the basic story {{and some of the}} locations from the original game, all the code, graphics and voice actors were changed. New additions to Resurrection included an expanded plot, added mini-games, multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function. During late stages of development, the studio attempted to preserve ideas that they thought worked well in the original, though their uses were altered or repositioned to keep the game fresh even to those who had played the original. The addition of the 'Anubis Stone' sub-plot was to strengthen the story arc and the creation of Al-Zalam was to act as Dan's internal monologue as well as the player's guide.|$|E
5|$|Several Land Reform Acts were enacted {{to provide}} {{ownership}} rights to poor farmers. Up to September 2001, more than 20,000,000 acres (80,000km²) of land had been distributed to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the landless poor. <b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> banking policy in India {{has been to}} improve banking facilities in the rural areas. The Minimum Wages Act of 1948 empowers government to fix minimum wages for employees engaged in various employments. The Consumer Protection Act of 1986 provides for the better protection of consumers. The act is intended to provide simple, speedy and inexpensive redressal to the consumers' grievances, award relief and compensation wherever appropriate to the consumer. The Equal Remuneration Act of 1976, provides for equal pay for equal work {{for both men and}} women. The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana was launched in 2001 to attain the objective of gainful employment for the rural poor. The programme was implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> Stern's {{defense is}} that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E

25|$|The Glenmore Dam is a {{gravity dam}} which uses the {{downward}} force (weight) {{of the structure}} to resist the horizontal pressure of the water within the dam. These massive dams resist <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> water entirely by their own weight.|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature of}} Amery's outlook was a {{significant}} distrust of the administration of US President Franklin Roosevelt because of <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the United States Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, to use all of his influence to pressure Canada to oppose imperial free trade, perhaps Amery's most important project. While the pressure was unsuccessful as long as Canadian Conservative Prime Minister Richard Bedford Bennett was in power, after he lost the 1935 election, his Liberal successor, William Lyon Mackenzie King, adopted a more pro-American stance.|$|E
25|$|In later-period {{additions}} to the Mosque of Córdoba, the basic architectural design was changed: Horseshoe arches were now used for the upper row of arcades, which is now supported by five-pass arches. In sections which now supported domes, additional supporting structures were needed to bear <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the cupolas. The architects solved this problem by the construction of intersecting three- or five-pass arches. The three domes spanning the vaults above the mihrab wall are constructed as ribbed vaults. Rather than meeting {{in the center of}} the dome, the ribs intersect one another off-center, forming an eight-pointed star in the center which is superseded by a pendentive dome.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} Il-22 {{was rapidly}} assembled and {{made its first}} flight on 24 July 1947. It proved to have docile handling characteristics, but was severely underpowered as the TR-1 engines produced only 80% of the required thrust. During {{the latter part of}} the manufacturer's flight tests the Il-22 made the first-ever Soviet jet-assisted takeoff on 7 February 1948 with a pair of SR-2 boosters. As <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the engines could not be increased in a timely manner Ilyushin made the decision not to submit the bomber for state acceptance trials as its performance did not meet the requirements laid down for it in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The Warrant Design showed {{external}} buttresses on {{the ground}} floor level.These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestorey and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper storey which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the buttresses on the lower walls.|$|E
25|$|Afterburning Olympus: As {{early as}} 1952, Bristol had {{considered}} {{the use of}} reheat, or afterburning, to augment <b>the</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the Olympus. Initially, a system called Bristol Simplifed Reheat was devised which was tested on a Rolls-Royce Derwent V mounted in an Avro Lincoln. Later it was tested on an Orenda engine in Canada and on an Olympus Mk 100 in the Avro Ashton test bed. Fully variable reheat became possible after {{an agreement with the}} Solar Aircraft Company of San Diego which manufactured bench units for the Olympus Mks 101 and 102. An afterburning Olympus was just one proposal for the Vulcan Phase 6, a 350,000 lb aircraft with a 13/14 hour endurance.|$|E
