25|$|VOC’s dire {{situation}} {{after the}} Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did {{not escape the}} king’s attention, but– like Amangkurat II– he avoided any open breach with VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma to do all <b>the</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>work,</b> such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC’s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August {{and they were all}} wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.|$|E

In the 1970s and 1980s, heavy manufacturing jobs went to other countries by the tens of thousands. The result was cheaper goods for U.S. consumers and less pollution in many of the nation's industrial cities.

2500|$|In La Fontaine's telling, Bertrand {{the monkey}} persuades Raton the cat to pull {{chestnuts}} from the embers amongst {{which they are}} roasting, promising him a share. As the cat scoops them from the fire one by one, burning his paw in the process, the monkey gobbles them up. They are disturbed by a maid entering and the cat gets nothing for its pains. It is from this fable that the French get their idiom , meaning to act as someone's dupe or, deriving from that, to benefit from <b>the</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>work</b> of others. It is also {{the source of the}} English idiom 'a cat's paw', defined in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as 'one used by another as a tool'. There are earlier idiomatic allusions in 15th century Burgundian sources. Jean Miélot records the saying c'est un bon jeu de chat et singe (it's a cat and monkey game) in his Proverbes (1456) and there is another apparent reference to the story in a poem in Jean Molinet's [...] Faictz et dictz. In the following century, Jean-Antoine de Baïf has the version faire comme le singe, tirer les marrons du feu avec la patte du chat in his Mimes, enseignements et proverbes (1575) [...] and John Florio includes the saying in his collection of idioms Second Frutes (1591).|$|E
2500|$|With four contestants remaining, Brkich won {{her first}} {{individual}} Immunity challenge, {{and she and}} Mariano convinced Lewis to vote out Boneham, reminding him that they would draw rocks otherwise, with a two-out-of-three chance that either she or her main ally Boneham would be eliminated anyway, and {{that none of the}} other three could beat Boneham in a jury vote should he reach Final Tribal Council. Mariano won the next and final immunity and chose Brkich to continue with him to the Final Two. Facing the jury, the couple met criticism for their aggressive and underhanded gameplay. [...] Mariano took the brunt of the criticism, as he was seen as the leader of their dominant two-person alliance, and was deemed by the jury as the one with more blood on his hands. Meanwhile, Brkich admitted to being there partly by riding Mariano's coattails and letting him do more of <b>the</b> <b>dirty</b> <b>work</b> while she worked behind the scenes, but argued that her impressive overall social and underrated quiet strategic game was a key part of both getting to the finals together. [...] She also seemed to get less blame by the jury for decisions she and Mariano largely made together, and thus wisely stayed somewhat in the background during the Final Tribal Council.|$|E
