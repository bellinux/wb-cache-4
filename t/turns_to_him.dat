2500|$|Douglas’s Monodramas are ten 30- to 60-second videos from 1991, {{conceived}} as interventions into commercial television, broadcast nightly in British Columbia {{for three weeks}} in 1992. These short narratives, set in bleak suburban locations, mimic television’s editing techniques, with plots dealing often mundane situations and with a slight twist at the end. The segment [...] "I'm Not Gary" [...] {{is set in a}} nondescript industrial strip. A white man passes a second man who is black, calling out to him [...] "Gary?" [...] and is visibly irritated at not being acknowledged. Finally, the second man <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> replying, [...] "I'm not Gary." [...] For writer Lisa Coulthard, race is the interpretive framework, because for the white man in the video, [...] "his interlocutor is simply a black man, interchangeable with any other for example and clearly interchangeable with Gary." ...|$|E

[...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and puts out her hand, making him shrink back.

2500|$|Nimue takes Merlin to her burnt village, Oxleigh, {{where they}} learn that Vortigan has been after the Holy Grail. They trek to the Flame of Prometheus, where Merlin uses {{a portion of the}} flame to reforge the Grail into Excalibur. Vortigan {{followed}} them in his quest for the Grail, and when he sees Excalibur, he attacks Nimue, apparently killing her, before taking Excalibur for himself. Merlin believes Nimue to be dead, and is racked by grief as Vortigan <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Unexpectedly, at this point, a healthy Nimue rips out Vortigan's heart and reveals that she had drunk from the Holy Grail, desiring power and immortality like Merlin's, and thirsty for vengeance against Vortigan. Despite Merlin's pleas and warning, Nimue crushes Vortigan's heart, killing him. This allows the darkness from within Vortigan's heart to infect her, transforming Nimue into the very first [...] "Dark One". The Promethean Flame is extinguished to an ember, and Nimue goes on to shatter Excalibur into two pieces, in order to prevent Merlin from ending the immortality of both of them. Then, Nimue apologizes to him for her actions, but Merlin says no, that {{he is the one who}} is sorry.|$|E
