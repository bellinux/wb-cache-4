5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>Virus</b> may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus,</b> which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E

50|$|A lethal ovitrap is {{a device}} which attracts gravid female container-breeding {{mosquitoes}} and kills them. The traps halt the insect's life cycle by killing adult insects and stopping reproduction. The original use of ovitraps was {{to monitor the}} spread and density of Aedes and other container-breeding mosquito populations by collecting eggs which could be counted, or hatched to identify the types of insects. Since its conception, researchers found that adding lethal substances to the ovitraps could control the populations of these targeted species. These traps are called lethal ovitraps. They primarily target Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are the main vectors of dengue fever, Zika <b>virus,</b> <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus,</b> yellow fever, and chikungunya.|$|R

25|$|Corvids are {{reservoirs}} (carriers) for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> in the United States. They {{are infected}} by mosquitoes (the vectors), primarily of the Culex species. Crows and ravens are quickly killed by this disease, so their deaths are an early-warning system when West Nile virus arrives {{in an area}} (as are horse and other bird species deaths). One of the first signs that West Nile virus first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.|$|E
40|$|The {{mosquito}} Culex quinquefasciatus is a ubiquitous {{species that}} serves as a major vector for <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> <b>virus</b> and lymphatic filariasis. Ingestion of bloodmeal by females triggers a series of physiological processes in the midgut and also exposes them to infection by these pathogens. The bacteria normally harbored in the midgut are known to influence physiology and can also alter the response to various pathogens. The midgut bacteria in female Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes collected over a large geographical area from India was studied. Examination of 16 S ribosomal DNA amplicons from culturable microflora revealed the presence of 83 bacterial species belonging to 31 bacterial genera. All of these species belong to three phyla i. e. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Phylum Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum (37 species), followed by Firmicutes (33 species) and Actinobacteria (13 species). Phylum Proteobacteria, was dominated by members of γ-proteobacteria class. The genus Staphylococcus was the largest genus represented by 11 species whereas Enterobacter was the most prevalent genus and recovered from all the field stations except Leh. Highest bacterial prevalence was observed from Bhuj (22 species) followed by Nagrota (18 species), Masimpur (18 species) and Hathigarh (16 species). Whereas, least species were observed from Leh (8 species). It has been observed that individual mosquito harbor extremely diverse gut bacteria and have very small overlap bacterial taxa in their gut. This variation in midgut microbiota {{may be one of the}} factors responsible for variation in disease transmission rates or vector competence within mosquito population. The present data strongly encourage further investigations to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria in mosquito for the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> <b>virus.</b> To <b>the</b> best of our knowledge this is the first study on midgut microbiota of wild Cx. quinquefasciatus from over a large geographical area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Several {{populations of}} Culex pipiens sensu latu mosquitoes, a vector of mosquito-born flaviviruses such as <b>west</b> <b>nile</b> <b>virus,</b> have {{developed}} resistance to pyrethroids in the United States. To design and then institute resistance monitoring, mitigation, and management strategies, {{knowledge of the}} mechanisms of resistance will be required. Preliminary investigations conducted on Culex pipiens s. l. populations in California and Southern Africa strongly suggest that this resistance is mediated by enzymatic detoxification and/or target-site sensitivity. The aims are to determine permethrin resistance levels in first generation progeny of colonies-collected Culex spp. from various regions of California and evaluate the levels of detoxification enzyme [esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) ] and improve diagnostic Knockdown resistance (kdr) in F 1 progeny of Culex spp. mosquitoes with confirmed permethrin resistance. In this study, mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex were collected at various sites throughout California and tested for esterase, GST, and kdr activities. The esterase, GST, and kdr activities were compared to the corresponding activities found in a pyrethroid-sensitive laboratory strain Culex quinquefasciatus (CQ 1). A correlation was found between elevated esterases activities and kdr assay indicating that further investigation {{should be done to}} figure out the potential role of enzyme detoxification and kdr assay in conceding resistance to pyrethroids class.

25|$|JEV is a {{virus from}} the family Flaviviridae, part of the Japanese {{encephalitis}} serocomplex of 9 genetically and antigenically related viruses, some which are particularly severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The enveloped virus {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> and the St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single-stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus into the inside of the cell. The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, N4a, NS4b, NS5). NS1 is produced as secretory form also. NS3 is a putative helicase, and NS5 is the viral polymerase. It has been noted that Japanese encephalitis infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins for the Japanese Encephalitis.|$|E

40|$|RANTES (CCL 5) is a {{chemokine}} {{expressed by}} many hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types that {{plays an important}} role in homing and migration of effector and memory T cells during acute infections. The RANTES receptor, CCR 5, is a major target of anti-HIV drugs based on blocking viral entry. However, defects in RANTES or RANTES receptors including CCR 5 can compromise immunity to acute infections in animal models and lead to more severe disease in humans infected with <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> (WNV). In contrast, the role of the RANTES pathway in regulating T cell responses and immunity during chronic infection remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for RANTES in the control of systemic chronic LCMV infection. In RANTES 2 / 2 mice, virus-specific CD 8 T cells had poor cytokine production. These RANTES 2 / 2 CD 8 T cells also expressed higher amounts of inhibitory receptors consistent with more severe exhaustion. Moreover, the cytotoxic ability of CD 8 T cells from RANTES 2 / 2 mice was reduced. Consequently, viral load was higher in the absence of RANTES. The dysfunction of T cells in the absence of RANTES was as severe as CD 8 T cell responses generated in the absence of CD 4 T cell help. Our results demonstrate an important role for RANTES in sustaining CD 8 T cell responses during a systemic chroni...|$|R

The sera were titrated fresh or after lipoprotein deterioration brought about by ageing the samples at 4 degrees C for various periods of time and by freezing at - 20 degrees C with subsequent thawing. Deterioration was seen as altered electrophoretic mobility while the lipoproteins in treated sera were detected by indicator arboviruses whose haemagglutination {{is known to be}} strongly inhibited by the native macromolecules. After both treatments, notably manganous chloride/heparin, residual NSI activity was detected in deteriorated samples, particularly with group B arboviruses such as Japanese encephalitis and <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>viruses</b> but generally less so or not at all with the group A arboviruses employed. Absolutely fresh sera are considered highly desirable for rubella virus HAI assay, and it is suggested that the efficiency of lipoprotein NSI removal regardless of treatment protocol could be monitored in parallel HAI tests using carefully chosen indicator arboviruses. This could be done in conjunction with density gradient centrifugation of doubtful sera should ultracentrifuging facilities be available. The suitability of the monitoring procedure would be dependent to some extent on whether certain arboviruses are known to be endemic in a particular area...|$|R

40|$|<b>WEST</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> (WNV) is an {{arbovirus}} of {{the genus}} Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), which is transmitted and amplified in enzootic cycles between avian hosts and many species of mosquito vectors (Higgs and others 2004). At least 59 mos-quito species {{have been identified as}} vectors for WNV, mainly from the genus Culex, including the common house mos-quito Culex pipiens (Hayes and others 2005). Clinical disease has been described in reptiles, birds and mammals, including human beings, and can range from fever to encephalitis to death (Zeller and Schuffenecker 2004). The virus was first iso-lated from a pyrexic woman in Uganda in 1937 (Smithburn and others 1940) and sporadic outbreaks and human cases have been described in Europe and the Middle East since the 1960 s (Murgue and others 2001). WNV has been classified into two lineages. Lineage 1 viruses have been isolated from Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas and are responsible for most reported cases of neurological disease in human beings and horses (Beasley and others 2004). In contrast, lineage 2 viruses have been found primarily in enzootic cycles in sub-Saharan Africa and typically have not been found to cause human disease. However, recent phylogenetic studies suggest the existence and circulation of at least two and possibly three distinct WNV lineages in central Europe (Bakonyi and others 2006). Horses are particularly susceptible to WNV infection and clinical presentation may include ataxia, muscle tremors, rear limb paresis and recumbency. However, unlike avian species, the viraemia in equids does not reach a level sufficient to infect feeding mosquitoes, therefore they are considered a dead-end host (Castillo-Olivares and Wood 2004).
