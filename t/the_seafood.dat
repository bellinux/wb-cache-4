Chincoteague is a major tourist destination on Virginia's Eastern Shore, with many coming to enjoy the beaches on Assateague Island.

5|$|In Mississippi, {{heavy rain}} from Juan flooded about 340homes and businesses, {{mainly in the}} {{southern}} portion of the state. High winds and waves damaged ports in Pass Christian and Long Beach. Several boats were damaged along the coast, and <b>the</b> <b>seafood</b> industry suffered losses. Beach erosion damaged coastal roads, leaving debris and marsh grass behind when the storm passed. The total storm cost in the state was estimated at $776,000. In neighboring Alabama, Juan only produced wind gusts of , which caused little damage, but the storm's rainfall contributed to Mobile recording its wettest October on record. The rains caused flooding along streets and low-lying areas, but property generally escaped unscathed. The flooding did cause locally heavy crop damage; some farmers lost 50% of their soybean crop, and the pecan crop was damaged after earlier being affected by Hurricane Elena. Damage in the state was minor, estimated at over $65,000.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before making}} landfall, the {{hurricane}} caused extensive damage in Louisiana, {{due in part}} to the hurricane's slow speed and close proximity to the state coast. Winds as high as 60mph (100km/h) brushed the coastline, causing extensive damage. Storm surge pushed coastal waters to near-record heights, inundating low-lying areas. Near Morgan City, Louisiana, 19people went missing after going on a fishing trip; they were later found marooned at Atchafalaya Basin. The schooner J.W. Clise was abandoned during the storm 135mi (215km) south of the Mississippi River Delta, though its crew was also later rescued. Storm surge peaked at 6.4ft (1.95m) above-average in western portions of Lake Pontchartrain. A bridge crossing Thunder Bayou, which extended west of the lake, was washed out by the waves. Similarly, a station at Calcasieu Pass reported a storm surge 4.8ft (1.46m) high. Conservation officials feared the disturbance would disrupt <b>the</b> <b>seafood</b> and muskrat production. After the storm, it was estimated 75,000muskrats were killed by the storm's effects. Offshore, Grand Isle was inundated by the strong waves. Around Houma, sugar cane crops were damaged. The hurricane was the strongest to impact Cameron since the tenth hurricane of the 1886 Atlantic hurricane season; strong gusts peaked at 70mph (115km/h), disrupting communication lines, thus isolating the city from other locations in the state. The high tides inundated town streets under 2ft (0.6m). Other areas extending from western Louisiana to Mobile, Alabama reported communication disruptions. In New Orleans, strong winds uprooted signboards and blew debris across the city streets. Several houses in Shell Beach and Delacroix Island were leveled by strong winds.|$|E

25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in <b>the</b> <b>seafood</b> industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on <b>the</b> <b>seafood</b> itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E

Products, such as fish oil and spirulina tablets are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).|$|E
