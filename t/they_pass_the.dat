5|$|The Doctor, Amy, River, and Father Octavian and his {{surviving}} clerics {{escape the}} approaching Weeping Angels when the Doctor destroys the gravity globe illuminating the cave they are in, {{allowing them to}} jump up into the gravity well of the crashed starship Byzantium. They scramble inside as the Angels start to follow, and the Doctor directs the group to the ship's oxygen factory, a forest contained within the ship. As <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> primary control room, the Doctor notices a familiar crack in its wall, leaking time energy that the Angels are being drawn to.|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{surface waves}} are {{propagating}} oscillations {{caused by the}} drag and friction from air moving {{across the surface of}} the water. This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water more or less in the direction of the wind. The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough; the distance between two crests is the wavelength. These waves are mechanical: as they approach, the water at a given point rise up and, as <b>they</b> <b>pass,</b> <b>the</b> water goes down, with parcels of water tracing a roughly circular path. The energy is passed along with the wave at a much greater speed than the motion of the water itself.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> Sun.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} the Sea of Monsters (Bermuda triangle), the Birmingham is {{destroyed}} by Charybdis and Scylla. Thinking Tyson and Clarisse dead, Percy and Annabeth sail in a lifeboat to a nearby island, where they narrowly escape the sorceress Circe, who turns men into guinea pigs. They steal the Queen Anne's Revenge from Circe's harbor and sail towards the island of Polyphemus. Along the way, <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> island of the Sirens and Annabeth confesses her fatal flaw, hubris, to Percy. When they reach the island, they find Grover, Clarisse, Tyson, and the fleece. Tyson and Percy work together to defeat Polyphemus and return the group to the mainland. Once there, Clarisse takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood with the Fleece. The remaining questers are captured by Luke and taken to the Princess Andromeda. Percy manages to contact Camp Half-Blood through an Iris Message and tricks Luke into admitting that he poisoned Thalia's tree, proving Chiron's innocence {{in front of the}} entire camp. Mr. D then sends Tantalus back to the Fields of Punishment. Luke duels Percy, beats him, and is about to kill the group, but before he does, Chiron and the his centaur relatives appear and rescue them. Returning to the camp, Chiron is given his job back and the Golden Fleece heals Thalia's tree. However, in the final pages, the Golden Fleece also revives Thalia Grace, putting another half-blood back into play for the Great Prophecy the gods fear so much.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of black}} blow fly maggots in maggot therapy is common. After the maggots have hatched, they are {{carefully}} monitored {{until they reach}} roughly 2 to 3mm in length; at this point they {{are ready for the}} next step. Within 24 to 36 hours of hatching, the maggots are tested for their sterility; if <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> rigorous tests, then they may be used in maggot therapy. These maggots are placed onto a sterile piece of gauze which is laid over the wound of the patient. The maggots will proceed through the gauze to the open wound, where they will then begin their work. When they are full-grown, they leave the wound and enter the gauze for the purpose of pupating. They are then removed with the waste gauze and disposed of properly.|$|E
25|$|English {{secondary}} schools are mostly comprehensive, although the intake of comprehensive schools can vary widely, especially {{in urban areas}} with several local schools. Nearly 90% of state-funded {{secondary schools}} are specialist schools, receiving extra funding to develop one or more subjects in which the school specialises, which can select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in the specialism (though relatively few of them have taken up this option). In a few areas children can enter a grammar school if <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> eleven plus exam; {{there are also a}} number of isolated fully selective grammar schools and a few dozen partially selective schools. A significant minority of state-funded schools are faith schools, which are attached to religious groups, most often the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|Worker polyethism {{occurs in}} P. exigua colonies and {{separates}} labor based on age of individual wasps. The wasps work inside the nest when young and slowly begin foraging more as they mature. After {{the emergence of}} workers in large colonies, some foragers become specialized in delivering specific types of material to the nest. The gatherers of nest material do not build the nest themselves; instead, <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> foraged materials onto designated builders, who proceed to distribute the materials to colony workers. This specified behavior is called “task fixation” and seems to make wasps more efficient in their gathering skills. However, it also makes the fixated foragers less responsive to changes in supply and demand of materials. P. exigua colonies have {{a greater proportion of}} nonfixated wasps than fixated wasps, therefore the species as a whole can successfully adapt to resource changes.|$|E

25|$|The Federal TVET agency delegates {{regional}} TVET {{agencies or}} regional education bureaus to implement their decisions, procedures and guidelines, including accrediting providers and issuing Certificates of Competence (CoC). TVETs can prepare their own curricular to meet local conditions. TVETs aim to provide marketable and entrepreneurial skills and previously provided {{one or two}} year certificates and a three-year diploma for students who had passed grade 10 exams. Now students may enter the TVET system at levels 1 to 4 depending on their grade 10 results. Students entering at level 1 can progress to higher levels if <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> outcome based occupational assessment taken {{at the end of}} each level. Students who have passed through the TVET system and worked for two years can apply to a public university. TVETs have expanded to train students without formal qualifications and these courses can last from a few days to a year or more.|$|E
25|$|Students are {{admitted}} after <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> Higher Secondary Exam (HSC exam). In earlier days students partake in entrance examinations, a separate {{one for each}} department. But now students need to partake under unit of different faculty. This has been a contentious issue, as {{there used to be}} only one exam for each faculty, after which students would be allocated to departments according to their result and choice of program. As a public university, University of Rajshahi's tuition fees are relatively low; nevertheless, a hike in admission fees, during the 2006–07 session, have drawn criticism from student bodies. As of 2007, the university awards a total of 340 scholarships, whose annual value is around 1.1million taka. In addition, there are merit awards given by residential halls, departments and the university itself. Students are also eligible for the Prime Minister's Gold Medal award. All colleges of the northern and southern regions of the country used to be affiliated with University of Rajshahi. However, the administration of colleges across the country was taken over by the National University when it was established in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah treats {{also the}} laws of the shofar (iii.2); the horn of the cow may not be used (iii.2); the form of the trumpet for Rosh ha-Shanah, the fast-day, and Yovel is {{determined}} (iii.3-5); injuries to the shofar and the remedies are indicated (iii.6); in times of danger the people that pray assemble in pits and caves (iii.7); <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> house of worship only on the outside while the trumpets sound (iii.7); they are exhorted to be firm by being reminded of Moses' uplifted hands in the war with the Amalekites (iii.8). In such times the deaf-mutes, insane, and children are legally unfit for blowing the trumpets. Johanan ben Zakkai established that the shofar trumpets be blown at Jamnia and the surrounding places even if the festival fell on the Sabbath, while at one time this was done only in the Temple (iv.1); he also fixed the lulav outside of the Temple for seven days, and forbade the eating of new grain {{on the second day of}} Passover (iv.2); he extended the time for examining witnesses until the evening, and had them come to Jamnia even in the absence of the av bet din (iv.3). The Mishnah then treats of the order of the prayers (iv.4), of the succession of the Malkuyot, Zikronot, and Shoferot, of the Bible sentences concerning the kingdom of God, Providence, and the trumpet-call of the future (iv.5), and of the leader in prayer and his relation to the teki'ah (iv.6); descriptions of the festival are given in reference to the shofar (iv.7); then follows the order of the traditional trumpet-sounds (iv.8); and remarks on the duties of the leader in prayer and of the congregation close the treatise (iv.9).|$|E
