50|$|All {{hierarchical}} models {{indicate that}} brand awareness {{is a necessary}} precondition to brand attitude or brand liking, which serves to underscore the importance of creating high levels of awareness {{as early as possible}} in a product or brand life-cycle. Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights {{about the nature of the}} target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the advertising effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a funnel. Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.|$|E
40|$|Targeting {{customer}} segments with tailored promotional {{activities is}} {{widely recognized as}} a potential successful strategy to gain more of existing customers’ discretionary spending. Most previous research focuses on the selection of promising customers for targeting and typically ignores the decision of which specific product category to select for inclusion in such <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions.</b> We present an innovative two-stage decision-support tool that assists managers in selecting promising categories from large assortments for inclusion in <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions.</b> To empirically test {{the performance of the}} derived segment-level category promotions, we implemented and validated our decision-support tool in cooperation with a major home-delivery grocery retailer using a large-scale controlled field experiment. Results point to a very successful campaign: our redemption rates are among the highest reported in both academic and managerial literature. What is more, <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> clearly outperform non-targeted ones in terms of coupon redemption. Yet, not all <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> change purchase behavior successfully. We show that customers who use a coupon where the most influential “draw" category was promoted engage in true cross-category purchases, resulting in an average extra boost in overall shopping basket size of about 10 percentage points (in €-amount and number of SKUs) vis-à-vis a control group. We therefore show that our procedure is an important decision-support tool that can help managers with making smart decisions regarding which category to promote for which customer. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} new approach to derive recommendations for segment-specific, targeted marketing campaigns on the product category level. The proposed methodological framework serves as a decision support tool for customer relationship managers or direct marketers to select attractive product categories for their target marketing efforts, such as segment-specific rewards in loyalty programs, cross-merchandising activities, targeted direct mailings, customized supplements in catalogues, or customized promotions. The proposed methodology requires cus- tomers' multi-category purchase histories as input data and proceeds in a stepwise manner. It combines various data compression techniques and integrates an opti- mization approach which suggests candidate product categories for segment-specific targeted marketing such that cross-category spillover effects for non-promoted categories are maximized. To demonstrate the empirical performance of our pro- posed procedure, we examine the transactions from a real-world loyalty program of a major grocery retailer. A simple scenario-based analysis using promotion responsiveness reported in previous empirical studies and prior experience by domain experts suggests that <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> might boost profitability between 15...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} regulatory focus {{in the context of}} the Michelangelo phenomenon, a process whereby interaction partners shape one another's goal pursuits. We advanced predictions regarding the intrapersonal and interpersonal consequences of <b>target</b> and partner <b>promotion</b> orientation using the concepts of target-goal congruence, partner-goal congruence, and interpersonal match. We used data from four complementary measurement methods-self-report questionnaires, daily diary records, partners' ratings of ideal-relevant interaction behaviors, and coders' ratings of interaction behaviors-and using both target- and partner-reports of model criteria. Consistent with predictions, (a) <b>target</b> <b>promotion</b> orientation is associated with the elicitation of partner affirmation, (b) partner promotion orientation is associated with the display of partner affirmation, and (c) partner affirmation partially mediates the associations of <b>target</b> and partner <b>promotion</b> orientation with <b>target</b> movement toward the ideal self.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} whether dynamic targeted pricing based on consumer purchase history could benefit a practicing firm even when consumers are "strategic" in that they actively seek to avail themselves of a low price in the future. Such strategic behavior {{on the part of}} consumers has been shown in the literature to render such dynamic targeted pricing unprofitable, even for a monopoly firm. We show that dynamic targeted pricing can benefit competing firms, when they actively pursue customer recognition based on consumer purchase history. This is because in order to pursue customer recognition, competing firms need to price high to "screen out" price-sensitive consumers and hence price competition is moderated. As a result, all competing firms can become better off with targeted pricing than without even when consumers behave strategically. Interestingly, because of this competition moderation effect, the paradoxical outcome occurs where dynamic targeted pricing may not benefit a monopolist, but it may benefit competing firms. We also show that dynamic targeted pricing can expand the market such that social welfare unambiguously improves. Dynamic pricing Price discrimination <b>Targeted</b> <b>promotions...</b>|$|E

40|$|With retail {{competition}} {{at an all-time}} high, today’s retailers must {{find new ways to}} attract consumers and inspire high levels of customer loyalty. Due to the scarcity of time and advancement in technological and strategical innovations, it becomes inevitable for the retailer to come up with various new ways of promoting the brands and their products in-store at the time of decision making. Innovative retail set up can create a truly differentiated in-store experience with fun, interactive tools that put a wealth of information at customers ’ fingertips during the right time of purchase decision.

40|$|At {{sporting}} mega-events, {{there is}} increasingly intense competition {{off the field}} of play {{as well as on}} it, with big brands battling it out for the attention of consumers. Some of these brands are associated with official event sponsors; others are associated with commercial rivals that have no official association with events such as the Olympic Games or the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. The latter group is increasingly engaging in what is termed “ambush marketing”-for instance, by seeking to deliberately persuade or mislead consumers into thinking they have an official association with a sporting mega-event. The emergence of ambush marketing emanates from the centrally controlled sale of a small number of rights packages by bodies such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and FIFA, which effectively exclude non-rights holders from associating with an event. Brands that have no official legal right of association often therefore seek to access similar benefits to official sponsors by engaging in a range of activities, including <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> and the creation of rival tournament properties. The focus of this article is fourfold: (1) to explain how ambushing has emerged, (2) to define ambush marketing, (3) to identify various types of ambushing, and (4) to discuss some of the management issues and challenges posed by ambush marketing...|$|E
40|$|Smart meters hold {{a lot of}} promise. Smart meters {{will enable}} demand side {{management}} for small electricity users through real time pricing and smart appliances. Smart meters will help with the integration into the electric power system of micro-generation and micro-storage, and of hybrid and all-electric vehicles. Smart meters will also yield unprecedented amounts of information about consumer behaviour. At present, the typical power company knows its clients ’ monthly electricity use. In the future, power companies could know electricity use per minute – if so desired. In other markets, similar revolutions in data availability have led to market segmentation. This can be benign, {{as in the case}} of <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> (e. g., supermarkets) or pricing (e. g., airlines) but in other cases regulators had to step in to prevent exclusion (e. g., health insurance).

40|$|Despite the {{negative}} consequences associated with gambling, few problem gamblers seek professional help. This study aimed to examine awareness of professional sources of help and help-seeking behaviour amongst regular and problem gamblers. Australian gamblers (N = 730) were recruited from the general population, multicultural gambling venues, and gambling helplines and treatment services. Surveys measured awareness of professional help services, help-seeking behaviour and motivators and barriers to seeking help. Gamblers demonstrated low awareness of professional help services. Problem gamblers born in Australia or who were divorced {{were more likely to}} seek help. Problem gamblers who were reluctant to seek help due to a desire solve the problem on their own and feeling ashamed for themselves or their family pride {{were more likely to have}} overcome these barriers to seek help. However, significant barriers related to denial of problem severity and concerns about the ability to access low cost services that cater for multicultural populations predicted a lower likelihood of having sought help. Public education should aim to de-mystify the treatment process and educate gamblers about symptoms of problem gambling to reduce shame, stigma, and denial and encourage help-seeking. Ongoing education and promotion of help services is required to increase awareness of the resources available, including <b>targeted</b> <b>promotions</b> to increase awareness of relevant services among specific populations...|$|E
