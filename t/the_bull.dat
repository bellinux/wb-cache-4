5|$|It {{is likely}} that Native Americans living along the Columbia River as early as 10,000years ago visited <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run {{watershed}} in search of food. Within the past few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around Mount Hood, near {{the upper part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching for sources of clean drinking water, chose <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow through a large pipe to the city in 1895.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, {{predecessor}} of the Portland Water Bureau, began {{a search}} for a superior drinking water source. The committee, led by Henry Failing, commissioned Isaac W. Smith, an engineer and surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system could deliver clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison signed a proclamation creating a protected area, <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a diversion dam on <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At {{about the same time as}} the Smith survey, a small farming community, at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of <b>the</b> <b>Bull</b> Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like Gresham and Sandy. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.|$|E
25|$|The {{first round}} of the playoffs for <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> was against <b>the</b> New Jersey Nets, a team led by Keith Van Horn, Kendall Gill and Sam Cassell. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> swept <b>the</b> Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more {{challenging}} with the Charlotte Hornets stealing game two from <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> at <b>the</b> United Center, and tying the series 1–1. But <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> easily defeated <b>the</b> Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> as they went up against the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Bulls.</b> <b>The</b> Pacers gave <b>the</b> <b>Bulls</b> no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. <b>The</b> <b>Bulls</b> prevailed and beat the Pacers 88–83, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship.|$|R
