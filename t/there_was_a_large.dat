5|$|Approximately 15,000 people {{protested the}} fourth {{anniversary of the}} war (March 2007). For the fifth anniversary, the Iraq Body Count Exhibit placed red and white flags in the South Park Blocks, {{signifying}} who had died between the Americans and Iraqis. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> fifth-anniversary protest and parade against the Iraq war ("thousands of protesters", March 2008), and {{a high school student}} protest against the war was held in March 2008, with 400 protesters.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in {{addition}} to its success as a fishing port, Esbjerg established its position as one of the country's major export centres. Before World War II, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> butter factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employing some 150 workers while after the war the town developed agricultural industries, especially for meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300. Latterly owned by Danish Crown and employing 500, the plant closed in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.|$|E

5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{playing field}} {{known to the}} locals as [...] "the rec". <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{football}} pitch, which is currently unused. The children's play area has both adult and toddler swings, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> slide, rocking chairs, and roundabout and a see-saw. The park <b>is</b> enclosed by <b>a</b> low fence. At the end of [...] "the rec", <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tennis club, with a club house and 5 tennis courts, 3 of which are under flood-lights.|$|R

5|$|Tropical cyclone {{data was}} {{gathered}} at 6 hour intervals throughout the season. Even though most intensity assessments were estimates via the Dvorak Technique, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> research mission for Tropical cyclogenesis in the Pacific. A NOAA research mission investigated Hurricane Jimena and gathered a few surface observations. Track forecasts were slightly {{more accurate than}} the past three years; intensity forecasts were comparable to the previous three seasons.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> consensus {{within each of the}} 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{system of}} {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, {{as did the}} Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell {{into a state of}} neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.|$|E
5|$|Nablus costume {{was of a}} {{distinctive}} style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing souk ("market"), in late 19th century, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ("robe"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow {{on the front and}} back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh ("square chest piece").|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one else but them were responsible for the death, the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian was the {{youngest}} of three children born to an Armenian father and a French mother in Akron, Ohio. His father, Michael, had come to the United States from Turkey in 1915, fleeing the Armenian Genocide during World War I and settling in part of the country where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> Armenian population. Despite his mother's protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age, and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class. He was hired by Akron's Board of Education in the eighth grade to patrol his school's grounds at night to deter vandals.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam {{ships in the}} 1840s created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. In 1850, with {{the closure of the}} prison, seven 8-inch (22.3 cm) guns were mounted along the walls in brick emplacements, but there were concerns about the defences and two earthwork auxiliary batteries were built just alongside the castle to house additional guns. In 1856, {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> review of the fleet along the Solent, attended by Queen Victoria and numerous tourists. Naval gunboats launched a mock attack on the castle, which responded by firing a volley of forty 8-inch guns, causing chaos among the crowds watching around the base of the fortification.|$|E
5|$|The {{open cup}} nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against {{potential}} predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically {{of three to}} five eggs, is incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, {{although there has been}} a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of the evidence against him could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|When the Corregidor {{entered the}} minefield, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{explosion}} on {{the starboard side}} of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly {{that there was no}} time for large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|A dam on Nescopeck Creek was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E

5|$|As the peloton {{approached}} the Côte de la Redoute, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> crash. Among the riders to crash were two previous {{winners of the}} race, Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans, as well as Fränk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), Nicolas Roche (Sky), Mathias Frank (IAM) and Yukiya Arashiro (Europcar). Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of}} the climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted to get back into the peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E
5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland cattle in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s cattle were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland Cattle Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred cattle in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland cattle are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of Highland cattle for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|E
5|$|Sabotage {{operations}} were ordered from Berlin {{in the late}} autumn of 1940, but actual work did not start until early 1941. The first {{operations were}} unsuccessful. A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was aborted, as the timing device was faulty. In February <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> explosion in the North Tunnel, and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield. In June 1941, however, the British intelligence foiled a new attempt, by a German agent, to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship. Another attempt failed when Plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but {{was not able to}} bring the explosive. It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed. In January 1942, two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip.|$|E
