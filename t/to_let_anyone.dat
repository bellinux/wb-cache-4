He {{serves as a}} foil personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistic as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome {{in contrast to the}} traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him.|$|E

'Doom' claims that he brought this team together to assist him in defeating Ultron's conquest of the world. Although Doom's true plan is revealed at the story's conclusion to be a desire to take Ultron's place, after the Avengers are able to free the Asgardians to assist them against Ultron's former drones, the Vision reveals that this Doom is actually the Doombot who worked with him in the Avengers A.I., convincing the Doombot to abandon his plan by noting that simply following Doom's example ignores the more positive aspects of Doom's history as the man who refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> else dictate his terms.|$|E

500|$|After {{the season}} ended, Berg {{took his first}} trip abroad, sailing from New York to Paris. He settled in the Latin Quarter in an {{apartment}} that overlooked the Sorbonne, where he enrolled in 32 different classes.

Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it [...] "alive" [...] and refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> else touch it. When he was finished with it, he would consider the paper [...] "dead" [...] and anybody could read it. In January 1924, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.|$|E

While he lived, Fox refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> else {{complete}} the Marathon of Hope, having promised to finish it himself once he recovered. Steve Fonyo, an 18-year-old who suffered from the same form of cancer and who also had a leg amputated, sought in 1984 to duplicate Fox's run, calling his effort the [...] "Journey for Lives". After leaving St. John's on March 31, Fonyo reached the point where Fox was forced to end his marathon at the end of November, and completed the transcontinental run on May 29, 1985. The Journey for Lives raised over $13 million for cancer research.|$|E
500|$|Mercury informs Thespis {{that the}} {{substitute}} gods have received many complaints from mortals because {{some are not}} performing their functions, and others' ill-judged experiments have wreaked havoc in the world below. [...] For instance, Timidon, the replacement for Mars, is a pacifist and a coward; the substitute for Hymen refuses to marry anyone; and the ersatz Pluto is too tenderhearted <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> die. [...] Daphne, who plays the muse Calliope, comes to Thespis and claims, based on a bowdlerised edition of the Greek myths, that Calliope was married to Apollo. [...] She points out that Apollo, played by Sparkeion, is the brother of Diana (played by Sparkeion's wife, Nicemis). [...] Thespis decides that Sparkeion is married to Daphne while they are gods, but his marriage to Nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a private}} high school in Ontario, in 2027.

The students in his class are Arianna Belle-Essai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal, Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook and all of the students have school-issued computers, which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages.

500|$|Assigned {{to produce}} the serial was Dixon of Dock Green {{producer}} Joe Waters. Preliminary filming on Quatermass began in June 1973 at Ealing Studios where special effects designer Jack Wilkie and his assistant, Ian Scoones, shot model footage, for part one of the serial, of a space station with astronauts working on its hull. At this point the BBC got cold feet about the project; they had become concerned {{about the cost of}} mounting the production and had been refused permission to film at Stonehenge, one of the locations at which Kneale had envisaged the Planet People would gather to be reaped by the alien force. Kneale recalled that Stonehenge [...] "had become Big Business and the place was like a factory with tourists there from dawn to dusk... they weren't going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> go near it". Kneale also felt that the BBC were unhappy with the script believing it [...] "didn't suit their image at that time; it was too gloomy". In the end, it was decided during summer 1973 that for financial reasons the BBC would not proceed with the production. However the BBC still had an option on the script until 1975, and they retained this until it expired.|$|E
500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we have never been able <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E
500|$|Costa {{communicated with}} Walt Disney {{at least twice}} a week for nine months, but almost {{exclusively}} via telephone because the producer feared that her personality or physical appearance would influence his vision of Aurora if they were to meet in person too soon. They first met when Costa was recording [...] "Once Upon a Dream", Walt's favorite song in the film. When Costa asked Walt why he decided to cast her as Aurora out of all the actresses who auditioned, the producer explained that it was because her singing voice sounded [...] "like an extension of speech." [...] Walt advised Costa to [...] "paint with [...] voice", as well as refuse <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> demonstrate her lines for her. Walt also instructed Costa to avoid catching a cold, eat a warm meal two hours prior to her recording sessions, exercise her vocal chords, and get nine hours of sleep every night. Walt and Costa developed a special father-daughter relationship. Aurora's supervising animator Marc Davis would often observe and sketch Costa while she worked in order to incorporate her mannerisms into the character. Costa worked closely with actresses Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy, the voices of Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, respectively, with whom she became good friends, while declaring the utmost respect for actress Eleanor Audley, voice of Maleficent. She also recorded with actor Bill Shirley, voice of Prince Phillip, admitting to having had a crush on him. Costa cites the scene in which Aurora and Phillip meet as her favorite. Schumann, the composer responsible for discovering Costa, died before the film was completed.|$|E

Otherwise, he plays well the part of boy grateful to be safe in the countryside, building a warm relationship with Pépé (played by veteran character actor Michel Simon) and Mémé (Luce Fabiole), his simple and likeable surrogate grandparents. They form a strong and mutually affectionate bond.|$|R

2500|$|Many times Howard {{was upset}} {{that he was}} not getting the ball enough, and he felt that Kobe Bryant was {{shooting}} too much. Moving forward, Howard said he needed to [...] "bring it" [...] and dominate in more ways than just scoring. In the following game against Memphis, he had only two points and four rebounds in 14 minutes before he sat {{out the rest of the}} game after aggravating his shoulder injury. He returned the following game showing no ill effects from the injury. On January 30, Howard left the Phoenix Suns game early after re-aggravating his shoulder. He was listed as day to day and missed subsequent games. Bryant said that Howard [...] "worries too much" [...] and [...] "doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> down", and urged him to play through the pain when Pau Gasol was sidelined with a torn plantar fascia.

Presley even shared his mother's bed [...] "up until Elvis was a young teen," [...] simply because the family was so extremely poor that they couldn't afford the luxury of two beds. According to Elaine Dundy, [...] "it was agony for her to leave her child even for a moment with anyone else, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> else touch Elvis." [...] Presley himself said, [...] "My mama never let me out of her sight. I couldn't {{go down to the}} creek with the other kids."

[...] Morey {{went on to say that}} Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons. Of her character's development, Morey explained [...] "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I think when we first met her, she was quite closed off and didn't want <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> in fear of hurting them." [...] Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life. She explained [...] "She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow. She's very focused on that for now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer {{is based}} on the 1985 novel by Patrick Süskind, which has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Süskind {{reportedly}} thought that only Stanley Kubrick and Miloš Forman could do the book justice and refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> else adapt it to film. [...] Bernd Eichinger, the film's producer, read the novel when it was first released and immediately approached Süskind, who was also a friend of his, to obtain the film rights — Süskind refused. In 2000, Süskind relented and sold Eichinger the rights. Eichinger had to take out a personal loan because the supervisory board of Constantin Film refused to approve the selling price. He is rumored to have paid €10 million for the film rights. The author had no involvement in the project. Artist/director Julian Schnabel wanted to direct a film version of the novel and wrote a script based on the novel. However, Eichinger, who owned the rights to the novel at the time, disliked Schnabel's stream of consciousness-driven narrative of the story and that project was never materialized. Schnabel eventually transferred his unique approach of his Perfume script into his 2007 film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.|$|E
