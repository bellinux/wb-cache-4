5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E
5|$|That the {{practice}} of sewing murderers of <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> sacks and throwing them in the water was still an active type of punishment at Cicero's time, {{at least on the}} provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus wrote to his own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BCE had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E

5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} Stranger {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita {{temporarily}} resided at Castle Tata, {{the home}} of Count Esterházy, until a suitable permanent exile could be found. Malta was mooted as a possibility, but was declined by Lord Curzon, and French territory was ruled out due {{to the possibility of}} Zita's brothers intriguing on Charles's behalf. Eventually, the Portuguese island of Madeira was chosen. On 31 October 1921, the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja, where the Royal Navy monitor HMS Glowworm was waiting. They finally arrived at Funchal on 19 November. Their children were being looked after at Wartegg Castle in Switzerland by Charles's step-grandmother Maria Theresa, although Zita managed to see them in Zurich when her son Robert needed an operation for appendicitis. The children joined <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Madeira in February 1922.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, Segrè paid {{a summer}} visit to California {{to study the}} {{short-lived}} isotopes of technetium, which did not survive being mailed to Italy. While Segrè was en route, Benito Mussolini's fascist government passed racial laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was now rendered an indefinite émigré. The Czechoslovakian crisis prompted Segrè to send for Elfriede and Claudio, as he now feared that war in Europe was inevitable. In November 1938 and February 1939 they made quick trips to Mexico to exchange their tourist visas for immigration visa. Both Segrè and Elfriede held grave fears for the fate of <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> Italy and Germany.|$|E

This thesis has created opportunities for South Sudanese participants to narrate their stories and perspectives, which are essential in exploring cultural changes in societies with strong oral communication traditions. The study seeks to develop a nuanced understanding of South Sudanese experiences of parenting and being <b>parented</b> <b>in</b> South Sudan, and how these differ to <b>their</b> <b>parenting</b> practices <b>in</b> Australia. Through increased cross-cultural knowledge, awareness and understanding, policymakers and service providers can offer improved family support...|$|R

Mary Rose, a lonely, thirty-year-old woman with the {{responsibility}} of looking after her father and brother, leaves Church on an April day in the 1940s. She goes to a Schrafft's outlet and becomes acquainted with a man there ordering food. When she sees him there the next day, the pair begin dating and eventually marry. Together, they have four children. Their first three children, Jacob, Michael, and Annie live with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> an Irish-Catholic community on Long Island.|$|E

5|$|The typical clutch size is two eggs, 20.3 × 15.1mm in size, {{which are}} pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are {{concentrated}} around the wider end. Both sexes share the incubation duties, with each parent incubating for stints of around 25minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including brindled white-eyes, rufous fantails, and other golden white-eyes. From laying {{it takes about}} two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are altricial, in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks fledge around 1014 days after hatching. After fledging they may remain with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> small groups for some time.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>in</b> such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E

5|$|Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on {{the surface}} on open ground, with a smaller number nesting {{under the cover of}} {{vegetation}} (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> <b>In</b> the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E
