5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket.</b> He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E
25|$|Several {{items of}} {{clothing}} worn by McQueen's Bullitt received {{a boost in}} popularity thanks to the film: desert boots, a trench coat, a blue turtleneck sweater and, most famously, a brown <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> with elbow patches.|$|E

The video shows the camerlengo branding himself with the Illuminati diamond and confessing that he himself is Janus, and who set in motion the night's chain of events in order to sabotage the Vatican. He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.|$|E
500|$|Buffy's dream {{includes}} several references to {{past and future}} episodes. In a dream sequence in the season three finale, Faith says [...] "Little Miss Muffet counting down from 7-3-0"; foreshadowing Dawn's arrival two years later in season five. This number appears (as 7:30) on a clock in Buffy's dream in [...] "Restless". Buffy says, [...] "It's so late." [...] Tara replies, [...] "Oh... that clock's completely wrong." [...] A year has now passed, making the previous number of days to her arrival incorrect. When Buffy leaves the room, Tara tells her, [...] "Be back before Dawn." [...] The character Dawn appears in the next episode. Tara's words to Buffy, [...] "You think you know what's to come, what you are. You haven't even begun." [...] are repeated by Dracula to Buffy in the following episode ("Buffy vs. Dracula"). In Xander's dream, Giles and Spike swing together on a swing set, with Spike wearing a <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket.</b> Giles comments, [...] "Spike's like a son to me." [...] In [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] (season six), when the characters lose their memories, Spike wears the same <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> and believes Giles is his father.|$|E
500|$|... "The Big Bang" [...] {{deliberately}} revisits several {{scenes from}} {{earlier in the}} series. The first scene in the episode mirrors the start of [...] "The Eleventh Hour". As the Doctor rewinds through his life, he sees events which relate to [...] "The Lodger", but which were not shown in that episode. His conversation with Amy during the events of [...] "Flesh and Stone", however, appeared in that episode. It was shot in extreme close-up but the Doctor's <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> is still visible, which the present Doctor in that episode had previously lost to the Weeping Angels.|$|E
5000|$|But other diarists were {{a little}} more serious about the task in hand and veteran Daily Mirror {{journalist}} Donald Zec recalled being in {{a certain amount of}} awe when dropping by the Diary as a rookie reporter. “They generally wore horn-rimmed spectacles, hairy <b>tweed</b> <b>jackets</b> and corduroys and called each other 'Old Boy' a lot” wrote Zec. “Just to hover in the room where they worked - or plotted - was instructive.” ...|$|R
50|$|Show hunter horses {{should be}} shown with manes plaited (braided) and ears, faces and legs trimmed. Between nine and 13 plaits is traditional, {{although}} the number may {{vary depending on the}} horse's conformation. Tails may be pulled or plaited, although most professionals prefer to pull. Tack should be workmanlike, with bridles having a flat noseband and plain browband. Handlers should wear <b>tweed</b> <b>jackets,</b> shirt and tie, buff or canary breeches and black leather boots with garter straps.|$|R
50|$|English country jackets usually include waxed and quilted jackets. The {{traditional}} {{style is}} dark olive green with a brown corduroy collar {{which is based}} on the original colour palette used when they were first produced, which also included navy as opposed to dark olive green. A gilet is also a popular style of country <b>jacket.</b> <b>Tweed</b> <b>jackets</b> and coats are also worn to protect against weather due to the durability of the material. Fleece jackets and gilets have also become part of country attire in Britain.|$|R
500|$|The title character, {{played by}} Rowan Atkinson, is a childish buffoon who brings various unusual schemes and contrivances to {{everyday}} tasks. He lives {{alone at the}} address of Flat 2, 12 Arbour Road, Highbury, and is almost always seen in his trademark <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> and a skinny red tie. He also usually wears a digital calculator watch. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally only a few mumbled words which are in a comically low-pitched voice. His first name (he names himself [...] "Bean" [...] to others) and profession, if any, are never mentioned. In the first film adaptation, [...] "Mr." [...] appears on his passport in the [...] "first name" [...] field, and he is shown employed as a guard at London's National Gallery.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} episode, the Eleventh Doctor still wears his {{previous}} incarnation's costume, but costume designer Ray Holman {{stated that the}} costume was broken down and distressed. Over {{the course of the}} first episode, he would find his own identity and pick out his defining costume. Smith tried {{on a wide variety of}} things to find a look he would feel comfortable and confident in and would identify his Doctor. Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman believed that the <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> was [...] "a bit old for him" [...] but showed that he was a [...] "professor and student at the same time" [...] and gave him [...] "that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority". Smith suggested a bow tie, which Holman and others did not approve of, but once he had put it on they decided they had the costume. Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other influences included the [...] "element of a professor" [...] and [...] "big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones". The men's clothing store Topman reported that their bow tie sales had risen 94% for the month of April 2010, connected to when the series began airing.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor's initial outfit, chosen {{within the}} {{narrative}} of [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] from an array of clothes found in a hospital, is a brown <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> with elbow patches, bow tie, braces/suspenders, black trousers and black, ankle-high boots. He has a fondness for bow ties and fezzes, proclaiming them as [...] "cool." [...] The details of the outfit vary, switching from a braces and bow tie combination in red to the same in blue. In later stories, a green military coat makes {{its way into the}} Doctor's ensemble, occasionally replacing the Harris jacket. On other occasions he does not wear a coat and wears a bow-tie and dress shirt. After the Doctor loses his original <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> in the episode [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] he replaces it with a plain brown jacket which he wears until the Christmas special [...] "A Christmas Carol", which aired the Christmas after the eleventh Doctor's first series. In this episode the Doctor wears his most famous [...] "Prince of Wales check" [...] <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> which he wears, with some switching to a green military coat, until parting ways with Amy and Rory in [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan".|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally {{used for}} upper-class country {{clothing}} like shooting <b>jackets,</b> <b>tweed</b> became popular among the Edwardian middle classes who associated {{it with the}} leisurely pursuits of the elite. Due to their durability <b>tweed</b> Norfolk <b>jackets</b> and plus-fours were a popular choice for hunters, cyclists, golfers and early motorists, hence Kenneth Grahame's depiction of Mr Toad in a Harris tweed suit. Popular patterns include houndstooth [...] associated with 1960s fashion, Windowpane, gamekeeper's tweed worn by academics, Prince of Wales check originally commissioned by Edward VII, and herringbone.|$|R
50|$|Canadian turnout {{rules are}} {{somewhat}} in-between the US and UK rules.

Whips are not allowed, spurs are optional. Bridles may be double, pelham, snaffle or Kimblewick. Browbands must be of leather and may have some ornamentation, but cannot be coloured, sequined, or solid white. The formal shadbelly is not seen in open competition as often as it is seen in the USA, other than in breed-specific competition. Horses may be braided.|$|R
5000|$|On {{his return}} from {{military}} service in 1946, Aston became the first League referee to wear the black uniform with white trim which became the standard for referees. Up to that point, referees wore <b>tweed</b> <b>jackets</b> over white shirts with French cuffs, and pants akin to golf knickers. He later explained that when he spied a black flight jacket {{in the window of}} a war surplus store, he was delighted with the wonderful assortment of pockets. He immediately bought a couple of the jackets, thinking the pockets would serve him well as a referee. He changed to black knickers, kept the white shirt, and wore the new black flight jacket, creating the black uniform with the apparent white [...] "trim." ...|$|R
2500|$|He began {{stealing}} {{books from}} the Lindley Library of the Royal Horticultural Society in Pimlico under the name Victor Santoro some time after June 2004, when an inventory was last taken. He also used the pseudonym [...] "David Fletcher". He moved books around to hide the gaps he left when removing books, which he concealed under his <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket.</b> Staff later realised that he signed in when he had both arms free, but never signed out.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Big Bang", the Doctor briefly dons a fez, stating, [...] "I wear a fez now, fezzes are cool." [...] This began {{a running}} gag with [...] "cool" [...] headgear, {{including}} a Stetson hat, a Victorian-era top hat, and the recurring fez. After appearing in Victorian period clothing throughout [...] "The Snowmen", the Doctor rejects his <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> ("The Bells of Saint John") {{in favour of}} a purple-brown cashmere frock coat {{and a variety of}} waistcoats, and generally more sober colours of shirt and bow tie. Amy Pond's reading glasses, which were left behind with the Doctor after Amy and Rory's departure in the episode [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", are also occasionally worn.|$|E
2500|$|Gauci {{recalled}} that {{about two weeks}} before the bombing he had sold the Yorkie trousers to a man of Libyan appearance, who spoke a mixture of Arabic, English, and Maltese with a Libyan accent. Gauci remembered the sale well, he told the police, because the customer didn't seem to care what he was buying. He bought an old <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket</b> that Gauci had been {{trying to get rid of}} for years, a blue Babygro, a woollen cardigan, and a number of other items, all different styles and sizes. He described the man as [...] "5 ft 10 in, muscular, and clean-shaven" [...] (U.S. News & World Report, November 18, 1989). A Scottish police artist flew to Malta to compile a detailed sketch of the man.|$|E

2500|$|The Eleventh Doctor's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described as appearing like [...] "an Oxford professor", with a <b>tweed</b> <b>jacket,</b> red or blue striped shirt, red or blue bow tie, black or grey trousers with red or blue braces, and black boots. He maintains [...] "Bow ties are cool" [...] even when his companions do not agree, and is delighted to meet Dr Black, the first man who agrees with him, in the episode [...] "Vincent and the Doctor". As a running gag, he exhibits attraction to unusual hats, like a fez, a pirate hat and a stetson, often only to have them destroyed by River Song shortly afterwards. Starting {{in the second half of}} series 7, the Eleventh Doctor reverted to wearing a frock coat, similar to those worn by his predecessors, with a waistcoat and black trousers, black braces, an off-white shirt, bow tie and brown boots. He also added round-rimmed glasses that belonged to former companion Amy Pond.|$|E

60|$|The {{opening of}} Parliament {{gave me some}} {{peculiar}} moods. I began to feel {{more and more like}} a branded sheep. We were sworn in in batches, dozens and scores of fresh men, trying not to look too fresh under the inspection of policemen and messengers, all of us carrying new silk hats and wearing magisterial coats. It is one of my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of silk hats in the smoking-room of the National Liberal Club. At first I thought {{there must have been a}} funeral. Familiar faces that one had grown to know under soft felt hats, under bowlers, under liberal-minded wide brims, and above artistic ties and <b>tweed</b> <b>jackets,</b> suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, from under silk hats of incredible glossiness. There was a disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good Parliamentary style.|$|R
50|$|Dunn & Co. {{was founded}} in 1887 by George Arthur Dunn, a Quaker, who started by selling hats {{on the streets of}} Birmingham. Forty years later he had two hundred hat shops and as many franchises in other stores.

5000|$|During {{one of her}} {{stays in}} London, Dorothea met divorcee Mrs Evelyn Spottiswoode, wealthy heiress of the Dewar's whisky company. A lesbian who {{preferred}} to dress in man-style <b>tweed</b> <b>jackets</b> and brogues, her Rooksnest House and estate were close to the Macnee home in Lambourn. [...] In 1929 the Macnee’s separated when Daniel went to India to take up an appointment at the Bombay racecourse, [...] while Dorothea and her son Patrick moved to live with Evelyn at Rooksnest. [...] Although Daniel returned to live in College House in 1931, the Macnee’s never again lived together, although they maintained contact and never divorced. At Rooksnest, Evelyn Spottiswoode and Dorothea Macnee lived with several other lesbians including Evelyn’s former lover, a large household staff, and up to 45 dogs. [...] Patrick was encouraged to address her mother’s new partner as ‘uncle Evelyn’, Evelyn paying for his schooling, first at Summer Fields and then at Eton.|$|R
