5|$|As a multirole aircraft, <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> as a common type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles {{to serve in the}} interceptor role.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>tornado,</b> roughly 1,000 people lived in the hamlet of Chappaqua. Five homes and three barns were {{destroyed}} by <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> and two people, 80-year-old Mrs. Mary Hibbs and an unknown woman, were killed; six additional people were injured. Orchards {{in the path of}} <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> were completely destroyed and greenhouses were leveled. The severity of lightning during the storm caused many women to faint according to The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> in Comfrey {{there was}} {{uncertainty about the}} town's long-term survival.

5|$|Many stations, {{including}} WIAT, WBMA/WCFT/WJSU, WTVY (channel 4) in Dothan and WSFA (channel 12) in Montgomery, showed {{television cameras}} capturing the event as <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> moved east-northeast across {{the western and}} northern suburbs of Birmingham around 6:00p.m. CDT (2300 UTC). Several suburbs in the area were severely damaged by the massive tornado as it tore through {{the west side of}} Birmingham, resulting in multiple fatalities. The suburbs of Concord, Pleasant Grove, and McDonald Chapel were devastated by <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> as it moved northeast, flattening entire neighborhoods. As <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> entered the Birmingham city limits, it devastated the Pratt City neighborhood, destroying numerous homes and apartment buildings. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> then struck the suburb of Fultondale, causing EF2 damage to homes and businesses before dissipating east of Fultondale.

5|$|The fourth tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 2:45a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, {{some of which}} were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> dissipated. No injuries were reported as a result of <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> and damages amounted to $30,000. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of {{the outbreak}} touched down around 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> {{crossed the}} Ohio River {{a third time}} back into Indiana and across the {{southern}} fringes of Evansville. Here, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> ripped directly through the Eastbrook Mobile Home Park, obliterating numerous mobile homes and killing 20 people. Of about 350 mobile homes in the park, 100 were destroyed and another 125 were damaged. The coroner reported {{that most of the}} victims were probably killed instantly, many by spine and skull fractures. Several bodies were carried almost two hundred yards. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> then crossed into Warrick County, Indiana at the Angel Mounds State Historic Site. Several permanent homes were destroyed in this area, along with many others {{on the north side of}} Newburgh. Past Newburgh, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> reached its peak intensity (high-end F3) as it tore through an industrial park near Paradise. Further northeast, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> passed just south of Boonville and caused a fatality in a mobile home. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> then tore directly through the small community of DeGonia Springs, tossing vehicles and destroying homes. Some of the homes in the community were leveled, and three people were killed in a mobile home in this area. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> began to rapidly weaken as it passed just south of Tennyson, and then dissipated as it crossed into Spencer County, Indiana. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> damaged or destroyed 500 buildings, killed 25 people, and injured 230 others.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> entered Hale County west of Sawyerville, {{continuing}} {{to move through}} sparsely populated rural areas. North of Sawyerville, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> strengthened to EF3 intensity as it was crossing Alabama State Highway 14. Reaching estimated maximum winds of , <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> continued on its northeast track, crossing County Roads 18 and 21, Alabama State Highway 69, and County Road 29 as it moved south and east of the small communities of Harper Hill and Ingram. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> caused extensive structural damage through this area, consisting of many mobile homes and site-built homes being either heavily damaged or destroyed. A church in the area was heavily damaged, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and thousands of trees were downed as well.|$|E
5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor {{roof and}} tree damage, which was rated as EF0intensity. However, as <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E
25|$|A {{squall line}} {{affected}} the central Florida peninsula on April 4, and both tornadoes originated as waterspouts over the Gulf of Mexico. <b>The</b> two <b>tornadoes</b> were spawned {{from a single}} thunderstorm that entered the Tampa Bay region, and they {{are believed to have}} represented a <b>tornado</b> family. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>tornadoes</b> were poorly forecasted by the U.S. Weather Bureau, since meteorological analysis did not indicate the presence of an adjacent surface low, which would have enhance conditions for <b>tornadoes.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>Tornado</b> Watch was not released for the central Florida area prior to <b>the</b> <b>tornadoes.</b>|$|R

5|$|After 12:17UTC, the tornado's {{position}} fluctuated between Benton and Washington {{counties in}} northwestern Arkansas. Permanent houses were damaged and mobile homes were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped while many other power poles were snapped. Two {{people were injured}} following {{the destruction of a}} mobile home within the Ozark National Forest in Benton County, while another person was injured west of Tontitown, Arkansas in Washington County. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> finally dissipated northwest of Tontitown at 12:27UTC after causing four deaths and ten injuries. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> caused $1.835million in damage, which was the sixth costliest total during <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the storm}} had blown down {{telegraph}} lines in the area, two riders immediately set off for Roberts, ten miles to the south, and sent messages into St. Paul with news of <b>the</b> <b>tornado.</b> Altogether, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> and the subsequent fires that raged throughout the following night destroyed the entire business district along {{with more than half}} the residences in town, which combined added up to more than 300 buildings. The only significant surviving structures were the Lumber and Roller Mills located {{on the banks of the}} Willow River, the latter of which was narrowly missed by <b>the</b> <b>tornado,</b> the town's public school and the Catholic Church, which acted as either makeshift shelters or morgues. Only the extreme northwestern and southeastern portions of the city were spared. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition— it was impossible to tell if they died from <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> or from being trapped and burned alive.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tornadoes,</b> {{in their}} first season, won the Can-Am League Championship, {{sweeping}} the Quebec Capitales three games to zero.

5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
50|$|On October 29, 1929, <b>the</b> Bulldogs and <b>Tornadoes</b> {{met again}} to play, in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Prior to 1929, the Bulldogs played as the Pottsville Maroons and the teams played for their still loyal fans at the Maroons' Minersville Park. This time however, <b>the</b> <b>Tornadoes</b> lost 6-0 {{by way of}} a 4-yard {{touchdown}} run from Boston's Tony Latone. On October 3, <b>the</b> <b>Tornadoes</b> held <b>the</b> Staten Island Stapletons to a scoreless tie at Thompson Stadium. During that game the Stapletons were within scoring distance three times, but to no avail. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Tornadoes</b> only penetrated <b>the</b> Staten Island 20-yard line once.|$|R

5|$|In {{order for}} <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> {{to perform well}} as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, <b>the</b> <b>Tornado</b> differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} from Kyle in South Carolina {{peaked at}} 6.35inches (161mm) in Edisto Beach, with the precipitation resulting in minor urban flooding. In and around St. Stephen, flooding reached several feet in depth in roads and buildings; there, {{a nursing home}} had to be evacuated because of flooding. High waters in Manning severely damaged 17mobile homes, forcing about 50people to move to shelters. Ten car accidents were reported in Florence. The tropical storm spawned an F2 tornado in Georgetown that remained {{on the ground for}} about 1.25miles (2km). At its peak strength, <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> overturned five mobile homes and a car. <b>The</b> <b>tornado</b> destroyed seven homes and damaged 106buildings, 28severely. Eight people were injured by <b>the</b> <b>tornado.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nearby Hillcrest Elementary School also {{sustained}} {{severe damage}} from <b>the</b> <b>tornado.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>tornado</b> hit, students from both schools {{who were not}} injured were relocated by emergency personnel to Hillcrest Baptist Church, adjacent to the schools and which was not damaged, {{in order to meet}} up with shocked parents. Emergency personnel also rushed to the school to send the most seriously injured to local hospitals and provide treatment on the scene to others.|$|E
