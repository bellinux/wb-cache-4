Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that}} the natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought she would need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> the series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E
5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects {{that he may be}} growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As a result of <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally cynical and rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his speech before he met Mana.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} unleashing of the king's power, Veigue's Force of Ice {{goes out of}} control, causing his friend Claire to become imprisoned in an ice pillar. One year after this, Veigue is {{contacted}} by Eugene and Mao, who help free Claire from the ice pillar. Shortly after this, Claire is taken away by agents of Agarte, who is searching for the most beautiful Huma woman in the land. Veigue heads out with Eugene and Mao to rescue Claire, eventually joining forces with Annie, Tytree and Hilda. Upon reaching the royal capital of Balka, the group find Agarte using her Force of the Moon to resurrect Geyorkias {{in the belief that}} the spirit will save her kingdom from the chaos consuming it, having been prompted by Zilva. When summoned, Geyorkias declares his intent to destroy the Huma population, forcing the group to attack and destroy his physical form. With Geyorkias gone and Claire rescued, the group part ways, but are brought back together as outbreaks of racial violence from both Huma and Gajuma begin destabilizing Karegia, caused by the hatred the summoned Geyorkias released after his defeat. To quell the violence, the group decide to summon the other Sacred Beasts in the hope of purging Geyorkias' hatred from the land. After rescuing Agarte from a Huma mob, it is revealed that Agarte switched bodies with Claire. In the aftermath, Agarte reveals that she originally captured Claire so she could switch bodies and realize her love for her bodyguard Milhaust, as relations between Huma and Gajama are taboo. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> events has caused Agarte to lose her Force abilities, leaving Claire and Agarte trapped in each other's bodies.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Trauma is a {{well-known}} leading cause of unnatural death and disability in South Africa. Internationally the trend is moving toward systematised care. AIM: To revise <b>the</b> <b>Trauma</b> Centre Criteria <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trauma</b> Society <b>of</b> South Africa and align these with the terminology and modern scope of emergency care practice, using best-care principles {{as a prelude to}} <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> systems in South Africa. METHODOLOGY: Revision of existing documents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trauma</b> Society <b>of</b> South Africa, the Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa and the Critical Care Society of Southern Africa, where these are relevant to <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>trauma.</b> <b>The</b> committee attempted to harmonise these criteria with the goals of the World Health Organization essential trauma care guidelines for trauma centres and trauma systems. Wide expert consultation was undertaken to refine the criteria before final compilation. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Four levels <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> care facility are outlined, with the criteria focusing on the trauma-specific requirements of the facilities and their place in <b>the</b> greater <b>trauma</b> system. Accreditation <b>of</b> hospitals according to the criteria will allow for appropriate transfer and designation of patient destination for trauma patients and will improve the quality of care provided. The criteria address structural, process and human resource requirements and medical aspects for the accreditation of various level <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> centre. CONCLUSION: There is a great opportunity to apply best practice criteria to improve <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> in South Africa and improve patient outcome...|$|R
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. <b>The</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which <b>the</b> <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> World War II and its aftermath in the former Yugoslavia are dealt with {{in the work of the}} post-punk group Laibach. The Laibach project challenges traditional memories by combining seemingly incompatible images of Nazism, Stalinism, Hitler, etc. The result is a forced reworking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> totalitarian past. The renewed focus on past traumas encourages critical awareness and active participation in the process of memory for the individual. Laibach's work encourages awareness not only of the past, but also of existing state systems. By complicating the desire to forget the past, Laibach fosters an understanding of the interrelatedness of history and the present. Beyond exploring Laibach's provocations, this thesis also discusses similar aspects of projects in German artistic and intellectual culture to examine how these individuals continue to work through the problematic past of World War II...|$|R

40|$|Reflecting on <b>the</b> otherness <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> and its vexed {{relationship}} to representation, this article considers some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> writing <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> in Michael Cunningham’s 2005 novel Specimen Days; a text {{that offers a}} particularly powerful literary imaging of culture’s disavowals that return to haunt. The article focuses on how the text conveys <b>the</b> workings <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> structurally and stylistically through repetition, paratactic syntax {{and the use of}} multiple narrator voices, also considering the novel’s distinctly self-reflexive discussion of the ethical implications of fictional representations <b>of</b> <b>trauma.</b> <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> the reader’s relation to aesthetic representations <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> and to <b>the</b> wider debates concerning ethical responses to <b>trauma</b> that <b>the</b> novel seems to question are also discussed. The article argues that Cunningham offers an innovative writing <b>of</b> <b>trauma</b> that foregrounds <b>the</b> <b>traumas</b> <b>of</b> everyday violence, social injustice and oppression, whilst also making links to <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> cultural <b>trauma</b> that typically achieve more public recognition.
