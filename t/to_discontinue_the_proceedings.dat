40|$|Article 54 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement {{constitutes}} {{an example of}} transnational application of the {{ne bis in idem}} principle which means that no one should face more than one prosecution for the same offence or that no one should be punished twice for the same offence. ECJ had the opportunity to clarify the scope of application of this article in Gözütok and Brügge case. In this case, the Court has stated that purely procedural matters should not become an obstacle for the implementation of the area of freedom, security and justice.
