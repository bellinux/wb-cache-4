500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as a hard worker, and stated that the [...] "first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he's a hard worker. When you look at him, you can <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones." ...|$|E
500|$|So William of Champlitte and Geoffry of Villehardouin [...] {{departed}} from the host, and took with them about a hundred knights, and {{a great number of}} mounted sergeants, and entered into the land of Morea, and rode onwards till they came to the city of Modon. Michael heard that they were in the land with so few people, and he collected together a great number of people, a number that was marvellous, and he rode after them as one thinking they were all no better than prisoners, and in his hand. And when they heard <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was coming, they refortified Modon, where the defences had long since been pulled down, and there left their baggage, and the lesser folk. Then they rode out a day's march, and ordered their array with as many people as they had. But the odds seemed too great, for they had no more than five hundred men mounted, whereas on the other part there were well over five thousand. But events happen as God pleases; for our people fought with the Greeks and discomfited and conquered them. And the Greeks lost very heavily, while those on our side gained horses and arms enough, and other goods in very great plenty, and so returned very happy, and very joyously, to the city of Modon.|$|E

500|$|Within the {{contemporary}} American literary scene Griswold {{became known as}} erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive. As historian Perry Miller wrote, [...] "Griswold was about as devious as they came {{in this era of}} deviousness; did not ample documentation prove that he actually existed, we might suppose him... one of the less plausible inventions of Charles Dickens". Later anthologies such as Prose Writers of America and Female Poets of America helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power. Even as they tried to impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and [...] "constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth". Even his friends knew him as a consummate liar and had a saying: [...] "Is that a Griswold or a fact?" [...] Another friend once called him [...] "one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met". Author Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning [...] "the poor little innocent fishes" [...] to avoid his [...] "Griswold Hook". A review of one of Griswold's anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia Saturday Museum on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe, asked: [...] "What will be [...] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{taking over}} Shannan West Circuit, Lu named Wang, Han, Zhang, Jin, and Li the prefects of the prefectures in the circuit, {{but did not}} allow them to go to their posts. [...] He also grew {{suspicious}} of people, and lost the heart of his followers. [...] He was particularly suspicious of Wang and Han due to their close friendship with each other, but tried to endear them by treating them well. [...] Wang and Han, however, could <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suspecting them, and therefore they, after enticement by the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi, fled to Chengdu in fall 884, along with Zhang, Jin, and Li, to join Tian's troops. [...] Tian thereafter sent forces to attack Lu and defeated him. [...] Lu then abandoned Xingyuan and fled east.|$|E
2500|$|Moctezuma {{was soon}} taken hostage on November 14, 1519, {{as a safety}} measure by the vastly outnumbered Spanish. Another reason for his sudden capture was news that Moctezuma {{received}} {{from one of his}} messengers which Cortés was present for. It was reported to Moctezuma that at least eight hundred more Spaniards in thirteen great ships had arrived on the coast. Eye witnesses at the time report Cortés as visibly shaken. Cortés had been communicating with the crown that he had the entire situation under control and was practically running the city of Tenochtitlan. When these new Spanish ships had arrived, they would clearly be able to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had in fact not been running the city and as a result would be thrown in prison, ending his campaign in Mexico. Therefore, Cortés made the decision to abruptly abduct the warrior king. Only with a knife to his throat could Cortés ensure his cooperation. [...] According to all eyewitness accounts, Moctezuma initially refused to leave his palace but after a series of threats from and debates with the Spanish captains, and assurances from La Malinche, he agreed to move to the Axayáctal palace with his retinue. [...] The first captain assigned to guard him was Pedro de Alvarado. Other Aztec lords were also detained by the Spanish. The palace was surrounded by over 100 Spanish soldiers in order to prevent any attempt at rescue.|$|E
