5|$|Cockatoos are a {{distinctive}} lineage of parrots notable for their crests {{and lack of}} colour in their plumage.

5|$|Extremophile archaea {{are members}} of four main {{physiological}} groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles.

Nonetheless, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> useful starting point for classification.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try {{to gain access to}} females. Females can conceive after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> year and a half old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins {{toward the end of the}} wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|Mary, however, is {{depicted}} as authentic rather than artificial, detesting fashionable life rather than yearning after it.

Even though she is older and intellectual instead of young and pretty, Mary asserts her right to sexual desire rather than sublimating it.|$|E
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches in that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
