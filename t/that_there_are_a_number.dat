5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact triggers for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of possible triggers, each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E

5|$|To be specific, MS {{involves}} {{the loss of}} oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the myelin sheath—which helps the neurons carry electrical signals (action potentials). This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, {{the breakdown of the}} axons of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques. This could indicate <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences. Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal {{increase in the number of}} astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons. A number of lesion patterns have been described.|$|E

Hugh Nibley also states that many non-biblical names found in the Book of Mormon {{resemble}} words from ancient Hebrew (e.g., [...] "Sariah", [...] "Jarom", and [...] "Josh"). Some names, like [...] "Alma", are attested Hebrew names. Milton R. Hunter and Thomas Ferguson allege that Hebraic fragments and roots appear discernible in Nephite/Mulekite names such as [...] "Zarahemla". These names are often interpreted as evidence in favor of the Book of Mormon, since Smith's knowledge of Hebrew was limited to names found in the Bible.|$|E

2500|$|Wildfire is a {{major concern}} across the Coconino National Forest. Despite the {{abundance}} of green vegetation throughout the forest, the region is classified as a high desert.

The lack of any significant rainfall during the spring and early summer combined with the high temperatures and strong winds that are commonplace during that time of year results in fire danger that is usually defined as [...] "very high" [...] or [...] "extreme" [...] during the months of May through July. The danger of a major wildfire is increased by the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of cities and communities surrounded by forest land. Restrictions on campfires and smoking in the forest are common during peak fire season. Occasionally, the fire danger will become so great that the forest is closed to all public entry until substantial precipitation is received to minimize the danger of a stray spark setting off a destructive wildfire.|$|E
