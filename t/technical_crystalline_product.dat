40|$|Identification {{of product}} {{requirements}} and quality, {{together with the}} management of production are key issues in chemical engineering. Quality control of <b>crystalline</b> <b>products</b> {{is part of the}} quality of many industrially manufactured products like paper, paintings, medicines and fertilizers. In most crystallization cases, quality is described with the size, polymorph, shape and purity of the crystal. The chemical composition, hydrodynamics and driving force, together with the operating temperature are in a key position when the properties of a <b>crystalline</b> <b>product</b> are controlled with the crystallization process. This study concentrates on managing the identified properties of a <b>crystalline</b> <b>product</b> with the control of a driving force. The controlling of the driving force can be based on the change of solubility or the change of concentration. Solubility can be changed with temperature, pressure and an antisolvent. The concentration of crystallizing compound, the solute can be changed with the evaporation of the solvent and {{with the addition of a}} reagent. The present study focuses on reagent addition and temperature change as methods of changing the level of the driving force. Three control structures for direct control of supersaturation are built, one for cooling crystallization and two for reactive crystallization. Closed loop feedback control structures are based on the measurement of the solute concentration with attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The details of the reagent feed are analyzed with experimental studies and with results of computational fluid dynamic simulations of the inert particle pulse in the premixer and inert particle injection to the mixing tank. Nucleation in conditions of controlled reactive crystallization is analyzed with Nielsen’s equation of homogeneous nucleation. The resulting control systems, based on regulation of supersaturation, can be used to produce the desired polymorph of an organic product. The polymorph composition of product crystals is controlled repeatably with the decision of a set value of supersaturation level...|$|R
