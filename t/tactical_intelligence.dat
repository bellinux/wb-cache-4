5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on October 8, optimistic field reports expecting an {{imminent}} Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter {{plans for the}} attack. Adan would now attack {{in the direction of}} the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence,</b> aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E

25|$|January 18, 2017 - Bukit Aman's Special <b>Tactical</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Narcotics Group (STING) seized RM6.7 {{million worth}} of drugs in a two-day raid at five {{different}} location here at Kuala Lumpur. However, this success was marred {{by the fact that}} seven out of eight traffickers caught were policemen, including an Assistant Superintendent (ASP) attached with the Bukit Aman's Criminal Investigation Department (CID). 75kg of syabu worth RM5.25 million and 7.4 million of heroin base worth RM740,000 were seized during the operation.|$|E
25|$|Nalbandian was an all-court {{player and}} a very clean ball striker. He used powerfully struck, sharply {{accurate}} groundstrokes which had very low error-percentage. He had a decent, but not particularly dominating service game compared to top 20 players. His signature play was the wide drive that swings out of court on both sides, low and spinning. He could take high balls on the backhand and forehand side and return them with acute angles and low trajectories and used these skills with great <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both armies were sobered by {{the fierce}} {{fighting}} and many casualties, {{and realized that}} the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of {{the first year of the}} war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> was nil, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively. McDowell, with 35,000 men, was only able to commit about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, committed only 18,000.|$|E

25|$|Cannavaro is {{considered}} one of the greatest defenders of his generation, and of all time, winning the World Cup as Italy's captain, as well as the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year Award in 2006. Although he predominantly excelled as a centreback, due to his ability to read the game, he was also deployed as a right or left sided fullback on occasion, in particular under his Inter coach Héctor Cúper. This was made possible due to Cannavaro's <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence,</b> versatility, technical ability, ball playing ability, stamina, low centre of gravity and pace, which also enabled him to start plays from the backline after winning back possession.|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} players in his position, Rijkaard was a quick, strong, complete and tenacious defensive midfielder who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes, his work rate, positioning, his acute <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> and decision-making, as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game. Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Rijkaard was a strong tackler, with good technique and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession. He also possessed a powerful shot.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{military}} intelligence gathering, MID was also tasked with preventing sabotage and subversion by enemy agents or German sympathizers on US soil. Short of manpower, Van Deman relied on private groups which he organized into the American Protective League. He also provided security to government offices, defense plants, seaports, and other sensitive installations. He created a field organization in eight US cities which employed mobilized civilian policemen to perform security investigations. In France, MID provided operational intelligence to the American Expeditionary Force, and Van Deman created the Corps of Intelligence Police (forerunner of the Counter Intelligence Corps), recruiting fifty French-speaking Sergeants with police training. Thus, {{within a few}} months, he had created an intelligence organization that could support both domestic and <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> requirements.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. and ARVN units {{participating}} in Apache Snow knew, based on existing intelligence information and previous {{experience in the}} A Shau, that the operation was likely to encounter serious resistance from PAVN. Beyond that, however, they had little intelligence as to the actual strength and dispositions of PAVN units. The area was extremely remote and difficult to access. Aerial surveillance was difficult. U.S. battalion commanders had to generate their own <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> by combat patrols, capturing equipment, installations, documents, and occasionally prisoners of war to provide the raw data from which to draw their assessment of the North Vietnamese order of battle and dispositions. It was this time-consuming and hit-or-miss task force which characterized the main efforts of Colonel Honeycutt's 3/187th Infantry during the first four days of the operation.|$|E
25|$|A former left-back, Muntari later {{developed}} into a powerful, experienced, hard-working, and tenacious midfielder; although he is primarily known for his physical strength and combative playing style, he was also able to make notable improvements to his technical skills throughout his career. He also possesses a good left-foot, a powerful shot from outside the area, and is a solid passer of the ball. He primarily excels as a ball-winner, due to his energy, <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence,</b> and ability {{to break down the}} opposition's play; a versatile footballer, although he is usually deployed as a defensive, central, or box-to-box midfielder, he is also capable of playing as a left winger or even as an attacking midfielder. Due to his aggressive and hard-tackling style of play, however, he has also been criticised for his tendency to pick up cards.|$|E
25|$|At the Rethel {{meeting on}} 17 August Lanrezac also thought that Sir John French, whose BEF only {{consisted}} of four infantry divisions {{rather than the}} planned six, intended to use the British cavalry on foot (it is thought likely that he had misunderstood Sir John’s intention to keep his cavalry in reserve). Whereas Sir John wanted Sordet's French cavalry to cover the assembly of the BEF, Lanrezac wanted them to gather <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> and was told by Joffre’s {{deputy chief of staff}} Berthelot on 17 August that this took priority. Nonetheless Joffre ordered Sordet to move up to Namur and Louvain to try to prevent the Belgians falling back on Antwerp. GQG were unfairly angered at Sordet’s “dilatoriness”, even though his horses were too tired to do more than walk. Lanrezac demanded to Joffre on morning of 18th that he have use of Sordet’s corps.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 2009, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, {{a senior}} al-Qaeda leader in East Africa {{as well as}} a senior leader in Shabaab, al Qaeda's {{surrogate}} in Somalia, was killed by elements of U.S. Special Operations. According to a witness, at least two AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters strafed a two-car convoy. Navy SEALs then seized the body of Nabhan and took two other wounded fighters captive. JSOC and the CIA had been trying to kill Nabhan for some time including back in January 2007, when an AC-130 Gunship was called in on one attempt. A U.S. intelligence source stated that CIA paramilitary teams are directly embedded with Ethiopian forces in Somalia, allowing for the <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> to launch these operations. Nabhan was wanted for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, as well as leading the cell behind the 2002 Mombasa attacks.|$|E
25|$|Technical Air Intelligence Units {{operated}} in Japan {{after the end}} of the war, shifting from <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence</b> to post-hostilities investigations. General Hap Arnold ordered the preservation of four of every type of aircraft one of each for the USAAF, USN, RAF and museum collections. By the end of 1945 these were collected together at Yokohama Naval Base. One hundred and fifteen aircraft were shipped to the United States, with 73 going to the Army and 42 to the Navy. However, lack of funds, storage space and interest meant that only six aircraft were restored, flown and evaluated by the Army and only two by the Navy. Eventually, 46 complete aircraft were sent to various museums while the rest were scrapped. By early 1946 ATAIU-SEA in Singapore had collected 64 Japanese Army and Navy aircraft, most in flyable condition, for shipment to the UK. However, lack of shipping space prevented this operation and only four eventually arrived in England to be put in display in museums.|$|E
25|$|FFI units seized bridges, {{began the}} liberation of villages and towns as Allied units neared, and {{collected}} intelligence on German units in the areas entered by the Allied forces, easing the Allied advance through France in August 1944. According to a volume of the U.S. official history of the war, In Brittany, southern France, and {{the area of the}} Loire and Paris, French Resistance forces greatly aided the pursuit to the Seine in August. Specifically, they supported the Third Army in Brittany and the Seventh U.S. and First French Armies in the southern beachhead and the Rhône valley. In the advance to the Seine, the French Forces of the Interior helped protect the southern flank of the Third Army by interfering with enemy railroad and highway movements and enemy telecommunications, by developing open resistance on as wide a scale as possible, by providing <b>tactical</b> <b>intelligence,</b> by preserving installations of value to the Allied forces, and by mopping up bypassed enemy positions.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} with <b>tactical</b> technical <b>intelligence,</b> national level {{science and technology}} information tends to come less from capture of foreign equipment, and more from HUMINT or creative business relationships.
