500|$|Throughout {{the bidding}} process and {{leading up to}} the vote at the 117th IOC Session, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, {{particularly}} as its bid was the city's third in recent history (previous bids being for 1992 and 2008). London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest.

500|$|Though McCotter {{had decided}} to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the {{majority}} of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. McCotter argued that [...] "somebody either panicked or it was sabotage... My gut <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we got lied to by someone we trusted." [...] Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it [...] "caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection," [...] but McCotter rejected this as an [...] "idiotic line of thinking." [...] He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation. The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud.|$|E

[...] By mid-November, the campaign started receiving advice from political consultant Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial campaign. [...] Upon Friedline's advice, Trump assembled communications and campaign staff, and began planning events in strategic states. As a further step in organization, Trump set up a campaign website at the domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura's webmaster, Phil Madsen, to create an online community of supporters.|$|E

500|$|The {{usage of}} the safety car came under {{criticism}} from figures within the sport. Fernando Alonso disagreed with the decision to start under the safety car as he felt it prevented him from attacking Vettel, while Sauber technical director James Key thought his team was put at a disadvantage when Kobayashi could not defend against the quicker cars after the fifth safety car period. Martin Brundle, who competed in Formula One for twelve years, stated [...] "the fact that the drivers came in almost immediately for intermediate tyres <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> {{on the face of}} it, the safety car was out too long", and felt that the safety car [...] "should be a last resort, not a default option." [...] However, he recognised that FIA race director Charlie Whiting had to consider the driver's visibility, and inexperience using the Pirelli wet-weather tyres led to caution. Jarno Trulli however agreed with the FIA's decisions, in particular the length of the red flag delay: [...] "It was right to wait that long; track conditions had to improve {{in order to make the}} cars drivable again. They did everything right." [...] De la Rosa and di Resta also agreed with the decision to halt the race, and Whiting stating that [...] "when it rained it was quite clear we needed to stop the race." [...] Whiting went on to say that the opinions of the drivers were taken into account on the decision to halt the race, although he also considered the possibility of a suspension benefiting those drivers.|$|E
500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we made all the right choices in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E
