40|$|The objecitves of {{this study}} were, first, to {{describe}} <b>the</b> planning of <b>raw</b> material costs in the SME group of ornamental ceramics and souvenirs {{in the city of}} Malang. Second, to prove <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>raw</b> material cost control and provide alternative solutions to problems faced by the SME group of ornamental ceramics and souvenirs in the city of Malang, particularly the problem of controlling raw material costs. Data analysis method used in this study was a quantitative analysis using the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity). In this research, paid a special attention to the Group and Souvenir Decorative Ceramic SME in the city of Malang in terms of procurement of raw materials companies to buy raw materials in large quantities which in consequence, decreased <b>the</b> quality of <b>raw</b> materials. Decline in <b>the</b> quality of <b>raw</b> materials was a major concern, because <b>the</b> nature of <b>raw</b> materials was susceptible to high temperatures, so the company must takes extra care to maintain <b>the</b> quality of <b>raw</b> materials. Several possible solutions to this problem, were: a) Establishing proper purchases of raw materials including: determining the most economical purchase quantity and determine the Reorder Point (ROP). b) Making the calculation of the difference analysis of <b>raw</b> materials included: <b>the</b> differences in <b>raw</b> material prices, <b>the</b> quantity of <b>raw</b> material usage and <b>the</b> differences between <b>raw</b> material usage.

In addition there was <b>the</b> difference in <b>raw</b> materials’ unprofitable price. This was due to raw material price fluctuations. In terms of <b>raw</b> material usage, <b>the</b> deviation was not profitable.
