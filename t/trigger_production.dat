50|$|Another {{hypothetical}} {{mechanism is}} that TGFs are produced within the thundercloud itself, {{either in the}} strong electric fields near the lightning channel or in the static fields that exist over large volumes of the cloud. These mechanisms rely on extreme activity of the lightning channel to start the process (Carlson et al. 2010) or on strong feedback to allow even small-scale random events to <b>trigger</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two {{criteria}} for this technology to work effectively are enzyme stability and rapid kinetics (quick {{response to the}} trigger and recovery after removal of the trigger). Several strategies have been tested in type 1 diabetes research, involving the use of similar types of smart polymers that can detect changes in blood glucose levels and <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> or release of insulin. Likewise, there are many possible applications of similar hydrogels as drug delivery agents for other conditions and diseases.|$|E

50|$|While the {{mechanism}} of disease {{has yet to be}} fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that the process is begun with an autoimmune process of unknown cause that <b>triggers</b> <b>production</b> of p-ANCA. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until a pro-inflammatory trigger — such as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy. The <b>trigger</b> upregulates <b>production</b> of p-ANCA. Then, the large number of antibodies make it more likely that they will bind a neutrophil. Once bound, the neutrophil degranulates. The degranulation releases toxins that cause endothelial injury. Most recently, two different groups of investigators have demonstrated that anti-MPO antibodies alone can cause necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.|$|R

5000|$|... 20-HETE constricts human artery {{preparations}} by directly activating the receptor for thromboxane A2. While {{significantly less}} potent than thromboxane A2 in activating this receptor, studies on human cerebral artery preparations indicate that increased blood flow through these arteries <b>triggers</b> <b>production</b> of 20-HETE {{which in turn}} binds to thromboxane receptors to constrict these vessels and thereby reduce their blood blow. Acting in the latter capacity, 20-HETE, it is proposed, functions as a mediator regulating {{blood flow to the}} human brain.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{anorexia}} {{of infection}} {{is part of}} the acute phase response (APR) to infection. The APR can be triggered by lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans from bacterial cell walls, bacterial DNA, and double-stranded viral RNA, and viral glycoproteins, which can <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines. These can have an indirect effect on appetite by a number of means, including peripheral afferents from their sites of production in the body, by enhancing production of leptin from fat stores. Inflammatory cytokines can also signal to the central nervous system more directly by specialized transport mechanisms through the blood-brain barrier, via circumventricular organs (which are outside the barrier), or by triggering production of eicosanoids in the endothelial cells of the brain vasculature. Ultimately the control of appetite by this mechanism is thought to be mediated by the same factors normally controlling appetite, such as neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, histamine, norepinephrine, corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone).|$|E

30|$|Hyperglycemia {{triggers}} and amplifies {{a cascade}} of inflammatory responses. Hyperglycemia facilitates production of superoxide anions through activation of {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) oxidase [5, 6]. Superoxide anions in turn <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)- 1 β, IL- 6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α [7], which augment both inflammatory responses and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, insulin exhibits anti-inflammatory actions by reducing production of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species [8].|$|E

40|$|Complex {{interactions}} between pathogen and host occur {{during the course}} of most infectious diseases. Microbes sense the host environment and produce factors, such as toxins, that usually promote their growth and often lead to symptoms in the host.

40|$|The {{association}} between psoriasis vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid {{is due to}} the still unclear autoimmune process. The common place of action is dermo-epidermal junction or basal membrane zone (BMZ) with specific alterations for both diseases. Photochemotherapy (PUVA) as one of the therapeutic modality for psoriasis can <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of autoantibodies against antigens in BMZ in patients with subclinical bullous pemphigoid. Furthermore, PUVA therapy can alter immunological milieu and hence can contribute to the expression of bullous pemphigoid in patients with psoriasis. Cumulative dose of PUVA, sufficient for triggering blister formation is individually determined. We observed a bullous eruption compatible with bullous pemphigoid in a psoriatic patient treated with PUVA. We proposed the implementation of the term - psoriasis pemphigoides for this atypical, compound form of psoriasis, when typical bullous pemphigoid lesions develop in typical psoriasis. </p...|$|E

50|$|High {{levels of}} AASs, that mimic the body's natural testosterone, trigger the {{hypothalamus}} {{to shut down}} its production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Without GnRH, the pituitary gland stops releasing luteinizing hormone (LH). LH normally travels from the pituitary via the blood stream to the testes, where it <b>triggers</b> the <b>production</b> and release of testosterone. Without LH, the testes shut down their production of testosterone. In males, HCG helps restore and maintain testosterone production in the testes by mimicking LH and <b>triggering</b> the <b>production</b> and release of testosterone.|$|R
40|$|Sialic acids {{represent}} {{a family of}} sugar molecules derived from neuraminic acid that frequently terminate glycan chains and contribute to many biological processes. Already five decades ago, aberrantly high expression of sialic acids has been proposed to protect cancer cells from recognition and eradication by the immune system. Today, increased understanding {{at the molecular level}} demonstrates the broad immunomodulatory capacity of tumor-derived sialic acids that is, at least in part, mediated through interactions with immunoinhibitory Siglec receptors. Here we will review current studies from a sialic acid sugar perspective showing that tumor-derived sialic acids disable major killing mechanisms of effector immune cells, <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of immune suppressive cytokines and dampen activation of antigen-presenting cells and subsequent induction of anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, strategies to modulate sialic acid expression in cancer cells to improve cancer immunotherapy will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Word finding {{difficulties}} in children are typically characterised by search behaviours such as silence, circumlocution, repetition and empty words. Yet, how children’s word searches are constructed (including gesture, gaze and prosody) and the actions accomplished during interaction {{have not yet}} been researched. In this study, eightyear- old Ciara is interacting with her teacher in the classroom. 37 segments containing word searches were analysed according to the procedures used by conversation analysts. Ciara’s interactional resources include co-ordinated deployment of syntax, pitch height and downward gaze during solitary searching that assist the enterprise of self-repair. Gaze shift towards the teacher signals a transition relevance place, thus constituting a direct invitation for her to participate in the search. Ciara’s interactional resources include semantic category labelling, phonological self-cuing and pronominal substitution that supply valuable linguistic information to the teacher and <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of the searched-for item. Recommendations for language teaching and therapy are presented...|$|E
30|$|Cyanobacteria {{are known}} to produce a variety of {{protease}} inhibitors with a predominance of peptides and depsipeptides (Weckesser et al. 1996) synthesized via non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthetase pathways (Welker and von Döhren 2006). Although, the conditions that <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of so many structural variants at a single point of time in any given cyanobacteria have not been clearly understood, few {{studies have shown that}} production of protease inhibitors from laboratory cultures is affected by light, temperature, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. The serine protease-inhibiting peptide (anabaenopeptilide) content of Anabaena sp. was affected by environmental factors such as phosphate and light (Repka et al. 2004). The highest peptide concentrations were found at light intensities of 23  µmol m− 2  s− 1 and phosphate concentrations greater than 100  µg L− 1. Rohrlack and Utkilen (2007) showed that the production of anabaenopeptins and microviridins, both protease inhibitors, was linearly correlated with growth rate of their producer organism, Planktothrix.|$|E
50|$|Bartonellosis is {{a serious}} chronic {{bacterial}} infection shared by both cats and humans. Spinella found that one patient with bartonella henselae also had anti-cardiolipin antibodies, suggesting that bartonella may <b>trigger</b> their <b>production.</b>|$|R

[...] IL-12 is particularly important in the defense against M. tuberculosis; without it, M. tuberculosis spreads unhampered. IL-12 <b>triggers</b> <b>production</b> of more cytokines through T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, while also leading to mature Th1 cells, and thus leading to immunity. Then, with IL-12 available, Th1 cells and NK cells produce interferon gamma (IFN-γ) molecules and subsequently release them. [...] The IFN-γ molecules in turn activate macrophages.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} duty of any efficient {{memory system}} is to prevent long-lasting storage of poorly relevant information. However, {{little is known about}} dedicated mechanisms that appropriately <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of long-term memory (LTM). We examined the role of Drosophila dopaminergic neurons in the control of LTM formation and found that they act as a switch between two exclusive consolidation pathways leading to LTM or anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM). Blockade, after aversive olfactory conditioning, of three pairs of dopaminergic neurons projecting on mushroom bodies, the olfactory memory center, enhanced ARM, whereas their overactivation conversely impaired ARM. Notably, blockade of these neurons during the intertrial intervals of a spaced training precluded LTM formation. Two pairs of these dopaminergic neurons displayed sustained calcium oscillations in naive flies. Oscillations were weakened by ARM-inducing massed training and were enhanced during LTM formation. Our results indicate that oscillations of two pairs of dopaminergic neurons control ARM levels and gate LTM...|$|E
40|$|The gut flora is {{believed}} {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of RA. Peptidoglycan, a major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, is a candidate antigen because of its capability to <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of proinflammatory cytokines, to induce arthritis in rodents, and because of its presence in antigen-presenting cells in RA joints. We investigated whether the systemic and local antibody levels against a peptidoglycan–polysaccharide (PG–PS) are related to the presence and disease activity of RA. Significantly lower levels of systemic IgG directed against PG–PS were found in healthy females compared with healthy males, and systemic IgA levels specific for PG–PS were negatively correlated with age. Levels of systemic IgG directed against PG–PS were significantly reduced in RA patients compared with sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Local (synovial fluid) levels of IgG did not correlate with disease activity whereas synovial fluid levels of IgA correlated positively with disease activity. These data suggest that IgG in healthy people mediates protection against spreading of PG to non-mucosal sites...|$|E
40|$|Blood-brain barrier (BBB) {{failure occurs}} in many neuro-logical {{diseases}} and is caused {{in part by}} activation of proinflammatory factors including matrix metalloprotein-ases. Counterbalancing, “BBB protective ” cascades have recently been described, including NO-mediated interleu-kin 6 release by glia. Interleukin 6 {{has been shown to}} <b>trigger</b> <b>production</b> of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors such as 2 -macroglobulin (2 M). We hypothesized that BBB failure may result in increased 2 M release by perivascular astrocytes. This was initially tested in pa-tients undergoing iatrogenic BBB disruption by hyperos-motic mannitol for intra-arterial chemotherapy of brain tumors. Serum samples revealed significantly increased levels of 2 M at 4 h after BBB disruption by hyperosmotic mannitol. In parallel in vitro experiments, we observed a similar increase of 2 M release by astrocytes under con-ditions mimicking BBB failure and perivascular edema. For both experiments, protein analysis was initially per-formed by bidimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry followed by Western blotting immunodetec-tion. We conclude that, in addition to proinflammatory changes, BBB failure may also trigger protective release of 2 M by perivascular astrocytes as well as periphera...|$|E
