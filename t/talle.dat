2500|$|Deir el Qamar is {{a village}} in south-central Lebanon, five {{kilometers}} outside of Beiteddine, consisting of stone houses with red-tiled roofs. During the 16th to 18th centuries, Deir el Qamar was the residence of the governors of Lebanon. It is also notable for its 15th-century Fakhredine Mosque, Fakhreddine II Palace, and other historical palaces and administrative buildings. The 17th century Deir el Qamar Synagogue {{is also in the}} village, although closed to the public. During its peak, the city was the center of Lebanese literary tradition. It was the first village in Lebanon to have a municipality in 1864, and it is the birthplace of many well-known personalities, such as artists, writers, and politicians. It was the capital of the Druze Cancimat of Lebanon (1840-1860). One of the most important historical and religious sites in Deir El Qamar is Our Lady of the Hill known as Saydet El <b>Talle.</b> This Maronite church goes back to the 15th century. The legend says that there was a Druze Emir in Baakline looking at the hill of Deir El Kamar. He saw a light coming out of the hill. He gathered his soldiers and ordered them to go in the morning and dig in the land. He said to them: 'If you find an Islamic symbol, build a mosque. If you find a Christian symbol, build a church." [...] The soldiers went in the morning, dug in the land and found a rock with a cross on it. Under the cross, there was the moon and Venus. That was the sign that long time ago, there was a temple dedicated to the moon and Venus and later it became a church. Earthquakes and wars might be the reason for its disappearance." [...] The rock discovered by the soldiers can be found above the old gate of the church. A Byzantine column can be found inside the church.|$|E

Doze voluntários com aumento da cifose torácica, escoliose, protrusão de cabeça e ombros foram tratados com a técnica isostretching três vezes por semana em sessões de 1 hora cada. Foram divididos em dois grupos, segundo o número de sessões de tratamento que freqüentaram: grupo 1 (n= 8), mais de 30 sessões e grupo 2 (n= 4), menos de 30 sessões. Para a avaliação postural, os voluntários foram fotografados antes e após o tratamento no plano frontal {{anterior}} e posterior, no plano sagital ereto e em flexão anterior de tronco. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente, considerando o nível de significância de 5 %. No grupo 1, os resultados foram satisfatórios quanto às modificações no alinhamento do triângulo de <b>Talles</b> (&# 916;T) esquerdo (f= 0, 00), ângulo coxofemoral (f= 0, 00), ângulo tibiotársico (f= 0, 00) e alinhamento da coluna torácica (f= 0, 01). Nos indivíduos do grupo 2, os resultados foram satisfatórios quanto ao alinhamento do joelho esquerdo (f= 0, 03), &# 916;T esquerdo (f= 0, 00), &# 916;T direito (f= 0, 01), alinhamento da coluna torácica (f= 0, 03) e alinhamento da cabeça (f= 0, 02). A técnica de isostretching, nas posturas adotadas neste estudo, foi pois eficaz no alinhamento da coluna vertebral torácica nos dois grupos, bem como na melhora da flexibilidade no grupo 1; entretanto, não houve melhora nas assimetrias posturais no plano frontal, independente do número de sessões freqüentadas pelos sujeitos. The {{purpose was}} to assess the effects of the isostretching technique on postural changes. Twelve subjects with increased thoracic kyphosis, scoliosis, head and shoulders protusion were treated with the isostretching technique in three one-hour weekly sessions. Subjects were dividded into two groups according to the number of sessions attended: group 1 (n= 8), over 30 sessions; and group 2 (n= 4) attended less than 30 sessions. In order to assess postural changes, subjects were photographed before and after treatment at anterior and posterior frontal planes, at upright sagittal plane and at anterior trunk flexion.

Results revealed strong effects of within-word position on H location. Peaks tended to be timed earlier {{with respect to the}} end of the syllable when their associated syllables occurred later in the word than when they occurred earlier in the word. These results confirmed previous findings for other languages (Silverman & Pierrehumbert, 1990 for English; Arvaniti, Ladd, & Mennen, 1998 for Greek; and Ishihara, 2006 for Japanese; and Godjevac, 2000 for Serbo-Croatian) and for Spanish and Catalan (Prieto, van Santen, & Hirschberg, 1995 for Spanish; de la Mota, 2005; Simonet, 2006, Simonet & Torreira, 2005 for Catalan). A set of perception experiments suggested that tonal alignment patterns influence listeners’ judgments of word boundary location both in Catalan and in Spanish. Listeners were able to employ fine allophonic details of H tonal alignment due to within-word position to identify lexical items that are ambiguous for word-boundary position. The data is consistent with the view that prosodic structure plays an essential part in determining the temporal coordination of f 0 contours with segmental material.

(Rafael) Summary: In {{the western}} Mediterranean, deep water decapod {{crustaceans}} form a considerable {{fraction of the}} megafaunal biomass in the upper (US, 200 - 500 m) and middle slope (MS, 500 - 800 m), being also a very {{important component of the}} catches of the commercial fishery. In the Balearic Islands, they represent around 17 % in weight and 50 % in revenues of the bottom trawl fishery, which operates between 50 and 800 m depth. The most important species in terms of biomass is Aristeus antennatus, followed by a mixed category of shrimps (including Pandalidae and Pasiphaeidae), Parapenaeus longirostris, Geryon longipes and Nephrops norvegicus. Economically, A. antennatus is also the most important species, followed by N. norvegicus, the mixed category and P. longirostris. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse the community and population dynamics of the deep water decapod crustaceans off the Balearic Islands. The partial objectives are: (i) to study the short spatial and temporal patterns of the main populations of two nearby locations with different environmental regimes; (ii) to explore relationships between the main species abundances and the environmental conditions; (iii) to characterise the species assemblages in the slope trawl fishing grounds; (iv) to estimate ecological indicators, both at species and at community level, {{to assess the impact of}} fishing in these communities, and (v) to analyse the effect of new management measures to improve the selectivity and to reduce the fishing impact. Data have been obtained from different sampling strategies: (i) seasonal and annual scientific surveys (fishery-independent data), and (ii) directly from the fishing sector (fishery-dependent data). A third type of data was obtained from scientific selectivity pilot studies. During the scientific surveys and the pilot studies, abundance, biomass and length frequency distributions of all the species were collected. Biological information of A. antennatus, P. longirostris and Pandalidae were recorded during the scientific surveys, and during the seasonal surveys different environmental parameters were obtained. Fishery-dependent data came from daily sale bills and seasonal on board sampling monitoring of the bottom trawl fishery. In the pilot studies, information obtained was for landings and discards of two types of codends with different mesh shape (diamond and square) as well as revenues from landings. Univariate and multivariate techniques have been used to analyse the data, including analysis of variance; cluster, redundancy and similarity percentage analysis; non-parametric correlations; multiple regressions and general additive models. Indicators of the state of the main species and the ecosystem were computed for fishery- independent data (annual surveys) and fishery-dependent data (daily sale bills) and summarised by means of the Traffic Lights methodology. Size selectivity for the two codends tested was modelled using the generalized logistic curve and length at first catch was also calculated. The results show spatial and temporal differences for the species studied between the two locations analysed, in the Algerian (AsB) and Balearic (BsB) sub- basins. These differences are related to higher abundance of P. longirostris and A. antennatus in the BsB than in the AsB, while the opposite has been found for Pandalidae (except for one species). A better condition has been found for all the species in the BsB than in the AsB. The different environmental conditions between both locations (geomorphological structure, bottom characteristics, hydrographic factors and availability of potential trophic resources) can be on the basis on the differences found, with varied influence among species. In most cases, both reproductive period and condition show a marked seasonality, with spawning concentrated in summer, where the minimum values in the condition has been detected. The results obtained from the analysis of indicators show different trends for the US and MS assemblages. The state of the US and of its main target species, N. norvegicus, seem to have improved for the last years, probably related to a fishing effort decrease. However, other factors than fishing effort may affect this species as its worst state is found in the less exploited area. For the MS and its target species, A. antennatus, no clear trends were found for both sources of data (fishery-independent and fishery- dependent). This can be explained by the different species included in each analysis as well as the different temporal sampling periods covered, as in some cases, such as A. antennatus, the high seasonal variability of its population dynamics is not reflected in the annual surveys (once a year). When the two codends tested are compared, there is no difference in the catch composition or the yield between the two mesh shapes, although the percentage of total and commercial species discarded with a diamond mesh was higher than with a square mesh. At least in the short term, the escapement ratio and the economic loss with the diamond mesh were lower than with square mesh, but economic efficiency was no different between them. For all the main species compared, except one flatfish, size selectivity parameters were lower for the diamond than for the square mesh codend. Within the context of precautionary management, the introduction of the square mesh in the codend could be an appropriate and plausible measure to improve the state of the resources exploited by the deep water crustacean trawl fishery of the slope off the Balearic Islands and to reduce the impact of the fishery on the ecosystem. The knowledge derived from the present thesis provide relevant information about how the species traits are mainly affected by water masses, sediment characteristic, trophic resources and fishing, since they influence the bathymetric distribution, abundances, biological parameters and condition of decapod crustaceans at a local scale. To understand how environmental characteristics and fishing impact interact to change the species distribution and the dynamics of the populations and communities is a key point for a better assessment of the resources and for a better application of the Ecosystem-Based Approach Management in the Mediterranean deep water ecosystems. Resum: Al Mediterrani occidental, els crustacis decàpodes de profunditat formen una considerable fracció en la biomassa de la megafauna del talús superior (US, 200 - 500 m) i el talús mitjà (MS, 500 - 800 m), essent a més una part important de les captures de la pesca comercial. A les Illes Balears, representen aproximadament un 17 % en pes i un 50 % dels guanys de la pesqueria d’arrossegament de profunditat, que opera entre 50 i 800 m de fondària. L’espècie més important en biomassa és Aristeus antennatus, seguida d’una categoria de gambes mesclades (que inclou Pandalidae i Pasiphaeidae), Parapenaeus longirostris, Geryon longipes y Nephrops norvegicus. Des d’un punt de vista econòmic, A. antennatus és també l’espècie més important, seguida de N. norvegicus, la categoria de mescla i P. longirostris. L’objectiu principal d’aquesta tesi és analitzar la comunitat i la dinàmica poblacional dels crustacis decàpodes de profunditat de les Illes Balears. Els objectius parcials són: (i) estudiar els patrons espacials i temporals a petita escala de les principals poblacions de dues zones properes, amb diferents règims ambientals; (ii) explorar les relacions entre l’abundància de les principals espècies i les condicions ambientals; (iii) caracteritzar les associacions d’espècies en els caladors d’arrossegament del talús; (iv) estimar indicadors ecològics, tant a nivell d’espècies com a nivell de comunitat, per avaluar l’impacte de la pesca en aquestes comunitats i (v) analitzar l’efecte de noves mesures de gestió per millorar la selectivitat i reduir l’impacte de la pesca. Les dades s’han obtingut a partir de diferents estratègies de mostreig: (i) campanyes científiques estacionals i anuals (dades independents de la pesqueria) i (ii) directament del sector pesquer (dades dependents de la pesqueria). Un tercer tipus de dades s’han obtingut mitjançant estudis pilot de selectivitat. Durant les campanyes científiques i els estudis pilot, es va recollir informació de l’abundància, biomassa i distribució de la freqüència de <b>talles</b> de totes les espècies. Durant les campanyes científiques, es recollí informació biològica d’A. antennatus, P. longirostris i Pandalidae i durant les campanyes estacionals s’obtingueren diferents paràmetres ambientals. Les dades independents de la pesqueria foren fulles de venda diàries i mostratges estacionals a bordo de la flota d’arrossegament. En els estudis pilot, es recollí informació pels desembarcaments i els rebutjos, amb els dos tipus de cops de diferent geometria de malla (ròmbica i quadrada), així com els guanys dels desembarcaments. S’han utilitzat diferents tècniques univariants i multivariants, incloent l’anàlisi de variància; anàlisi cluster, de redundància i el percentatge de similitud; correlacions no paramètriques; regressions múltiples i models additius generalitzats. Se calcularen els indicadors d’estat de les principals espècies i de l’ecosistema per les dades independents de la pesqueria (campanyes anuals) i les dades dependents de la pesqueria (fulles de venda diàries) i es resumiren utilitzant la metodologia dels semàfors. La selectivitat dels dos cops utilitzats es modelà utilitzant la corba logística generalitzada i es calculà la talla de primera captura. Els resultats mostren diferències espacials i temporals per les espècies estudiades entre les dues zones analitzades, a la sub-conca algerina (AsB) i la balear (BsB). Aquestes diferències són una major abundància de P. longirostris i A. antennatus a la BsB que a la AsB,|$|R
