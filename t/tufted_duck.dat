5|$|The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve, {{southeast}} of the town centre {{and close to the}} Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, shoveller, pochard, <b>tufted</b> <b>duck,</b> grey heron and mute swans.|$|E
5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, <b>tufted</b> <b>duck,</b> gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include whimbrel, common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E

5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} {{extensive}} grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 wigeon (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of pochard (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and <b>tufted</b> <b>duck</b> (Aythya fuligula). Signs of European otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches {{on the east side}} of the site are populated by palmate newts (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
25|$|Other {{wintering}} waterfowls are coot, cormorant, goldeneye, mallard, pochard, teal, and <b>tufted</b> <b>duck.</b> Other {{species that}} {{live on the}} lakes are the black-headed gull, little grebe, and mute swan.|$|E
25|$|The {{park has}} some 8,800 trees, {{including}} Ginkgo biloba, Cinnamomum camphora, Zelkova serrata, Formosan cherry, Somei-Yoshino cherry, and Japanese cherry. There {{is a further}} 24,800m2 of shrubs. Shinobazu Pond is a small lake with an area of 16 ha, extensive lotus beds, and marshland. It provides an important wintering ground for birds. Species commonly found include the <b>tufted</b> <b>duck,</b> Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, common pochard, little grebe, great egret, and great cormorant. The Baer's pochard, ring-necked duck, and American wigeon have also been recorded.|$|E

A recent and welcomed newcomer is the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus).|$|E
25|$|The {{valley of}} the Charente {{upstream}} from Angoulême is a Natura 2000 zone with remarkable species: 64 species of birds. Among them are species for marshland and wetland; and at Angoulême {{it is common to}} see diving and swimming birds, swans (mute swan), grebes (black-necked grebe, little grebe, horned grebe, great crested grebe), geese (greylag goose), ducks (gadwall, pintail, wigeon, shoveler), teal (garganey, teal) and scaup (pochard, <b>tufted</b> <b>duck)</b> on the Charente. It is more rare to see waders. Terns, gulls (laughing gull), great cormorants, return during periods of storms from far upstream on the river.|$|E
25|$|The campus lake is {{the largest}} plastic-bottomed lake in Europe. The {{decision}} by Sir Andrew Derbyshire and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall to give the university a lake had two motivations: one, to give the university a distinct image and identity while also creating areas to foster community; and two, more practically to create a drainage basin {{as the site of}} the Heslington West was built on generally flat agricultural land and it was feared the construction of the new buildings would increase the risk of flooding. The lake has attracted a large population of wild and semi-wild waterfowl, including greylag, Canada, barnacle and snow geese, coots, moorhens and large numbers of ducks, including mallards, <b>tufted</b> <b>duck,</b> and common pochards. There is also a growing population of black swans and a few great crested grebe. Herons have also been sighted on the lake. The southern end of the lake has been established as a bird sanctuary. Fishing is permitted in season, on purchase of a licence.|$|E

40|$|Wild {{birds have}} {{been implicated in}} the {{expansion}} of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) outbreaks across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa (in addition to traditional transmission by infected poultry, contaminated equipment, and people). Such a role would require wild birds to excrete virus {{in the absence of}} debilitating disease. By experimentally infecting wild ducks, we found that <b>tufted</b> <b>ducks,</b> Eurasian pochards, and mallards excreted signifi-cantly more virus than common teals, Eurasian wigeons, and gadwalls; yet only <b>tufted</b> <b>ducks</b> and, to a lesser degree, pochards became ill or died. These fi ndings suggest that some wild duck species, particularly mallards, can potentially be long-distance vectors of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) and that others, particularly <b>tufted</b> <b>ducks,</b> are more likely to act as sentinels...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In	 the	winter	of	 2010 – 2011,	 an	outbreak	of	highly	pathogenic	avian	 influenza	virus	 (HPAIV) 	 infection	occurred	 in	wild	and {{domestic}} {{birds in}} Japan. <b>Tufted</b> <b>ducks</b> were {{found dead in}} an urban area of Toyota City, Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture. Two <b>tufted</b> <b>ducks</b> were examined	histopathologically,	 immunohistochemically	and	molecularly.

2500|$|The lake's {{flora and}} fauna are rich, and include several endemic species. It {{features}} over 850 species of flora and over 180 species of vertebrates, including rare species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians. [...] The lake's surroundings are a mixture of meadows and high-altitude forests, especially birch, beech, pine and juniper (the former two indigenous, and the latter chiefly introduced by afforestation of the western shore). The indigenous trees downy birch and yellow beech (characteristic for its ever-yellow leaf color) stand out among the species of trees. Sundew is the only carnivorous plant in Serbia and is unique to the Vlasina region. Birdlife includes gray heron, <b>tufted</b> <b>duck</b> and cormorant. Mammalian species include wild boars, wolves and feral horses.|$|E
60|$|The skulls of {{the several}} breeds differ {{from each other and}} from the skull of the wild duck in very little except in the {{proportional}} length and curvature of the premaxillaries. These latter bones in the Call duck are short, and a line drawn from their extremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight, instead of being concave as in the common duck; so that the skull resembles that of a small goose. In the Hook-billed duck (figure 39), these same bones as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable manner, as represented. In the Labrador duck the premaxillaries are rather broader than in the wild duck; and in two skulls of this breed the vertical ridges {{on each side of the}} supra-occipital bone are very prominent. In the Penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter than in the wild duck; and the inferior points of the paramastoids more prominent. In a Dutch <b>tufted</b> <b>duck,</b> the skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more globular and was perforated by two large apertures; in this skull the lachrymal bones were produced much further backwards, so as to have a different shape and nearly to touch the post. lat. processes of the frontal bones, thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye. As the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in relation with so many other bones, I carefully compared them in all the principal breeds; but excepting in size they presented no difference.|$|E
50|$|The over-wintering birds include {{large numbers}} of mallard, teal, shoveler, pochard, <b>tufted</b> <b>duck</b> and pintail. Rarer species also visit such as smew and scaup. The lakes are used as a {{breeding}} area for <b>tufted</b> <b>duck,</b> mallard and great crested grebe.|$|E
