Although this property {{is not unique to}} the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E

It seems to have been related to earlier German buildings, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> also traces of Anglo-Norman and Lombard influences. Ribe, which followed with its great cathedral (1150–1250), had close trade contacts with the Rhine region of Germany. Both the materials, sandstone and tufa, and the models were taken from there.|$|E

Universities may also have a musicology department, and do research on many styles of music.|$|E
5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some specialised units. They used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and black pudding. In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E

Scout Leadership positions are often divided into 'uniform' and 'lay' positions.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the impala as {{a species}} of least concern overall. The black-faced impala, however, is {{classified}} as a vulnerable species; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. <b>Though</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no major threats {{to the survival of}} the common impala, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced impala. As of 2008, the population of the common impala has been estimated at around two million. According to some studies, translocation of the black-faced impala can be highly beneficial in its conservation.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} to the action RPG and hack and slash gameplay of the first Kingdom Hearts game, though developers made an effort to address some of the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a third-person camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Zouk's style of rhythmic music {{comes from the}} Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. <b>Though</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk emphasises star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and performances consist almost entirely of studio recordings.|$|E
