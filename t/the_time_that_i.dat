25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot}} of other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I give myself to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E

The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, [...] "In all of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spent with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote [...] "I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks to be you right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed that... I know {{that there are so many}} women who feel the same way".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the UNICEF charity record [...] was released; it is a {{collection}} of seventeen eclectic remixes of [...] "Army of Me". All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Live at Shepherds Bush Empire was released as a VHS in November, 1998, containing the last performance of the Post Tour, which took place at Shepherds Bush Empire in February 1997. Post Live, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post Tour, was included in the 2003 box set Live Box. The 2002 box set Family Tree includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. Post has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set Surrounded, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of Debut and Post together as one compilation [...] In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: [...] "I listened to [...] when we did the surround mixes of it like {{two or three years ago}} and I have to say I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well. I was very aware of it at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed to be musically promiscuous and have almost every song [...] different mood/style and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt {{it could be used}} as a foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{the band}} claimed that Bickers {{was taking a}} break due to exhaustion.

[...] at Chadwick while setting fire to the band's money in a protest against what he saw as the band's increasing commercialisation and materialism. Looking back on the incident two years later, Bickers confessed [...] "That was frustration. I just found at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't have the same aspirations {{as the rest of the}} band.

2500|$|However, some U.S. {{government}} officials have stated that the Israel lobby is not so powerful that they control U.S. foreign policy.

Ross, former U.S. ambassador and chief peace negotiator in the Middle East under Bill Clinton, who is now an official at WINEP, wrote: [...] "never in <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> led the American negotiations on the Middle East peace process did we take a step because 'the lobby' wanted us to.

In a letter to Israeli President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Schneerson wrote: [...] "From <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a child {{attending}} Cheder, and even before, the vision of the future Redemption began to take form in my imagination -- the Redemption of the Jewish people from their final Exile, a redemption of such magnitude and grandeur through which the purpose of the suffering, the harsh decrees, and annihilation of Exile will be understood." [...] Rabbi Schneerson also encouraged people to focus on Messiah very much. Beginning with his very first farbrengen as Rebbe, he spoke of this generation's mission to complete the Dira Betachtonim, and urged everyone to do all within their power to help the world reach its ultimate state of perfection, when Godliness and goodness will be naturally apparent and prevalent, with the final redemption.|$|E

[...] "So, since I had recorded the first record by myself, playing all the instruments, but I wanted people to think that it was a group, I figured that FOO FIGHTERS might lead people to believe that it was more than just one guy. Silly, huh?" [...] Continuing, Dave Grohl insisted that a more appropriate name could have been chosen.

Primarily a hip hop album, Drake attempted to incorporate R and pop to create a languid, grandiose sound.|$|E

[...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived."

It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not.
