5|$|Hurricane Humberto was a {{moderately}} powerful hurricane that briefly affected Bermuda in September 2001. It was the eighth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda, partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225km) west of Bermuda, which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27. There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane that produced a wealth of data on the structure of hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{from the}} laity took longer to surface. This {{resistance}} focused on two things: the King's right to demand military service, {{and his right}} to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, {{in his capacity as}} Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King; if the King intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony. In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament. While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax. As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of civil war. What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause. Edward signed the Confirmatio cartaruma confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forestand the nobility agreed to serve with the King on a campaign in Scotland.|$|E

In the {{meantime}} Zengi was assassinated and his territory was divided among his sons, one of whom, Nur ad-Din, emir of Aleppo, made an alliance with Damascus. When the European crusaders arrived, they and the nobles of Jerusalem agreed to attack Damascus. Their siege, however, was a complete failure. When the city seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of collapse, the crusader army suddenly moved against another section of the walls, and were driven back. By 1154, Damascus was firmly under Nur ad-Din's control.|$|E

The DuckTales episodes (and many European comics) show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th century, yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s. Despite this extremely advanced age, Scrooge does not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of dotage, and is vigorous enough {{to keep up with}} his nephews in adventures; with rare exception {{there appears to be no}} sign of him slowing down.|$|E

Gerakan, together with the Democratic Action Party (DAP) which took similar stances to Gerakan, were very successful in the 1969 general elections, and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of denying the Alliance the 2/3 Parliamentary majority required to amend the Constitution.

25|$|On 23 February, Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch's tallest hotel, was {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of collapse. The 26-storey building was displaced {{by half a}} metre in the quake and had dropped by 1 metre on one side; parts of the emergency stairwells collapsed. The building {{was thought to be}} irreparably damaged and have the potential to bring down other buildings if it fell; an area of a two-block radius around the hotel was thus evacuated. The building was eventually stabilised and, on 4 March it was decided the building would be demolished over the following six months, so that further work could be done with the buildings nearby. Demolition was completed in May 2012. The 21-storey PricewaterhouseCoopers building, the city's tallest office tower, is among the office buildings to be demolished.|$|E

While both Texas and Arkansas appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of establishing nationally competitive programs with the hires of Abe Lemons and Eddie Sutton, respectively, only Arkansas managed to achieve sustained success in the following years, winning at least 20 games in 13 seasons from 1977 to 1991, with Sutton (1974–85) and Nolan Richardson (1985–2002) each reaching a Final Four and an Elite Eight. (Richardson would lead the Razorbacks to two more Final Fours and a national championship after Arkansas' departure from the SWC.) Arkansas dominated the series over this final phase of the SWC rivalry, winning 27 out of 37 games played during this period.|$|E

Masséna sent 12 battalions charging up the main road while a small force tried a right hook around the flank of the entrenchments. The flanking force made headway before being stalled. Jellacic made economical use of his outnumbered force. Masséna's main assault in front failed and was sent on its way by a final counterattack by Jellacic's men.

25|$|Bercow's {{election}} as Speaker was controversial {{because he is}} believed to have had the support of very few MPs from his former party. Conservative MPs generally viewed Bercow with distrust because of his changing political views (having moved over the years from being very right-wing to become more socially liberal, leading to clashes with past party leaders), his acceptance of an advisory role from the Labour government (a party he had often been rumoured <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> of joining), his general lack of good relations with fellow MPs from the Conservatives, and his vigorous campaigning for the Speaker's job. It has been speculated that he received the votes of as few as three of his fellow Conservative MPs. However, he received the votes {{of a large number of}} Labour MPs, many of whom were angered at the way they perceived Michael Martin to have been hounded out of the job and wanted his replacement to be someone who was not a favourite of the Conservative Party.|$|E
