5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
25|$|Coffee {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Paris in about 1660, and came from Martinique and the IÎe de Bourbon, now Réunion. The English blockade of French ports cut off the supply, and Parisians were forced to drink substitutes made from the chicory or acorns. The blockade also cut off the supplies of chocolate, tea and sugar. Napoleon encouraged the growing of sugar beets to replace cane sugar, and in February 1812 he went himself <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> products of the first sugar beet refineries opened just outside the city, at Passy and Chaillot.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the plant}} family Cucurbitacea, which {{includes}} zucchini/marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are chemically classified as steroids; they defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can {{have high levels of}} cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae—any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Also, dry weather conditions/irregular watering can stress the plant and favor the production of the toxin. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly among the elderly) should therefore ask a younger person <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> zucchini for them.|$|E

500|$|Whales are {{not thought}} {{to have a good}} sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. [...] However, some toothed whales have {{preferences}} between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment <b>to</b> <b>taste.</b> <b>The</b> presence of the Jacobson's organ indicates that whales can smell food once inside their mouth, which might be similar to the sensation of taste.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} well {{received}} and was praised by reviewers for its clarity. [...] The Literary Gazette, for instance, {{thought that it}} [...] "teaches us {{the elements of the}} entire circle of natural philosophy in the clearest and most perspicuous manner".

500|$|According to {{one version}} of the story, while {{traversing}} the countryside, Radama and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally fat that the king {{decided to make a}} burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called fandroana that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat. [...] The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with {{the first day of the}} year. To this end, the holiday symbolically represented a community-wide renewal that would take place over a period of several days before and after the first of the year.|$|E

500|$|Early {{reviews of}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] focused {{on it as}} part of Keats's {{collection}} of poems Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. An anonymous critic in the July 1820 Monthly Review claimed, [...] "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember. [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." [...] Josiah Conder in the September 1820 Eclectic Review mentioned, [...] "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." [...] An anonymous reviewer in The Edinburgh Magazine for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that [...] "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Beatles, in {{recording}} [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] {{from the}} album Sgt.

John had said {{that he wanted to}} 'smell the sawdust on the floor,' wanted <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of the circus. [...] I said to him, 'What we need is a calliope.' 'A what?' 'Steam whistles, played by a keyboard.'" [...] Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing Sousa marches. [...] " [...] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had Geoff Emerick throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random." ...|$|E
2500|$|A notable recent version, which {{reverts to}} the Syrian recension, is a {{critical}} edition based on the 14th or 15th-century Syrian manuscript in the Bibliothèque Nationale, originally used by Galland. This version, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by Muhsin Mahdi (1984) and rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a [...] "definitive" [...] coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the Mamluk period (a view that remains contentious). Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of [...] "the only real Arabian Nights" [...] recognize it as being the best source on the original style and linguistic form of the mediaeval work and praise the Haddawy translation as [...] "very readable" [...] and [...] "strongly recommended for anyone who wishes <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>the</b> authentic flavour of those tales". An additional second volume of Arabian nights translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales not present in the Leiden edition, was published in 1995.|$|E
