5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres {{may be associated with}} hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. <b>The</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E

5|$|A {{classification}} of hepatic encephalopathy was introduced at the World Congress of Gastroenterology 1998 in Vienna. According to this classification, hepatic encephalopathy is subdivided in type A, B and C depending on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of hypopituitarism vary, depending on which hormones are undersecreted and on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the abnormality. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other investigations are needed to find <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. Hypopituitarism is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E
5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} {{often have}} no or only mild symptoms. Numerous symptoms and signs {{are associated with}} hypothyroidism, and {{can be related to}} <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause,</b> or a direct effect of having not enough thyroid hormones. Hashimoto's thyroiditis may present with the mass effect of a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).|$|E

5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the lungs can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> is identified and treated.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment {{in patients with}} traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to {{the intensive care unit}} is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E

5|$|Vaccines {{to prevent}} {{certain types of}} {{pneumonia}} are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b> Pneumonia believed {{to be due to}} bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also {{increases the risk}} of arterial thrombosis (which is <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, resulting from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. <b>The</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> of the condition is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E
