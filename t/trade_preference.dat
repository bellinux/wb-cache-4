6000|$|Now I must trench for {{one moment}} upon the {{economic}} aspect. What does preference mean? It can only mean one thing. It can only mean better prices. It can only mean better prices for Colonial goods. I assert, without reserve, that preference can only operate {{through the agency of}} price. All that we are told about improving and developing the cultivation of tobacco in South Africa, and calling great new areas for wheat cultivation into existence in Australia, depends upon the stimulation of the production of those commodities, through securing to the producers larger opportunities for profit. I say that unless preference means better prices it will be ineffective in achieving the objects for the sake of which it is urged. But the operation of preference consists, so far as we are concerned, in putting a penal tax upon foreign goods, and the object of putting that penal tax on foreign goods is to enable the Colonial supply to {{rise to the level of}} the foreign goods plus the tax, and by so conferring upon the Colonial producer a greater reward, to stimulate him more abundantly to cater for the supply of this particular market. I say, therefore, without hesitation, that the only manner in which a <b>trade</b> <b>preference</b> can operate is through the agency of price. If preference does not mean better prices it seems to me a great fraud on those who are asked to make sacrifices to obtain it; and by [...] "better" [...] prices I mean higher prices--that is to say, higher prices than the goods are worth, if sold freely in the markets of the world.|$|E

40|$|The July Package of WTO {{agricultural}} {{trade negotiations}} {{and the recent}} Hong Kong WTO Ministerial declaration call for duty and quota-free access for imports originated from least developed countries, including the African LDCs (ALDCs). This paper discusses the merits of this proposal. The usefulness of preferences has been revealed by the high utilization rate of agricultural <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> and the case for improving <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> {{is supported by the}} possibility of preference erosions. Based on these, this paper interprets the July Package text as deepening, widening, broadening and strengthening <b>trade</b> <b>preferences.</b> A set of CGE simulations illustrates the potential impact of implementing this proposal. The first scenario confirms the ALDCs' vulnerability in multilateral liberalization. Deepening and widening <b>trade</b> <b>preferences</b> (scenario 2) would more than offset these negative effects. At the same time, harmonizing the preferences programs would help reveal true comparative advantages of the ALDCs. Adding selected advanced developing countries to the preference-granting group (i. e., broadening preferences) would further expand exports from the ALDCs. It {{should be noted that the}} added benefits from broadening preferences would be smaller than what could be achieved from the deepening and widening scenario. However, these estimated benefits would not be fully realized without strengthening the legal foundation of the preference programs and the ALDCs need to conduct domestic policies reforms aiming at creating an enabling environment for their exportoriented industry to take advantage of this opportunity.

In return for their efforts towards eradication of the coca plant, the countries were granted U.S. tariff exemptions on certain products, such as certain types of fruit. Peru ceased complying with the ATPA in 2012, and lost all tariff exemptions previously granted by the United States through the ATPA.

Yet as events proved, it was the budget that would sow dissension, override other legislative concerns and signal a new political movement. Charles Thomson Ritchie's remission of the shilling import-duty on corn led to Joseph Chamberlain's crusade in favour of tariff reform. These were taxes on imported goods with <b>trade</b> <b>preference</b> given to the Empire, to protect British industry from competition, strengthen the Empire {{in the face of}} growing German and American economic power, and provide revenue, other than raising taxes, for the social welfare legislation.

Tariff reform was popular with Unionist supporters, but the threat of higher prices for food imports made the policy an electoral albatross.
