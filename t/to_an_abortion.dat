25|$|Abortion {{is illegal}} in Brazil {{except for the}} case of rape or when the mother's life is in danger. Though abortions are against the law, it is {{estimated}} that over one million abortions are performed in Brazil each year, though data on abortion incidence is not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women are treated for abortion complications each year in Brazilian hospitals. The punishment for a woman performing an abortion on herself or consenting <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abortion</b> is one to three years of imprisonment. The punishment for those performing abortions is one to four years of imprisonment, and this number increases by one-third if harm is caused to the women or one-half if the abortion leads to the death of the woman.|$|E

During the convention, the party's founder, Howard Phillips, gave a controversial speech in which he referred to Keyes as [...] "the Neocon candidate" [...] who [...] "lingered in the Republican Party until a week ago."

During an exchange with California Representative Duncan Hunter, Gilmore expressed the responsibility to capture Osama bin Laden and to fight terrorism with the help from allies and to use diplomacy to end the [...] "sea of hostility" [...] that he believed existed from [...] "Morocco, {{all the way through}} the Middle East, [...] all the way to the Philippines." [...] Later in the debate, he announced his disagreement with a possible constitutional amendment to give naturalized citizens such as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the ability to run for president. On abortion, Gilmore confirmed his support for a woman's right <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abortion</b> in the first eight to twelve weeks of pregnancy, but commented that he operated as a pro-life governor. He affirmed his opposition to stem-cell research. At the end of the debate, Gilmore asserted his attributes as a [...] "consistent Conservative" [...] while surprising many when he stated that he would not pardon Scooter Libby. He established his opposition to a National Identification Card, and highlighted the need to be [...] "vigorous on the war on terror", focus on homeland security, and become energy independent in the next presidency.|$|E

In his opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist questioned the fundamental right <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abortion,</b> the [...] "right to privacy," [...] and the strict scrutiny application in Roe.

Opponents of abortion feared that this ruling could only be enforced {{in a way that would}} lead to an expansive abortion regime of the kind found in many other countries. There were two failed amendments that would have excluded suicide as grounds for abortion, the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 and the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 made provisions for the finding of the court in the X Case, allowing abortion where the life of the woman was at risk, including a risk of suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Planned Parenthood v. Casey, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the constitutionality of several Pennsylvania state statutory provisions regarding abortion was challenged. [...] The Court's plurality opinion reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade stating that [...] "matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment." [...] The Court's plurality opinion upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion while altering the standard for analyzing restrictions on that right, crafting the [...] "undue burden" [...] standard for abortion restrictions. Planned Parenthood v. Casey differs from Roe, however, because under Roe the state could not regulate abortions in the first trimester whereas under Planned Parenthood v. Casey the state can regulate abortions in the first trimester, or any point before the point of viability, and beyond as long as that regulation does not pose an undue burden on women's fundamental right <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abortion.</b> Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four regulations and invalidated the requirement of spousal notification.|$|E
2500|$|Antony Beevor {{estimates}} {{that up to}} half of all rape victims were victims of gang rapes. Naimark states that not only did each victim have to carry the trauma with her {{for the rest of her}} days, it also inflicted a massive collective trauma on the East German nation. Naimark concludes [...] "The social psychology of women and men in the Soviet zone of occupation was marked by the crime of rape from the first days of the occupation, through the founding of the GDR in the fall of 1949, until, one could argue, the present." [...] German women who became pregnant after being raped by Soviet soldiers in World War II were invariably denied the right <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>abortion</b> so they [...] would be further humiliated [...] by being forced to carry an unwanted child. According to the book Berlin: The Downfall, 1945 by Antony Beevor, some 90% of raped Berlin women in 1945 contracted venereal diseases as the result of these consequential rapes and 3.7% of all children born in Germany from 1945 to 1946 had Soviet fathers. The history of this particular aspect of the mass-rape of German women by Soviet troops was considered a taboo subject until 1992.|$|E
