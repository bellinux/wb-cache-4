5|$|At only 5,000 {{years of}} age, the Everglades {{is a young}} region in {{geological}} terms.

5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. <b>The</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{first four}} Saturn I test flights were {{launched}} from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight {{with a live}} S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified {{the safety of the}} translunar environment by measuring <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> severity of micrometeorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E
5|$|From 1 July 1965, Oslo Sporveier {{took over}} the {{operation}} of the Ekeberg Line, which was numbered Line 16. Oslo Sporveier took over all employees and rolling stock, but Ekebergbanen remained a holding and real estate company. Immediately following the take-over, Oslo Sporveier introduced a 20-minute headway and suggested that the line be closed and replaced by buses from 29 October 1967, when the Østensjø Line of the metro opened. Following the closing of Sagene Ring, there were increased protests against closing the tramway. Traffic had decreased on the Ekeberg Line, but proponents for keeping it stated that this was because Oslo Sporveier had reduced <b>the</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> moved the end station out of the core of the city center. When the proposal to close the Ekeberg Line was considered by the city council, it was decided that only the Simenbråten Line was to be closed.|$|E

5|$|Weather systems {{affecting}} Newfoundland usually {{originate from}} the west, over mainland Canada, {{or from the}} southwest, from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Cyclonic storms consist of an area of low atmospheric pressure characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping in off the open North Atlantic Ocean. These storms are sometimes referred to as Nor'easters and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds sweeping over a large surface of ocean can build up very large waves. <b>The</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. <b>The</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>and</b> voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E

Antibodies to CSP and LSA- 1 were primarily members of the IgG 1 and IgG 3 subclasses, while antibodies to TRAP were primarily members of the IgG 3 and IgG 4 subclasses. In a treatment-reinfection study following dry season testing, antibodies to TRAP were associated with a trend toward protection from infection in children (P = 0. 051) but not in adults. Antibodies to LSA- 1 and CSP did not correlate with protection in children or adults.
