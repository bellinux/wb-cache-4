40|$|This report {{describes}} the inactivation of lipid-containing viruses by several long-chain alcohols. A striking peak in antiviral activity {{was found for}} saturated alcohols having chain lengths from 10 to 14 carbons. Viruses having different membrane structure showed different susceptibilities to alcohols having different chain lengths and structural features. Decanol, dodecanol, and <b>tetradecanol</b> readily inactivated herpes simplex virus and the enveloped bacterial virus φ 6. The lipid-containing virus PM 2 was susceptible to decanol and dodecanol but comparatively unsusceptible to <b>tetradecanol.</b> The branched-chain alcohol phytol, a naturally occurring component of chlorophyll, was active against φ 6 and herpes simplex virus but not against PM 2. Polyoma virus and the bacteriophage φ 23 - 1 -a, which do not contain lipids, were not susceptible to inactivation {{by any of the}} alcohols tested. Experiments were also carried out {{to determine the effects of}} these compounds on cells. At 0. 5 mM, decanol lysed human embryonic lung cells, erythrocytes, and the bacterial hosts for φ 6 and PM 2. Dodecanol, <b>tetradecanol,</b> and phytol at this concentration were less damaging to cells. At 0. 05 mM, none of the alcohols caused observable cytopathic effects on human embryonic lung cells, although several of the alcohols at this concentration were active against herpes simplex virus. Our findings suggest that dodecanol, <b>tetradecanol,</b> and phytol may warrant further studies as potential antiviral agents, particularly for topical application to virus-infected areas of the skin...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of cholesterol on the bilayer loading of drugs and their subsequent release and to investigate fatty alcohols as an alternative bilayer stabiliser to cholesterol. Methods The loading and release rates of four low solubility drugs (diazepam, ibuprofen, midazolam and propofol) incorporated within the bilayer of multilamellar liposomes which contained a range of cholesterol (0 – 33 mol/mol%) or a fatty alcohol (<b>tetradecanol,</b> hexadecanol and octadecanol) were investigated. The molecular packing of these various systems was also investigated in Langmuir monolayer studies. Key findings Loading and release of drugs within the liposome bilayer was shown to be influenced by their cholesterol content: increasing cholesterol content was shown to reduce drug incorporation and inclusion of cholesterol in the bilayer changed the release profile of propofol from zero-order, for phosphatidyl choline only liposomes, to a first-order model when 11 to 33 total molar % of cholesterol was present in the formulation. At higher bilayer concentrations substitution of cholesterol with <b>tetradecanol</b> was shown to have less of a detrimental impact on bilayer drug loading. However, the presence of cholesterol within the liposome bilayer was shown to reduce drug release compared with fatty alcohols. Monolayer studies undertaken showed that effective mean area per molecule for a 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DSPC) : cholesterol mixture deviated by 9 % from the predicted area compared with 5 % with a similar DSPC : <b>tetradecanol</b> mixture. This evidence, combined with cholesterol being a much more bulky structure, indicated that the condensing influence of <b>tetradecanol</b> was less compared with cholesterol, thus supporting the reduced impact of <b>tetradecanol</b> on drug loading and drug retention. Conclusions Liposomes can be effectively formulated using fatty alcohols as an alternative bilayer stabiliser to cholesterol. The general similarities in the characteristics of liposomes containing fatty alcohols or cholesterol suggest a common behavioural influence for both compounds within the bilayer...|$|E

40|$|While many {{theories}} of general anesthesia postulate a lipid site of action, {{there has been}} no adequate explanation for the lack of anesthetic potency of the highly hydrophobic primary alkanols with more than 12 carbons (the cut-off). Some work suggests that these nonanesthetic alcohols do not dissolve in membranes. Other work contradicts this and suggests that an anesthetic site on a protein provides a better explanation. Here we show that both the anesthetic dodecanol and the nonanesthetic <b>tetradecanol</b> are taken up equally well into the tissues of animals and into isolated postsynaptic membranes. When a group of Rana pipiens tadpoles were treated with dodecanol, half were anesthetized by 4. 7 microM (free aqueos concentration), and the corresponding concentration in the tissues was found to be 0. 4 mmol per kg wet weight. Prolonged exposure (92 hr) to <b>tetradecanol</b> produced even higher tissue concentrations (0. 7 mmol per kg wet weight), yet no anesthetic effects were observed. Furthermore, general anesthetics are thought to act on postsynaptic membranes but both alkanols partitioned into postsynaptic membranes from Torpedo electroplaques. The spin label, 12 -doxyl stearate, was incorporated into these membranes. The lipid order parameter it reported was decreased by the anesthetic alcohols (octanol, decanol, and dodecanol), whereas the nonanesthetic alcohols either did not change it significantly (<b>tetradecanol)</b> or actually increased it (hexadecanol and octadecanol). Thus, although lipid solubility is unable to account for the pharmacology of the cut-off in potency of the long-chain alcohols, lipid perturbations provide an accurate description...|$|E

40|$|The {{observations}} reported herein {{confirm that}} the bright spots in high-resolution STM images of adsorbed alkanes and alkanols are predominantly due to the electronic and topographic structure of the molecule, and not predominantly due to the substrate.

40|$|This {{research}} primarily {{focused on}} identifying the formulation parameters which control {{the efficacy of}} liposomes as delivery systems to enhance the delivery of poorly soluble drugs. Preliminary studies focused on the drug loading of ibuprofen within vesicle systems. Initially both liposomal and niosomal formulations were screened for their drug-loading capacity: liposomal systems were shown to offer significantly higher ibuprofen loading and thereafter lipid based systems were further investigated. Given the key role cholesterol is known to play within the stability of bilayer vesicles. the optimum cholesterol content in terms of drug loading and release of poorly soluble drugs was then investigated. From these studies a concentration of 11 total molar % of cholesterol {{was used as a}} benchmark for all further formulations. Investigating the effect of liposomc composition on several low solubility drugs, drug loading was shown to be enhanced by adopting longer chain length lipids. cationic lipids and. decreasing drug molecular weight. Drug release was increased by using cationic lipids and lower molecular weight of drug; conversely, a reduction was noted when employing longer chain lipids thus supporting the rational of longer chain lipids producing more stable liposomes, a theory also supported by results obtained via Langmuir studies· although it was revealed that stability is also dependent on geometric features associated with the lipid chain moiety. Interestingly, reduction in drug loading appeared to be induced when symmetrical phospholipids were substituted for lipids constituting asymmetrical alkyl chain groups thus further highlighting the importance of lipid geometry. Combining a symmetrical lipid with an asymmetrical derivative enhanced encapsulation of a hydrophobic drug while reducing that of another suggesting the importance of drug characteristics. Phosphatidylcholine liposornes could successfully be prepared (and visualised using transmission electron microscopy) from fatty alcohols therefore offering an alternative liposomal stabiliser to cholesterol. Results obtained revealed that liposomes containing <b>tetradecanol</b> within their formulation shares similar vesicle size, drug encapsulation, surface charge. and toxicity profiles as liposomes formulated with cholesterol, however the <b>tetradecanol</b> preparation appeared to release considerably more drug during stability studies. Langmuir monolayer studies revealed that the condensing influence by <b>tetradecanol</b> is less than compared with cholesterol suggesting that this reduced intercalation by the former could explain why the <b>tetradecanol</b> formulation released more drug compared with cholesterol formulations. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) was used to analyse the morphology and stability of liposomes. These investigations indicated that the presence of drugs within the liposomal bilayer were able to enhance the stability of the bilayers against collapse under reduced hydration conditions. In addition the presence of charged lipids within the formulation under reduced hydration conditions compared with its neutral counterpart. However the applicability of using ESEM as a new method to investigate liposome stability appears less valid than first hoped since the results are often open to varied interpretation and do not provide a robust set of data to support conclusions in some cases...|$|E

Applied potential 3. 0 kv. lic acid C 20 hydrogen bonded dimmers form and in paraffin as there is no hydrogen bonding. As the polarization is so little affected by differing structure and crystall ine state it is improbable that uniform volume polarization is involved. All dielec-trics used in electret studies have a finite electrical conductivity. In any dielectric with a finite electrical conductivity space charges will accumulate near the electrodes applied to the surface if there is any hindrance to the complete discharge of the charge carriers at the electrode. It is impossible to attach removable electrodes to a solid dielectric {{in such a way that}} there is perfect electrical contact over the whole dielectric-electrode interface and, if the surface charge or dipole moment is to be measured, and hence a volume polarization detected, the electrodes must be removable. Therefore in any electret study space charges must accumulate; and in fact whenever they have been directly sought by probe techniques, as in this work and in <b>tetradecanol</b> by Cross and Hart (2) or in carnauba wax [Gemant (7), Antennan (8), Van der Linde (9) ], they have been detected.

We propose that liquid general anesthetics provide an experimental tool for lowering critical temperatures in plasma membranes of intact cells, which we predict will reduce lipid-mediated heterogeneity {{in a way that is}} complimentary to increasing or decreasing cholesterol. Also, several possible implications of our results are discussed in the context of current models of anesthetic action on ligand-gated ion channels...|$|E

A composite PCM has been fabricated by the binary eutectic mixture of <b>tetradecanol</b> (TD) and lauric acid (LA) absorbed into the expanded perlite (EP) using vacuum impregnation method, and its thermal conductivity was promoted by aluminium powder (AP) additive. Besides, the styrene-acrylic emulsion has been mixed with the composite PCM particles to form the protective film, so as {{to solve the problem}} of leakage. Thus, a novel PCM panel (PCMP) has been prepared using compression moulding forming method. The thermal property, microstructure characteristic, mechanical property, thermal conductivity, thermal reliability and leakage of the composite PCM have been investigated and analysed. Meanwhile, the thermal performance of the prepared PCMP was tested through PCMPs installed on the inside wall of a cell under outdoor climatic conditions. The composite PCM has a melting temperature of 24. 9 °C, a freezing temperature of 25. 2 °C, a melting latent heat of 78. 2 J/g and a freezing latent heat of 81. 3 J/g. The thermal conductivity test exposed that the thermal conductivity has been enhanced with the addition of AP and the latent heat has been decreased, but it still remains in a high level. The leakage test result has proven that liquid PCM leaking has been avoided by the surface film method. The thermal performance experiment has shown the significant function of PCMP about adjusting the indoor temperature and reducing the heats transferring between the wall inside and outside. In view of the thermal performance, mechanical property and thermal reliability results, it can be concluded that the prepared PCMP has a promising building application potential...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} a novel low {{temperature}} synthesis approach of CdS nanocrystals is described starting from well known precursors, Cd(SA) and TOP-S, in a ligand system of aliphatic long chain alcohols. A one-pot synthesis approach is applied using a laboratory microwave heating source. The resulting CdS nanocrystals exhibit an absorbance with a pronounced fine-structure, a photoluminescence {{with a very}} high ratio between the band gap peak and the defect peak and a fluorescence quantum yield of 33 %. Different synthesis approaches have been investigated by changing heating rate, temperature, precursor concentration and chain length of the aliphatic alcohol ligand as well as chain length of the Cadmium precursor. It was found that small changes in the heating rate do not affect the reaction. Changing the reaction temperature between 200 °C and 160 °C has no visible effects {{on the quality of}} the resulting CdS nanocrystals. At 140 °C the nanoparticles experience a significant drop in quality, probably because there is a major change in the growth mechanism of the nanocrystals at that low temperature. At 100 °C and 120 °C the creation of so-called CdS nanoclusters is observed, and a growth mechanism towards nanocrystals based on cluster aggregation is suggested. For the synthesis of high quality nanoparticles it was found that a ratio of 1 : 25 between precursor and aliphatic alcohol is preferable as well as a ratio of 1 : 1 between the two precursors. If the chain length of both the precursors and the alcohol is short, the reaction rate is enhanced. If the chain length is too short the nanocrystals grow very fast and the size distribution gets broad, the photoluminescence intensity decreases and the ratio between band gap luminescence and defect luminescence decreases. The best Cd-precursor was found to be Cd-Laurate and the most suitable ligand evaluated was <b>Tetradecanol...</b>|$|E

40|$|A dense {{population}} of the phototrophic consortium “Pelochromatium roseum” was investigated in the chemocline of a temperate holomictic lake (Lake Dagow, Brandenburg, Germany). Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the brown epibionts of “P. roseum” constituted up to 37 % of the total bacterial cell number and up to 88 % of all green sulfur bacteria present in the chemocline. Specific amplification of 16 S rRNA gene fragments of green sulfur bacteria and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} fingerprinting yielded a maximum of four different DNA bands depending on the year of study, indicating that the diversity of green sulfur bacteria was low. The 465 -bp 16 S rRNA gene sequence of the epibiont of “P. roseum” was obtained after sorting of individual consortia by micromanipulation, followed by a highly sensitive PCR. The sequence obtained represents a new phylotype within the radiation of green sulfur bacteria. Maximum light-dependent H 14 CO 3 − fixation in the chemocline in the presence of 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea suggested that there was anaerobic autotrophic growth of the green sulfur bacteria. The metabolism of the epibionts was further studied by determining stable carbon isotope ratios (δ 13 C) of their specific biomarkers. Analysis of photosynthetic pigments by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of high concentrations of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) e and smaller amounts of BChl a and d and chlorophyll a in the chemocline. Unexpectedly, isorenieratene and β-isorenieratene, carotenoids typical of other brown members of the green sulfur bacteria, were absent. Instead, four different esterifying alcohols of BChl e were isolated as biomarkers of green sulfur bacterial epibionts, and their δ 13 C values were determined. Farnesol, <b>tetradecanol,</b> hexadecanol, and hexadecenol all were significantly enriched in 13 C compared to bulk dissolved and particulate organic carbon and compared to the biomarkers of purple sulfur bacteria. The difference between the δ 13 C values of farnesol, the major esterifying alcohol of BChl e, and CO 2 was − 7. 1 %, which provides clear evidence that the mode of growth of the green sulfur bacterial epibionts of “P. roseum” in situ is photoautotrophic...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals is explored through several interrelated analytical investigations. After {{a brief discussion}} of the nanocrystal history and applications, molecular orbital theory is {{used to describe the}} electronic properties of semiconductors, and how these materials behave on the nanoscale. Quantum confinement {{plays a major role in}} dictating the optical properties of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals, however surface states also have an equally significant contribution to the electronic properties of nanocrystals due to the high surface area to volume ratio of nanoscale semiconductors. Controlling {{surface chemistry}} is essential to functionalizing these materials for biological imaging and photovoltaic device applications. To better understand the surface chemistry of semiconducting nanocrystals, three competing surface chemistry models are presented: 1.) The TOPO model, 2.) the Non-stoichiometric model, and 3.) the Neutral Fragment model. Both the non-stoichiometric and neutral fragment models accurately describe the behavior of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. These models rely on the covalent bond classification system, which divides ligands into three classes: 1.) X-type, 1 -electron donating ligands that balance charge with excess metal at the nanocrystal surface, 2.) L-type, 2 -electron donors that bind metal sites, and 3.) Z-type, 2 -electron acceptors that bind chalcogenide sites. Each of these ligand classes is explored in detail to better understand the surface chemistry of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. First, chloride-terminated, tri-n-butylphosphine (Bu 3 P) bound CdSe nanocrystals were prepared by cleaving carboxylate ligands from CdSe nanocrystals with chlorotrimethylsilane in Bu 3 P solution. 1 H and 31 P{ 1 H} nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the isolated nanocrystals allowed assignment of distinct signals from several free and bound species, including surface-bound Bu 3 P and [Bu 3 P-H]+[Cl]- ligands as well as a Bu 3 P complex of cadmium chloride. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy supports complete cleavage of the X-type carboxylate ligands. Combined with measurements of the Se:Cd:Cl ratio using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, these studies support a structural model of nanocrystals where chloride ligands terminate the crystal lattice by balancing the charges of excess Cd 2 + ions. The adsorption of dative phosphine ligands leads to nanocrystals who's solubility is afforded by reversibly bound and readily exchanged L-type ligands, e. g. primary amines and phosphines. The other halides (Br and I) can also be used to prepare Bu 3 P-bound, halide-terminated CdSe nanocrystals, however these nanocrystals are not soluble after exchange. The change in binding affinity of Bu 3 P over the halide series is briefly discussed. Next, we report a series of L-type ligand exchanges using Bu 3 P-bound, chloride-terminated CdSe nanocrystals with several Lewis bases, including aromatic, cyclic, and non-cyclic sulfides, and ethers; primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and phosphines; tertiary phosphine chalcogenides; primary alcohols, isocyanides, and isothiocyanides. Using 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we establish a relative binding affinity for these ligands that reflects electronic considerations but is dominated primarily by steric interactions, as determined by comparing binding affinity to Tolmann cone angles. We also used chloride-terminated CdSe nanocrystals to explore the reactivity of ionic salts at nanocrystal surfaces. These salts, particularly [Bu 3 P-H]+[Cl]-, bind nanocrystals surfaces as L-type ligands, making them soluble in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. This information should provide insight for rational ligand design for future applications involving metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. The strongest ligand, primary n-alkylamine, rapidly displace the Bu 3 P from halide-terminated CdSe nanocrystals, leading to amine-bound nanocrystals with higher dative ligand coverages and greatly increased photoluminescence quantum yields. The importance of ligand coverage to both the UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence spectra are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that metal carboxylate complexes (L-M(O 2 CR) 2, R = oleyl, tetradecyl, M = Cd, Pb) are readily displaced from carboxylate-terminated ME nanocrystals (ME = CdSe, CdS, PbSe, PbS) by various Lewis bases (L = tri-n-butylamine, tetrahydrofuran, <b>tetradecanol,</b> N,N-dimethyl-n-butylamine, tri-n-butylphosphine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylbutylene- 1, 4 -diamine, pyridine, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene- 1, 2 -diamine, n-octylamine). The relative displacement potency is measured by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and depends most strongly on geometric factors like sterics and chelation, though also on the hard/soft match with the cadmium ion. The results suggest that ligands displace L-M(O 2 CR) 2 by cooperatively complexing the displaced metal ion as well as the nanocrystal. Removal of surface-bound Cd(O 2 CR) 2 from CdSe and CdS nanocrystals decreases their photoluminescence quantum yield and decreases the apparent intensity of the 1 Se- 2 S 3 / 2 h absorption without changing the position of the first electronic transition or the nanocrystal size. These changes are partially reversed upon rebinding of M(O 2 CR) 2 at room temperature (~ 60 %) and fully reversed at elevated temperature. These results indicate that reproducible optical properties and ligand exchange reactivity may be achieved if the surface monolayer of excess metal ions is carefully controlled. In fact, using well-purified nanocrystals samples free from acidic impurities that may form L-type ionic salts on reaction with primary amines, we have synthesized the first fully stoichiometric CdSe nanocrystals though L-type promoted Z-type displacement. These amine-bound nanocrystals perform well in thin-film transistors and can be used as a synthon for Z-type addition reactions. These studies together inform a coherent picture of metal chalcogenide nanocrystal surface chemistry. In particular, they reinforce the neutral fragment model as a viable pedagogical tool for training new inorganic materials chemists. We also discuss the connection between surface chemistry and the optical properties of CdSe nanocrystals. Both L-type and Z-type ligands are required to fully passivate these materials. Most importantly, managing nanocrystal composition and optioelectronic properties demands careful analytical techniques. While nanocrystals are not simple molecules, they can be manipulated through rational design informed by accurate models. The work described here establishes a deeper understanding of nanocrystal surface chemistry and provides an example for future studies designed to explore the fundamental physics of these materials and functionalize metal chalcogenide nanocrystals for real-world applications...|$|E
