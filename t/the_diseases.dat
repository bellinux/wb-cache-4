5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. <b>The</b> <b>diseases</b> appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> can {{be managed}} by {{controlling}} the vector and thus reducing the incidence of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> by disrupting <b>the</b> transmission cycle.

40|$|Scientists {{have made}} new discoveries about a strange {{low-level}} <b>disease.</b> <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> is {{highly correlated with}} a particularly gene. 25 % {{of the population has}} this gene. 90 % of those with the gene develop <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Among <b>the</b> 75 % majority, on the other hand, only 10 % develop <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> There is also a mysterious skin rash which can only occur in people who have <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Among <b>the</b> people who have the gene and develop <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> 90 % show the rash.

50|$|Suppose {{a disease}} has a {{prevalence}} of 1/1000. A test for <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> has a true positive rate of 100% — it never misses {{someone who has}} <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> It also has a false positive rate of 5%. A patient takes the test {{and the result is}} positive. How likely is it that he has <b>the</b> <b>disease?</b> To find this out, we need to know what percent of people who tested positive have <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Suppose 1000 people are tested for <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Since <b>the</b> prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> is 1/1000, we know that, on average, 1 person in that group of 1000 will have <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> That person will test positive (100% true positive rate). We also know that 999 people, on average, don’t have <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> and that 5% of them will test positive (false positives). That’s 999x.05, or approximately 50 people. That means that 51 people will test positive (1 true positive and 50 false positives), and only one of those people will actually have <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Therefore, 1/51, or about 2% of the people who tested positive actually have <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> So, <b>the</b> patient's chance of having <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> is about 2%.|$|R
5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza. These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had {{a major impact on}} Maya populations. The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Haynes and Leary {{published}} the magazine Strange V.D., which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous explanations for <b>the</b> <b>diseases.</b> After being caught {{with one of}} these pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E
5|$|Mackinnon {{published}} over 40 academic papers, {{primarily on}} parasitic species of protozoa (especially flagellates and sporozoa). She {{had a reputation}} for her skill as a lecturer, which stemmed from her time at University College, Dundee. Mackinnon gave broadcast talks for schools and numerous lectures, with a reputation that she never repeated a lecture in 30 years of teaching. These included lectures on <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> spread by flies, and how good hygiene and the prevention of flies breeding could stop typhoid. She also set up a research centre in protozoology, the only non-medical protozoological research centre in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. <b>The</b> <b>diseases</b> caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E

5|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, {{such as in}} Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India, and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro. Microbiology, {{the scientific study of}} microorganisms, began with their observation under the microscope in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax.|$|E
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow sigatoka derives {{its name}} from the Sigatoka valley in Fiji. This was where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> was first {{documented}} in 1912.

5|$|Janet {{made its}} final {{landfall}} in the Mexican state of Veracruz between {{the cities of}} Nautla and Veracruz as a Category2 hurricane at 2200UTC on September29. In Nautla, communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane. The strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash, causing five deaths. Heavy rains in the Tampico, Tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda earlier in the year. The resulting flood was reported by the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans {{to be one of}} the worst natural disasters in Mexican history. In Tampico, 16in (410mm) of rain was reported. The floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak, causing over 1,000people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of <b>the</b> <b>diseases.</b> An additional 36,000people were being cared for in concentration centers. Although located south of where Janet made landfall, areas of Veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge, including the city's main streets and port. Operations along a railroad stretching from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City were stopped, after having just reopened due to Hurricane Hilda.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diseases</b> and parasites {{that affect}} {{octopuses}} have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} prion diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the prion protein, PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion, the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E
