40|$|Decision {{making in}} {{collision}} avoidance {{is one of}} the major problems in ship manoeuvring. The basis of ships collision avoidance decision making at sea is the Collision Regulations which prescribe that two encountered vessels should pass at a safe distance. In this paper, several fuzzy sets are introduced to simulate the mariners' collision avoidance decision making behaviour and their psychology. Simulation models are established on an action to avoid collision in head-on, creasing and overtaking situations, in restricted waters in <b>traffic</b> <b>separation</b> <b>schemes,</b> in restricted visibility and with obstacles. This work lays a theoretical foundation on for the development of marine traffic simulation and automatic collision avoidance systems.

40|$|Safe {{shipping}} {{is essential}} for society and different measures are taken to improve maritime safety, for example through implementation of <b>traffic</b> <b>separation</b> <b>schemes,</b> radar surveillance and traffic management concepts.

In this study, a real-time maritime safety index for a ship is developed, taking into account both the probability of grounding and the probability of collision. The index is developed using fuzzy integrated systems and validated in ship handling simulator scenarios. It uses numerical data from the simulator as an input to assess the present traffic situation from the perspective of a specific ship and outputs a comprehensive index. This paper describes the concept of sea traffic management as proposed and evaluated in the EU funded STM Validation project, the motivation for developing a maritime safety index, the numerical input variables and model properties and also validates the feasibility of the approach...|$|R

Web based GIS is a network based tool that takes advantage of internet with visualizing, analysing and accessing of distributed data and analysis functions. With the length of 30 kilometres, the Bosphorus provides an essential zone that offers great maritime traffic services. This shipping way which connects The Black Sea and The Mediterranean Sea through The Marmara Sea, has no alternative and it is substantial for economies of Black Sea countries. The Bosphorus is one of most important natural straits in the world handling 150 transit ships, 23 freighters with dangerous cargo and 2500 local transport ships with 2 million passengers on daily basis. In this study, it is aimed to create a web based GIS application for an effective coast management which includes berthing factors (anchorage areas, currents, submerged, etc.), maritime <b>traffic</b> factors (<b>traffic</b> <b>separation</b> <b>schemes,</b> <b>traffic</b> flow directions), closed areas and other factors (lighthouses, buoys, beacons, etc.) by digitizing printed navigation charts produced by Turkish Naval Forces, Office of Navigation, Hydrography and Oceanography...|$|R

40|$|Accidents at sea {{are today}} much more rare than in present days. Improvement in {{technical}} reliability {{is a large}} reason for that. And also innovation in systems that aid the human in decision-making. These systems can be technical (like the GPS and AIS), but can also be organizational (like <b>Traffic</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Schemes</b> and Safety Management Systems). Still accidents occur. IMOs e-Navigation concept aims at collecting, integrating, exchanging and presenting information to aid the awareness of dangerous situations and the analysis of risk situations. One such attempt is the route exchange concept developed in the EU projects EfficenSea, MONALISA and ACCSEAS. The idea is that by coordinating routes from all vessels in an area, close quarter situations can be predicted and avoided at an early stage. A prototype system has previously been built and tested in simulator trials with Swedish mariners with good results.

50|$|A {{comprehensive}} vessel traffic {{service is}} provided by the department's Vessel Traffic Centre (VTC), with radar surveillance and tracking capabilities as well as a fully integrated data handling sub-system, covers 95% of Hong Kong waters used by seagoing vessels and ferries. The VTC offers advice on the activities of other vessels and gives navigational information to mariners through a sectorised VHF network. This ensures the safety standard and traffic efficiency of the port. An upgraded vessel tracking system, which can track 4,000 moving vessels plus 1,000 stationary targets in real time, has been in operation since early 2002. It provides the latest technology such as AIS, ECDIS, CCTV, new VHF-direction finders and modern communications systems to further improve navigation safety and operation efficiency. Marine Department patrol launches maintain a watch on shipping, <b>traffic</b> <b>separation</b> <b>schemes,</b> fairways, navigational channels, typhoon shelter and cargo-working areas. They provide on-scene support to the VTC, and are in continuous radio contact with the VTC and local marine traffic control stations located at Ma Wan and Kwai Chung Container Port. The VTC is thus able to promptly initiate and co-ordinate actions required to facilitate safe navigation in the port.|$|R
