500|$|With Rhodes {{insisting that}} the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed {{intensely}} over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: [...] "We were almost Stalinist in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before." [...] Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said. Sometimes they would meet in the office over their Camden rehearsal studio to collaborate directly. According to a later description of Strummer's, [...] "Bernie [...] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important." ...|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 {{contains}} {{voices from}} 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording {{for the game}} took {{twice as long as}} the original Mass Effect. The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation. As Hudson explained, [...] "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you have a conversation with characters." [...] Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first Mass Effect game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.|$|E
500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with}} the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of [...] "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor's {{originality}} {{has been}} emphasized by several critics writing of her work; thus Lynn Emanuel writes of Captive Voices, [...] "It {{is a complex}} and unexpected convergence of the influences of modernism and a wholly original, native genius. Reading it one suddenly realizes that one is {{in the presence of}} an American classic." [...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made me feel that poetry was contemporary and could relate to me right now, in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know that all those wonderful heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, a {{blog post}} {{from the band}} {{expressed}} the hope that [...] "these songs will strike a chord and make a similar impact on all {{of you out there}} that were moved by this band in the first place." [...] Kinney said that the music on the album doesn't deviate too far from the band's past music, adding, [...] "It's nice to sound like yourself...It's not really that hard, actually. I know people are blown away that we really sound like ourselves, and I understand the apprehension, but it's not really that big a stretch to sound <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sound."

2500|$|On April 16, 2008, rival mayoral {{candidate}} Leonard Padilla distributed a 2007 {{report of}} similar allegations made against Johnson at St. HOPE Sacramento High School. The allegations were investigated by local police, but no charges were filed. On April 29, 2008, {{a group of}} female civic leaders including former Sacramento Mayor Ann Rudin, Sacramento Municipal Utility District board member Genevieve Shiroma, and former State Senator Deborah Ortiz demanded {{the release of the}} police report on the matter. The teacher to whom the student initially brought the complaint subsequently resigned over the incident, claiming, [...] "St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity to ask me to change my story." [...] Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel responded, saying, [...] "I think the allegations at the school were handled in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would want them handled. Immediately they followed all the normal protocols that they were supposed to follow. I think it was pretty clear there was nothing there... We did ask the young lady whether anyone had influenced her – her answer was no." [...] The Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness said on May 30, 2008, that Johnson's actions, though ill-advised, were not illegal.|$|E

[...] The sixth track on the mixtape is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Free Man in Paris" [...] which, serving {{as a tribute to}} Mitchell, was renamed [...] "White Girl in Paris". The mixtape's seventh track and second single from the tape [...] "Andre" [...] was also written by JoJo while {{production}} was handled by Mr. Franks. In discussion of the track, JoJo says [...] "Andre" [...] isn't necessarily a direct tribute to Outkast's André 3000; rather, the 37-year-old rapper/singer provided inspiration for the song. [...] "I absolutely admire André and both of the guys from Outkast — their incredible artistry and creativity," [...] she explains. [...] "The man that André is, I think that's super-sexy — someone who is themselves, who isn't confined and just expresses themselves. He has such a great style. I was inspired by that, for sure." [...] The mixtape includes music from Dropkick Murphys' [...] "I'm Shipping Up to Boston" [...] on the [...] "St. Patrick's Day Interlude".|$|E
2500|$|August was {{suffused with}} Collins's {{trademark}} drum and horn sound, and became Clapton's biggest seller in the UK to date, matching his highest chart position, number 3. The album's first track, the hit [...] "It's in <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Use It", {{was featured in}} the Tom Cruise – Paul Newman movie The Color of Money. The horn-peppered [...] "Run" [...] echoed Collins' [...] "Sussudio" [...] and other work, while [...] "Tearing Us Apart" [...] (with Tina Turner) and [...] "Miss You" [...] continued Clapton's more angry sound. This rebound kicked off Clapton's two-year period of touring with Collins and their August collaborators, bassist Nathan East and keyboard player/songwriter Greg Phillinganes. While on tour for August, two concert videos were recorded of the four-man band, Eric Clapton Live from Montreux and Eric Clapton and Friends. Clapton later remade [...] "After Midnight" [...] as a single and a promotional track for the Michelob beer brand, which had also used earlier songs by Collins and Steve Winwood. Clapton won a British Academy Television Award for his collaboration with Michael Kamen on the score for the 1985 BBC Television thriller serial Edge of Darkness. In 1989, Clapton released Journeyman, an album which covered {{a wide range of}} styles including blues, jazz, soul and pop. Collaborators included George Harrison, Phil Collins, Daryl Hall, Chaka Khan, Mick Jones, David Sanborn and Robert Cray. At the 1987 Brit Awards in London, Clapton was awarded the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music.|$|E

Library workers of all kinds are often the minority within bargaining units and, unfortunately, collective agreements often reflect this in disproportional representations of our needs.
