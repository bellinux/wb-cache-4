5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the souls of <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths {{she did not see}} before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of <b>the</b> <b>Underworld.</b> When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves <b>the</b> <b>Underworld,</b> arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E
5|$|Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which divided <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> into massive caverns {{containing}} deities {{as well as}} {{the deceased}} waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.|$|E

5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what is sought from <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing manner in which those seeking information from <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted {{manner in which the}} supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit up out of the ground to learn the future).|$|E

5|$|Calliope– Kratos' daughter. As an infant, she was {{stricken}} with the plague and {{was to be}} killed due to Sparta's law. Calliope was saved by Kratos when he obtained the Ambrosia of Asclepius, but was eventually killed with her mother by Kratos during a berserker rage in a temple dedicated to Athena. Kratos was briefly reunited with Calliope in <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> in the Fields of Elysium, but was forced to abandon her {{to save the world}} from Persephone and Atlas. Kratos later found a note from her in <b>the</b> <b>Underworld,</b> and when Kratos entered into his psyche during his final fight with Zeus, he was spiritually reunited with both Lysandra and Calliope. The character was voiced by Debi Derryberry in Chains of Olympus and God of War III.|$|E

5|$|Instrumentally, the {{two worlds}} {{represented}} within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace {{is represented by the}} strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with <b>the</b> <b>Underworld,</b> though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large L'Orfeo ensemble is typical.|$|E
5|$|Itzamna was {{the creator}} god, {{but he also}} {{embodied}} the cosmos, and was simultaneously a sun god; K'inich Ahau, the day sun, {{was one of his}} aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with K'inich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the Night Jaguar, representing the sun in its journey through <b>the</b> <b>underworld.</b> The four Pawatuns supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the Bacabs performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood. The four Chaacs were storm gods, controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains. The nine lords of the night each governed one of <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> realms. Other important deities included the moon goddess, the maize god, and the Hero Twins.|$|E
5|$|Persephone– The former Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of Chains of Olympus. Bitter at being abandoned to <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> by her fellow gods, Persephone entered into {{an alliance with}} Morpheus and then freed and used the Titan Atlas to capture the god Helios, intending to use Helios' power to destroy the Pillar of the World. Persephone offered to reunite Kratos with his daughter Calliope in the Fields of Elysium. This she did, but Kratos reluctantly abandoned Calliope and killed Persephone to stop her from destroying the Pillar, which would have in turn destroyed the Fields of Elysium and Calliope with it. In God of War III, Persephone's remains were seen in a tree casket in Hades' palace and her voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Marina Gordon in Chains of Olympus.|$|E

5000|$|The {{association}} is further {{strengthened by the}} fact that [...] "Stygian" [...] refers to the River Styx which was said to flow through <b>the</b> classical <b>Underworld,</b> and <b>the</b> three adventurers in The Silver Chair descend to <b>the</b> Narnian <b>Underworld.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in <b>the</b> <b>Underworld.</b> In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|The first story-driven game expansion, Nightmare in North Point, was {{released}} in October 2012.

5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Underworld,</b> Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in <b>the</b> <b>Underworld</b> with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through <b>the</b> <b>underworld</b> each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, God of War III {{is set in}} an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by Olympian Gods, Titans, heroes, and other characters from Greek mythology.
