5|$|Marceline {{arrives with}} Finn and Jake, and the trio learn that Simon is dying {{since he is}} over a {{thousand}} years old. As such, he wants to create a portal {{to the past and}} apologize to his fiancée Betty for making her leave him. Hambo, filled with sentimentality, is the key to <b>the</b> <b>portal.</b> Marceline, realizing that Hambo will be destroyed but that she will enable her former protector to see {{the love of his life}} for one last time, agrees. <b>The</b> <b>portal</b> is opened just moments after Simon had first put on the ice crown and scared Betty. Simon from the future appears to her, explains the situation, and apologizes. Betty, realizing what has happened jumps through <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> and kisses Simon, only for <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> to close and Simon to collapse.|$|E
5|$|A year of {{wandering}} later, {{the dark}} energy {{has begun to}} affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and {{saying that it is}} their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach <b>the</b> <b>portal,</b> they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing {{that the only way to}} close <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> is sealed, and Illusia is restored.|$|E
5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> with both ships. <b>The</b> <b>portal</b> finally closes, leaving their home planet in peace and quiet.|$|E
50|$|Once fully operational, <b>the</b> EMODnet web <b>portal</b> {{will provide}} access to various sub-portals, each of which {{pertains}} to a specific thematic group, with some overlap. The thematic groups allow the appropriate experts to define a common structure for the data within each theme, thus ensuring interoperability. Presently, there are seven sub-portals under construction: <b>the</b> Hydrography <b>Portal,</b> <b>the</b> Geology <b>Portal,</b> <b>the</b> Physical Parameters <b>Portal,</b> <b>the</b> Chemical <b>Portal,</b> <b>the</b> Biological Data <b>Portal,</b> <b>the</b> Physical Habitats <b>Portal,</b> and <b>the</b> Human Activities <b>Portal.</b> <b>The</b> result will be a portfolio of seamless data layers across European and adjacent sea basins.

5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of <b>the</b> <b>Portal</b> Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has <b>the</b> <b>Portal</b> Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain <b>the</b> <b>Portal</b> Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover <b>the</b> <b>Portal</b> Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed to the next level on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Silver forces Jim {{to use the}} map, {{directing}} them to {{a portal}} that opens on any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> {{to the center of}} Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a space station built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet begins to fall apart, Silver, trying to hold onto a boat-load of gold, opts to let it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the Legacy, which is damaged and unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the Legacy towards <b>the</b> <b>portal.</b> At the last moment, Jim sets <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the Legacy safely clear the destruction.|$|E
5|$|The Orcs {{enlarged}} <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> {{until they}} could transport seven warriors, who massacred a Human village. The raiding party brought back samples of good food and fine worksmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights.

50|$|At {{this point}} Cornell confesses his suspicions to Porsche. She {{is not just}} another {{explorer}} from Earth, but originally came from another planet altogether using a portal. Porsche admits that this is true. Her people wander from world to world gaining knowledge of different cultures. She joined the project to locate others with the talent to use <b>the</b> <b>portals.</b> <b>The</b> glass disks represent portals to safe worlds, but they can only be opened by equipment that her people know how to make. <b>The</b> <b>portals</b> used by <b>the</b> CEA are not safe, but can be opened by the brute force of the equipment that the CEA has made. The CEA has been growing rich and influential by exploiting technological knowledge found on other worlds, but is becoming aware that others like Porsche {{know how to use}} <b>the</b> <b>portals.</b> <b>The</b> knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>portals</b> is being kept secret, which makes it dangerous for Porsche's people to reveal themselves.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} competition between two advertising-financed media firms, and we apply the model to analyze competition between por-tals on the Internet. First, we show that equilibrium prices of advertising are actually higher the less differentiated <b>the</b> <b>portals</b> are perceived to be. Second, we show that aggregate profit for <b>the</b> <b>portals</b> increases if they form each their vertical alliance with advertisers. This is true {{even if there is}} perfect competition between the advertisers for advertising space. However, we also demonstrate that it may be individually profitable for one of <b>the</b> <b>portals</b> not to form a vertical alliance if <b>the</b> <b>portals</b> are close substitutes. In that case we end up with an asymmetric equilibrium with only one vertical alliance. This happens despite the fact that aggregate profit would be higher with two vertical alliances...|$|R

The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo.

30|$|The second smaller peak {{in force}} {{direction}} in both planes (α and β) observed around −[*] 90 ° in the posterior and posterolateral compartment (Fig. 4 b and c) seems attributable to suboptimal portal placement as expert 1 who created <b>the</b> <b>portals</b> had a substantial share {{in this second}} peak, particularly in the first specimen.

5|$|Once a {{particular}} level has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. The keys that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, the keys that unlock <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> to the fourth level are found in the second level, the keys that unlock <b>the</b> <b>portal</b> to the fifth level are found in the third level, and the keys that unlock the last level are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.|$|E
