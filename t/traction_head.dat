40|$|This thesis {{asks whether}} the rural {{residential}} estate {{is a human}} settlement space in which society can live ‘better’ with nature. Answering this question hinges on the identification of zones of friction and zones of <b>traction</b> (<b>Head</b> et al, in prep.) in the rural residential estate – ruptures and resiliences created by this unique experiment in urban design, and expressed through the everyday rhythms of residents. The thesis evaluates the rural residential estate using the study site of Nangarin Vineyard Estate, located near Picton, NSW. The materiality of this setting incorporates residential landuse and remnant bushland, facilitating an enmeshing of humans and non-humans in space. The study is conceptually framed around non-representational theory, a relational ontology used to re-frame the complexity of interactions between human and non-human actors. Reflecting this, semi-structured walking {{interviews were conducted with}} Nangarin residents to both enrol the non-human in research design, and to explore how residents have constructed their use the estate. This method was combined with frequent self-tours of the estate, to elicit place-based engagement for the researcher. Results presented over four chapters explore the complexity of interactions that take place between humans and nature in Nangarin estate. The first contextualises the urban design and regulatory framework of the rural residential estate, and how this material framework shapes the potential for its use. The second and third chapters explore the interactions expressed between humans and nature with respect to mobility and how they dwell – how the rural residential estate informs their everyday rhythms, and subsequent construction of their home space. This thesis concludes that despite the material shell created by the rural residential estate, there is still a fixity expressed by humans towards how they enrol the non-human. This involved the creation of borders and territories that serve to exclude the non-human. The final chapter brings the threads of the thesis together, exploring zones of friction and zones of traction in the rural residential estate. Such frictions and tractions present opportunities and threats for pursuing future developments of this nature...|$|E

5000|$|Like all TGV variants, the KTX-I is a {{permanently}} coupled trainset {{that consists}} of two <b>traction</b> <b>heads,</b> that is powered end cars carrying no passengers, flanking a fixed set of passenger cars or trailers that are articulated with Jacobs bogies between them. Though the KTX-I {{is based on the}} TGV Réseau, it has 18 instead of 8 passenger cars, making them the longest member of the TGV family with a monobloc configuration, that is a single set of articulated cars. The two normal (non-Jacobs) bogies next to the <b>traction</b> <b>heads</b> under the two extreme passenger cars are motorised, like on the TGV Sud-Est. Further traits differentiating the KTX-I from all European variants are the supply voltage frequency of 60 Hz (instead of 50 Hz), rotating seats in the First Class sections, the lack of any bar or restaurant cars. [...] Original plans in 1993 proposed a new [...] "showel nose" [...] design, with the underside of the nose closer to the track, for better aerodynamics in tunnels; however, the final design was only a slightly modified version of another TGV export version, the AVE Class 100 for Spain.|$|R

40|$|OBSTETRICAL BRACHIAL PLEXUS PALSY Margareta Mollberg Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Institute for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden Background: Obstetric {{brachial plexus}} palsy (OBPP) at birth is one {{important}} cause of neurological disability {{in children and}} adults; the incidence has increased substantially in Sweden over the past decade. Several risk factors for OBPP have been identified, e. g. high birth weight and shoulder dystocia, but it remains difficult to predict based on antenatally available information. Despite extensive research on OBPP, there is no generally accepted strategy for prevention. The overall objective of this thesis is to study predisposing risk factors for OBPP in vaginally delivered infants and to identify specific obstetric procedures that are strongly associated with OBPP. Based on this knowledge, our ultimate aim {{is to develop a}} prevention strategy with respect to manual assistance in the second stage of labour. Methods: Paper I reports on a retrospective case-control study aimed at investigation of the incidence and risk factors for OBPP in a large population studied in 1987 - 1997. All deliveries recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register during the period were investigated. Cases of OBPP were compared with all cases without OBPP. Paper II describes a retrospective case-control study, the purpose of which was to identify risk factors for OBPP, specifically in women delivered by vacuum extraction. The groups with and without OBPP were compared with regard to possible risk factors, including those linked to the vacuum extraction procedure. The aim of the prospective population-based case-control study presented in Paper III was to evaluate the association between OBPP and obstetric manoeuvres during the second stage of delivery. Obstetric management in OBPP cases was compared to management in a randomly selected control group. Paper IV and Paper III are based on the same cases. The aims of the study presented in Paper IV were a) to describe neurological deficits in children with remaining OBPP at 18 months of age; b) to compare maternal, infant and obstetric data in infants with and without OBPP at 18 months of age and c) to evaluate if differences in force applied in downward <b>traction</b> of the <b>head</b> (ranked on a 100 -point visual analogue scale) correlated to the number of affected nerve roots (C 5 -C 6, C 5 -C 7, C 5 -Th 1). Results: The incidence of OBPP in Sweden increased from 0. 17 % to 0. 27 % between 1987 and 1997. Infants with high birth weight, especially > 4500 g, were at increased risk of shoulder dystocia and OBPP. However, high birth weight was not or only weakly over- represented among children with persistent OBPP, compared with those who recovered, suggesting that other factors are important. Hence, many factors related to prolonged second stage and difficulties in delivering the shoulders were overrepresented in the OBPP group, compared to controls. In particular, forceful downward traction applied to the head after the fetal third rotation represented an important risk factor for OBPP in cephalic-presentation vaginal deliveries. Downward <b>traction</b> of the <b>head</b> had been applied more often and with greater force in the group with persistent damage and there was a significant correlation between the force used and the number of affected nerve roots. Conclusion: We have confirmed that well known factors such as birth weight and shoulder dystocia are indeed important risk factors for OBPP. Furthermore, obstetric procedures, especially forceful downward <b>traction</b> of the <b>head,</b> conferred additional risk of OBPP at birth, as well as at follow-up at age 18 months. Our data suggest that forceful downward <b>traction</b> of the <b>head</b> should be avoided and indicate that other measures should be taken to release the impacted shoulder, e g. maximal flexion of the maternal hips, rotation of the shoulders and/ or extraction of the posterior arm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The fine {{particulate}} matter component of diesel engine exhaust {{has been declared}} {{by the state of}} California to be a human carcinogen at any concentration and is therefore subject to measures for its reduction or total elimination.

This paper will discuss a conceptual design substituting gas turbines for the main <b>traction</b> engine and <b>head</b> end power (HEP) engine of a typical diesel electric commuter locomotive. Retention of the existing HEP engine while replacing the traction engine will also be evaluated. Elimination of major reduction of measurable {{particulate matter}} as well as significant reductions in other exhaust pollutants is projected while burning conventional diesel # 2 fuel oil. Since the gas turbine readily adapts to natural gas as a fuel without any loss in performance, the economics and further emissions benefits will be developed for the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel as well...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of Brooks' posterior stabilisation and fusion for the unstable atlantoaxial joint due to congenital dysplastic dens and trauma. METHODS: We retrospectively studied records of 54 patients (36 males and 18 females; age range, 3 - 58 years) who underwent Brooks' posterior stabilisation procedure between March 1975 and December 1999, at the Catholic University of Korea Medical Center and Dong-Shin General Hospital, Seoul. A single-stranded Kirschner wire was used to stabilise the first 19 cases (thin wires in 12 cases and thick wires in 7), and double-stranded wires {{were used in the}} next 35 cases (thin wires in 4 cases and thick wires in 31). After surgery, patients were immobilised in bed with light Halter <b>traction</b> of the <b>head,</b> followed by cervical bracing. RESULTS: Fusion was observed by X-ray postoperatively at 15 weeks in 48 patients. Reduction was achieved in 3 luxation cases (including the single case of rotatory fixation). Brooks' fusion failed in 4 patients with dens fractures and 2 with dens anomaly. Four dens fractures in cases of successful Brooks' fusion in Brooks' fusion did not unite. Wire failure occurred in 4 cases of thin single-stranded wire fixation, namely, 2 cases of dens fractures and 2 of dens anomaly.

Presentation of the case: We present a case of a 62 year-old female, that suffered from shoulder fracture-dislocation. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed in the so-called “beach-chair” position, under combined general-regional anesthesia. In the postoperative period complete motor brachial plexus palsy appeared, with neuropathic pain. Conservative treatment included analgesic drugs, neuromodulators, B-vitamin complex and physiotherapy. Spontaneous recovery appeared at 11 months.

30|$|A {{report by}} Cotrel and Morel {{is the first}} strong {{suggestion}} that serial casting might {{be used as a}} corrective measure in EOS [11]. In their report, they detailed the casting technique and presented their results in 75 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Cotrel and Morel’s technique differs from Risser’s method in the way that de-rotational force is applied. Both traction and posterolaterally directed force over the rib prominence was used in Risser’s localizer cast method which implies that Risser also employed de-rotation of the thoracic cage and therefore the spine. On the other hand, Cotrel and Morel applied the corrective force through straps instead of a localizer and specifically called it de-rotation. In the description of their elongation, de-rotation and lateral flexion (EDF) method they specified the corrective forces on the spinal column—elongation is achieved by applying longitudinal traction to the spine through pelvic straps and halter <b>head</b> <b>traction.</b> De-rotation is achieved with straps that wrap around the rib prominence and pull in an oblique fashion perpendicular to the ribs. Lateral flexion is also achieved by straps pulling laterally as well by adjusting the pelvic and halter traction in a differential manner. Although the results were not presented in detail, the authors indicated that if the treatment is started early in infants with scoliosis, spinal growth may be harnessed in order to control the deformity progression. In juvenile cases they used the cast application as an adjunct to posterior arthrodesis, similar to the turnbuckle and localizer body casts.|$|R

Tarnier forceps (and its multiple derivatives under other names) remained the most widely used system in the world until the development of the cesarean section.|$|R
50|$|The University of Marylands Thomas R. Holtz Jr. has {{proposed}} that Tyrannosaurus attacked prey like canids and hyaenids do; seizing and killing prey with the jaws, with limited {{use of the}} forelimbs for capture and dispatch. Holtz pointed out that Tyrannosaurus had stout, strong teeth and a bony palate; both of which would have enabled Tyrannosaurus to resist greater twisting loads and occasional bone contact than allosaurids or other typical theropds. Holtz elaborated that the incrassate (thickened) teeth of Tyrannosaurus were mechanically stronger than those of other theropods, with deep roots to withstand lateral forces during predation or feeding with a greater torsional component. Furthermore, Tyrannosaurus had a solidly built bony secondary palate found at the roof of its mouth that would also have strengthened it against torsional loads, a similar adaptation to that of crocodiles but uncommon amongst other theropods. In a lecture on 2013, Thomas Holtz Jr. would point out that torsion is encountered when biting into struggling prey and Tyrannosaurus resistance to torsional loads showed that it used a puncture and pull method {{as opposed to the}} bite and slice of many other theropods. He would also elaborate that like many reptiles, many dinosaurs did not have a hard palate. Tyrannosaurus, however had a hard palate, just like mammals and crocodiles. Holtz along with James O. Farlow would also support freelance researcher Gregory S. Pauls suggestion that Tyrannosaurus could have used hit-and-run attacks on its prey. Gregory S. Paul has suggested that Tyrannosaurus was a high risk predator that also attacked massive and dangerous prey; citing this as a reason tyrannosaurs died young. He would indicate that the fossil evidence of animals that surviving tyrannosaur attacks show that these animals were at least healthy enough to heal from their injuries; even suggesting the possibility that some of them may have been able to kill the attacker. Paul wrote that Triceratops were probably Tyrannosaurus most challenging and dangerous prey; with horns and parrot like beaks that they could use for defence. and that Tyrannosaurus did not attack horned animals such as Triceratops head-on because that would have maximized the danger while lessening the chance of success. Instead Tyrannosaurus would attack these prey from behind, attempting to bite either the thigh or the caudofemoralis muscle to disable its prey. The Tyrannosaurus would have done this through either ambushing or trying to intimidate the horned animals into trying to run away which would have then exposed these animals to attack.David A. Krauss and John M. Robinson proposed that Tyrannosaurus could have used a hunting strategy similar in concept to “cow tipping” against Triceratops, where the Tyrannosaurus would ambush and knock the Triceratops over to fall on its side. This strategy, according to the Krauss and Robinson could explain the unique characteristics of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus small, yet strong arms could have been adapted to grasp onto the back of Triceratops while pushing with its pectoral region, its large clawed feet would have given it better <b>traction,</b> its large <b>head</b> could have been used to tip the Triceratops over and its large mouth and bone piercing teeth would have made bites to the side more efficient and deadly. When the Triceratops had fallen over to its side, Tyrannosaurus would then bitten it at the rib cage; killing it. Krauss and Robinson backed up their proposal through physical analyses; finding that Tyrannosaurus moving at moderate speed could have generated enough force to topple Triceratops and would have only taken 2-3 seconds. Their study suggested that a Tyrannosaurus impacting the Triceratops at a conservative estimated speed of 7.5 meters per second would have enabled it to topple Triceratops without injuring itself, though there could be some variance depending on the sizes of the animals (Tyrannosaurus could have attacked a smaller Triceratops). Furthermore, their study noted that Triceratops would have experienced some difficulty quickly getting back up from being toppled on to its side. According to the study, modern day analogues of Triceratops such as rhinoceros, camels and large bovids, experience the same kind of difficulty, taking 3-10 seconds to recover. But Triceratops may have experienced more difficulty due to its frill. According to the study, Tyrannosaurus arms were adapted for this strategy, pushing the prey with its chest while gripping it with its arms reduced the chance of the prey slipping away while being pushed. The arms, being short yet strong reduced the chance of joint injury during this struggle. Also having more of the arms power concentrated on its flexors instead of the extensors, were ideal since it would have had to flex its arms to keep its prey close. When the Tyrannosaurus is pressed against the side of Tricieratops, its arms were at the right height to reach the spine of the Triceratops, providing a place to grip on. Furthermore, Krauss and Robinson suggest that this strategy would have been effective against other large ceratopsians and because the attack was done through an ambush, Tyrannosaurus would not have needed to compete in speed. Gregory S. Paul also discussed the defenses that hadrosaurs may have employed against tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus. Paul stated that duck-billed dinosaurs may have been able to kick out with its heavy footed hindlimbs. When faced with a predator, some duckbills were large and may have been able to use their size for protection, otherwise that the only apparent option for them to escape was to flee at maximum speed while attempting to land kicks on its pursuer. He would write that hadrosaurs, while using its forelimbs for locomotion, may have been able out turn tyrannosaurids. Paul wrote that hadrosaurs may have been gregarious (lived in groups) and may have prioritized trying to lose itself in the herd. He would also note that hadrosaurs were also lower slung than their predators and may have therefor been able to use their forelimbs to push themselves through heavy vegetation; making it difficult for their predators to deliver effective bites.|$|R
