5|$|One of the accused, Demdike, {{had been}} {{regarded}} {{in the area}} as a witch for fifty years, {{and some of the}} deaths the witches were accused of had happened many years before Roger Nowell started to take an interest in 1612. The event <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{conversation}} with Emma, Mary Margaret Blanchard volunteers at Storybrooke Hospital, placing flowers {{at the bedside}} of patients. She stops in the ICU where a John Doe (Dallas), Prince Charming, is sleeping in a coma. Mary Margaret is unaware of who he is. Meanwhile, at the Mayor's home, Regina takes the book from Henry's room and goes downstairs {{to look at her}} mirror, with an expression <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to acknowledge she is aware of her fairy tale existence.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a murder <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have been committed by a blind woman, Marty Glenn (Lili Taylor), but Mulder suspects that she is capable of seeing images in some other way. Eventually, it is revealed that Glenn, while blind, can see the actions of her murderous father via her mind's eye.|$|E

5|$|After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti had won an {{international}} competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art, the new 3,000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012, consisting of ground- and lower-ground-level interior spaces {{topped by a}} golden, undulating roof (fashioned from almost 9,000 steel tubes that form an interior web) <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to float within the neo-Classical Visconti Courtyard {{in the middle of}} the Louvre's south wing. The galleries, which the museum had initially hoped to open by 2009, represent the first major architectural intervention at the Louvre since the addition of I.M. Pei's glass pyramid in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, {{it was broken}} in two parts {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close family ties to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed {{as that of a}} servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress {{is still on the}} bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
5|$|Many Scottish {{painters}} {{of the early}} part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans. Roderick Chalmers' (fl. 1709–30) painting The Edinburgh Trades (1720) shows the artist himself, perhaps ironically, among the glaziers, wrights and masons of the burgh. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) produced the Allegorical Still Life (after 1708), of a letter board <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to be a commentary on the union of 1707, but he made his living as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began in the tradition of the Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{difficult}} to excavate, as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation. A defensive system against floods, composed of a circular embankment was unearthed, {{in addition to a}} circular 6.7m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies. An area of 300 meters long filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters, separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters, and was strengthened by defensive towers. Other findings include one of the city gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, in addition to residential houses. Mari had a central mound, however no temple or palaces have been unearthed, although a large building <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to have been an administrative one was unearthed which had stone foundations and dimensions of (32 meters X 25 meters), with rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide. The city was abandoned {{at the end of the}} Early Dynastic period II c. 2550 BC for unknown reasons.|$|E

5|$|The other text <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> {{to support}} the case for Arthur's {{historical}} existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historias account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source {{to support the}} Historia Brittonums account. The latest {{research shows that the}} Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added {{at some point in the}} 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
