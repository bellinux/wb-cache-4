5000|$|A <b>transflective</b> {{liquid-crystal display}} is a liquid-crystal display (LCD) that {{reflects}} and transmits light (<b>transflective</b> is a portmanteau of transmissive and reflective). Under bright illumination (e.g. {{when exposed to}} daylight) the display acts mainly as a reflective display with the contrast being constant with illuminance. Only in dim and dark ambient situations is an auxiliary transmissive backlight needed.|$|E

50|$|While {{internal}} hardware varies, {{most have}} an electronic visual display, either backlit LCD or OLED. Some use <b>transflective</b> or electronic paper, to consume less power. Most have a rechargeable battery {{and many have}} a touchscreen. Peripheral devices may include digital cameras, thermometers, accelerometers, altimeters, barometers, compasses, GPS receivers, tiny speakers, and SD card (that are recognized as a storage device by a computer).|$|E
5000|$|An early {{application}} were digital LCD [...] wristwatches. In dim ambient light or at night a pushbutton-activated backlight allowed {{reading of the}} display in its transmissive mode. Digital time displays in alarm clocks for bedrooms still work this way. The backlighting is dim, so that the display is comfortably readable at night. Some 21st century smartwatches such as the Pebble Smartwatch also use <b>transflective</b> LCDs.|$|E
50|$|Dedicated {{devices have}} {{various degrees of}} mobility. Hand-held, outdoor, or sport {{receivers}} have replaceable batteries that can run them for several hours, making them suitable for hiking, bicycle touring and other activities far from an electric power source. Their screens are small, and some do not show color, in part to save power. Some use <b>transflective</b> liquid-crystal displays, allowing use in bright sunlight. Cases are rugged and some are water resistant.|$|E
5000|$|The Tungsten E2, {{introduced}} on April 13, 2005 {{replaced the}} similarly named Tungsten E, has 32 MB of memory (29.7 available), a 200 MHz Intel XScale processor, 320x320 <b>Transflective</b> TFT color display, and runs Palm OS Garnet v5.4.7.

50|$|Another {{important}} feature of the Hiptop2 {{is the ability to}} easily view the screen even without a backlight. All units until the LX model had this feature. Most other manufacturers utilized an LCD screen that was not visible without backlight. Hiptop and Palm Treo units (Treo 600 and later) utilized a <b>transflective</b> liquid crystal display that worked with and without the backlight, making the IM, mail, and all other messages readable even in bright sunlight, and without picking the unit up.|$|E
50|$|The E5-00 is {{very similar}} to the E72. It has more DRAM memory than the E72 but also has some {{important}} cost reductions. One cost reduction is the technology of the LCDs screen. The E5-00 has a transmissive LCD display while the E-72 has a <b>transflective</b> LCD. E5 supports only 256k display colors. Other important cost reductions are the removal of the secondary camera, the accelerometer and the digital compass. The third is the full focus for the camera, instead of autofocus.|$|E
50|$|The WIMM One has a <b>transflective</b> bi-modal screen. In {{high power}} mode it can {{reproduce}} colour images with an 18-bit colour depth (OS limited to 16-bit). In low-power mode it can reproduce 4-bit grayscale images. The WIMM One's screen is {{on all the}} time the device is powered on. This allows information to be readily available to the user without them having to interact with the device. When the device is in low power mode the screen is updated once per minute. When the device is woken into high-power mode the screen refreshes at 60 fps and fully interactive apps can be run.|$|E
5000|$|Each Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress {{machine costs}} about £30,000 to {{purchase}} and install. [...] Machines are 4+1/2 ft tall and 3 ft wide. They {{can have a}} depth of either 1+1/2 ft or 1.8 ft depending on the style of casing, which in either case is built of 0.08 in thick steel with a steel and aluminium door of 0.12 in thickness. A 15 in <b>transflective</b> liquid-crystal display touchscreen forms the user interface. [...] Early machines had their screens placed too high for wheelchair users, so were not Disability Discrimination Act-compliant. From early 2005, the layout was redesigned so that the screen was lower, and older machines were converted to make them accessible.|$|E
50|$|The Sony SmartWatch 2, model SW2, was {{launched}} in late September 2013.The SW2 supports working together with any Android 4.0 (and higher) smartphone, unlike Samsung's competing Galaxy Gear smartwatch, which only works with some of Samsung's own Galaxy handsets.

Even though slightly smaller (144×77×13 mm, 170 g) {{than the original}} HP-42S (148×80×15 mm, 170 g), the calculator comes with an additional top row of keys for soft menus, a keyboard layout supporting direct alpha character input, a much larger high-contrast display (Sharp low power <b>transflective</b> memory LCD with a resolution of 400×240, protected by Gorilla Glass) showing all four stack levels at once, ca. 77 KB usable RAM, a beeper, a callable real-time clock {{as well as an}} infrared port for HP 82240A/HP 82240B printer support and an USB interface (with Micro-USB plug) emulating a FAT16-formatted USB mass storage device for easy program transfer and state backup / transfer as well as for firmware updates. The calculator, which comes in a stainless steel case with black PVD (Physical vapor deposition) coating, supports keyboard overlays and is based on a modified version of Thomas Okken's GPLed Free42 simulator with Intel's decimal floating-point math library for higher precision (decimal128) running on an STM32L476RG processor (ARM Cortex-M4 core, 128 KB RAM, 1 MB internal flash) with another 8 MB of external flash (of which ca. 6 MB are available to users). It is powered by a CR2032 coin cell or via USB and clocked dynamically at 24-80 MHz.|$|E
50|$|The Nokia N900 has a 3.5 in {{resistive}} touchscreen with {{a resolution}} of 800 × 480 pixel (WVGA, 267 ppi). According to both Nokia and the Xorg.log, {{it is capable of}} displaying up to 65k colours (565 RGB). Nokia N900 camera capability is 2592x1944 pixels, Carl Zeiss optics, autofocus, Dual LED flash, video light, geo-tagging The LCD is <b>transflective</b> to permit usability over a wide range of luminosity (from daylight to dark). Haptic feedback is provided to touchscreen input by applying a small vibration or a sound; the user can choose whether to have this feature enabled. A stylus is provided to allow more precise touch input and access to smaller user interface elements. A 3-axis accelerometer allows the orientation of the screen to change between portrait and landscape mode in certain applications, or it can be used as user input in games and applications. While the dashboard or desktop is active, rotating the device from landscape to portrait mode activates the phone application (a feature that can also be disabled at user discretion). With update PR1.2, It became possible to view web pages in portrait mode. Developers may add support for portrait mode in their applications if desired. There is a proximity sensor which deactivates the display and touchscreen when the device is brought near the face during a call.|$|E
