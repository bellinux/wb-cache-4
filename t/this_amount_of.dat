5|$|Paralleling the coastline, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a light storm surge that peaked at 2.6feet (0.8m) above normal on Sanibel Island. In some locations, the surge rose rapidly, and, despite the unusual {{geography of the}} area, the levels varied only {{by as much as}} 9.8inches (250mm) than the predicted levels from the SLOSH model. The surge and waves caused minor beach erosion. Moderate to heavy rainfall fell across western Florida, peaking at 6.14 inches (156 mm) near Bradenton; the rainfall was beneficial after a very dry summer, though, because it fell quickly, even <b>this</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> precipitation failed to relieve water restrictions across the area. The storm resulted in some flooding in its path, including some several homes in Manatee County, roadways, and two U.S. highways.

25|$|About 6 MeV of the fission-input {{energy is}} {{supplied}} by the simple binding of an extra neutron to the heavy nucleus via the strong force; however, in many fissionable isotopes, <b>this</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy {{is not enough for}} fission. Uranium-238, for example, has a near-zero fission cross section for neutrons of less than one MeV energy. If no additional energy is supplied by any other mechanism, the nucleus will not fission, but will merely absorb the neutron, as happens when U-238 absorbs slow and even some fraction of fast neutrons, to become U-239. The remaining energy to initiate fission can be supplied by two other mechanisms: one of these is more kinetic energy of the incoming neutron, which is increasingly able to fission a fissionable heavy nucleus as it exceeds a kinetic energy of one MeV or more (so-called fast neutrons). Such high energy neutrons are able to fission U-238 directly (see thermonuclear weapon for application, where the fast neutrons are supplied by nuclear fusion). However, this process cannot happen to a great extent in a nuclear reactor, as too small a fraction of the fission neutrons produced by any type of fission have enough energy to efficiently fission U-238 (fission neutrons have a mode energy of 2 MeV, but a median of only 0.75 MeV, meaning half of them have less than this insufficient energy).|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, Fox {{said that}} the project was a [...] "reboot" [...] of the Alien franchise, and soon {{afterwards}} was reported as an untitled prequel to Alien. Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former television advertisement director Carl Erik Rinsch as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project if Scott directed. By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct Alien prequel. With the director and writer in place, and pleased with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was eventually canceled. In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011. Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay. In October 2010, Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest <b>this</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money, and wanted to ensure the film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.|$|E

Other scholars give other numbers, however. Hsu claims that 50 mu (about 5.7 acres) was in fact [...] "the acreage needed for subsistence living," [...] while Wang Zhongshu calculates that [...] "there was on the average 24.6 mou per family, or less than 6 mou per person (with each mou equivalent to 456 square m)."

After the layoff of 800 employees on March 31, 2009, about 100 employees remained on the project until all technical staff were laid off by the end of FY 2010 due to zero funding in the 2011 budget for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.

500|$|Over 7,548 unique {{characters}} {{participated in}} the overall battle, of which 6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with a maximum of 2,670 in system at the same time. These numbers included 717 unique player corporations and involved 55 unique player alliances. Joystiq called the battle potentially the largest recorded PvP battle in any game to date. The 21-hour-long conflict resulted {{in the loss of}} 75 Titans, 13 supercarriers, 370 Dreadnoughts, and 123 Carriers, along with thousands of smaller ships and innumerable fighters and drones. N3 and Pandemic Legion lost 59 Titans, while the CFC and Russian coalition lost only 16. An estimated 11 trillion ISK in assets was lost during the battle, and media outlets reported the battle as the biggest and most expensive in EVE Onlines history, estimating that the battle cost $300,000–$330,000 in real-world money. This estimate comes from a figure listed in the official report by CCP Games, which the report based off a theoretical conversion of pilot license extensions, or PLEX, into real-world USD. While direct conversion of real currency into ISK, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited, and PLEX units are purchasable in-game, additional PLEX units can be purchased for $20 USD, and it is from this theoretical real-world value that the estimated dollar amounts lost in the battle are drawn. However, this does not mean <b>this</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> real-world money was expended, as many ships were purchased through in-game currency or corporation assets. Dr. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, an economist hired by CCP Games to oversee EVE Onlines economy, stated that [...] "To me, as an economist, that doesn’t really matter.
