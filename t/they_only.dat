5|$|All {{students}} study French, {{which is}} taught by language immersion, a technique in which <b>they</b> <b>only</b> speak French during language study. All {{signs in the}} building are written in both French and English. Students begin French instruction in junior kindergarten, and continue on to study French {{four times a week}} in groups one through eight. They culminate their study with a week-long experience in Quebec in group eight, during which <b>they</b> <b>only</b> speak French.|$|E

They are not beautiful: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> decorated. <b>They</b> are not clean: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> shaved and starched. They are not dignified: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> fashionably dressed. <b>They</b> are not educated <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> college passmen. <b>They</b> are not religious: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> pewrenters. <b>They</b> are not moral: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> conventional. <b>They</b> are not virtuous: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> cowardly. <b>They</b> are not even vicious: <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> [...] "frail."

5|$|Pečarič was {{supported}} by non-aligned Majda Širca, independent Slavko Gaber and Roberto Battelli, representative of the Italian minority in Slovenia. Krajnc and Piberl were supported by non-parliamentary political parties so <b>they</b> <b>only</b> needed to collect 3,000 support votes.|$|E
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although <b>they</b> <b>only</b> survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|An {{exchange-traded}} fund {{based on the}} Egyptian stock market listed at the NYSE Euronext increased by 5% following the announcement. Egyptian five-year credit default swaps fell by 0.25%. Al Arabiya reported that the military council said it would sack the cabinet and dissolve parliament, although <b>they</b> <b>only</b> did the latter. Celebrations and car honking were reported in Alexandria and Cairo. Celebratory gunfire in Gaza.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{morphological}} {{differences between}} these subspecies, as <b>they</b> may <b>only</b> differ slightly in color, and <b>they</b> are <b>only</b> separated by geographical barriers, including large rivers in Central and South America.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{franchise}} differs between individual voters, various markers may be placed next to voters' names to identify in which elections {{they are entitled}} to vote. European Union citizens who are not Commonwealth or Irish citizens have their entry prefixed either with G (meaning <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> vote in local government elections) or K (meaning <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> vote in European Parliamentary and local government elections). Overseas electors are prefixed with the letter F, meaning <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> vote in European and UK Parliamentary elections. Members of the House of Lords residing in the UK are prefixed with the letter L, meaning <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> vote in European Parliamentary and local government elections, whilst peers who are overseas electors are prefixed with the letter E, indicating that <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> vote in European Parliamentary elections.|$|R

5|$|Before {{the local}} protein {{synthesis}} hypothesis gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring <b>they</b> <b>only</b> reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Brugge now {{needed to}} score, but <b>they</b> <b>only</b> created one more chance. Ten {{minutes before the}} end of the match, Sørensen intercepted a Hansen backpass and shot. His shot was blocked by Clemence, and a {{goal-line}} clearance by Phil Thompson prevented Brugge from equalising. The match remained at 1–0 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup, becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.|$|E
5|$|During the {{shooting}} in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, <b>they</b> <b>only</b> shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster wished he {{had more time to}} work on the free-fall scene.|$|E
50|$|Firearms {{issued to}} the police are adapted so that <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> fire semi-automatic, meaning that <b>they</b> can <b>only</b> {{discharge}} one round with each pull of the trigger, opposed to fully automatics as used by the armed forces.|$|R
50|$|It {{is notable}} that {{virtually}} every company claiming to supply Gerovital H3 to the U. S. warns of widespread distribution of fake formulations. Some companies suggest that products supplied by its competitors are phony (while asserting that <b>they</b> and <b>only</b> <b>they</b> are the <b>only</b> supplier {{of the real}} Romanian formula).|$|R

5|$|Horses must {{lie down}} to reach REM sleep. <b>They</b> <b>only</b> {{have to lie}} down {{for an hour or}} two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may {{suddenly}} collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{a recall}} vote was held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who {{killed his wife}} and son before {{committing}} suicide in June 2007, should remain in the hall. To have Benoit removed, Meltzer required that 60% of voters must agree with the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, <b>they</b> <b>only</b> represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit remains on the list of inductees.|$|E
5|$|Millwall began {{life on the}} Isle of Dogs and {{inhabited}} {{four different}} grounds in the club's first 25 years. Their first home {{was a piece of}} waste ground called Glengall Road, where <b>they</b> <b>only</b> stayed for one year. From 1886 to 1890 they played behind The Lord Nelson pub on East Ferry Road, which was known as the Lord Nelson Ground, before being forced to leave by the landlady, who received a better offer for its use.|$|E

5|$|NOI {{leaders were}} angry that Clarence13X freely taught {{portions}} of their doctrine that <b>they</b> <b>only</b> revealed to committed members; although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop, he refused. Clarence13X also experienced conflict within his family: his children did not revere him, and hostility quickly developed between core Five Percenters {{and some of his}} sons when Willeen Jowers brought them to visit him.|$|E
5|$|Phenomena {{associated}} with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which {{are similar to}} shadows {{on the bottom of}} a swimming pool. <b>They</b> <b>only</b> occur just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source.|$|E
5|$|Sattler assists the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, in {{a search}} for survivors, but <b>they</b> <b>only</b> find an injured Malcolm, before the Tyrannosaurus returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. Later, they {{discover}} the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Vijithapura was {{a decisive}} and major {{battle in the}} {{campaign}} carried out by Sri Lankan king Dutthagamani against the invading South Indian king Elara. The battle is documented in detail in the ancient chronicles of the country. However, <b>they</b> <b>only</b> provide the viewpoint of Dutthagamani and his army, and details are scarce on Elara's side.|$|E
5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because <b>they</b> <b>only</b> had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of the}} hull also meant that they were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
