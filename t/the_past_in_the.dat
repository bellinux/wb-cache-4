5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, following an accident, Captain Jonathan Archer's (Scott Bakula) long term memory is affected and he is relieved of duty. The crew of the Enterprise subsequently fail to stop the Xindi attack on Earth resulting in {{the remnants of the}} human race resettling another planet. Dr Phlox (John Billingsley) finds a way of curing Archer in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope that it would undo everything since the Captain was originally injured.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|Georgina Sparks (Michelle Trachtenberg), who {{has just}} come back in New York, then teams up with the priest {{in an act of}} revenge for {{everything}} Blair has done to her in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, Serena continues to show an interest in Dan (Penn Badgley), even though he is still unaware of her love. Nate (Chace Crawford) reflects on his past failed relationships, while also taking an interest in Lola, who happens to be the real Charlie Rhodes. Blair 's mother tries to dissuade her from marrying Louis but she doesn't want to listen to her so she finds help in Chuck, who agrees to try to convince Blair to stop the wedding. Meanwhile, Georgina tries to seduce Louis and have her husband film it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as Rufus and Lily stop her.|$|E

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{is found}} {{regularly}} from Mumbai (sometimes north to Gujarat, and in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lakshadweep Islands) eastwards in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka in southern Asia, {{through all of}} coastal Southeast Asia including Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Indochina, the main and offshore islands of the Philippines, and southern China including Hong Kong, Hainan and Fuzhou, eastwards through New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, and Australia. In the northern Solomons it is restricted to Nissan Island, and replaced elsewhere by Sanford's sea eagle. In Victoria, where it is otherwise scarce, it is locally more common at Corner Inlet and Gippsland Lakes. Similarly in South Australia, it is most abundant along the north coast of Kangaroo Island. The range extends to the islands of Bass Strait and Tasmania, and it is thought able to move between the islands and the mainland. There is one unconfirmed record from Lord Howe Island and several from New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

25|$|Today the Leather Movement is {{generally}} {{seen as a}} part of the BDSM-culture instead of as a development deriving from gay subculture, even if a huge part of the BDSM-subculture was gay in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s the so-called New Guard leather subculture evolved.

25|$|High {{doses of}} potent estrogens such as {{diethylstilbestrol}} and ethinylestradiol {{were used in}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of breast cancer. Their effectiveness is approximately equivalent to that of antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. The use of high dose estrogen therapy in breast cancer has mostly been superseded by antiestrogen therapy due to the improved safety profile of the latter.|$|E

25|$|A {{primary care}} {{physician}} is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis.

In <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and still in the United Kingdom (and in many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is general practitioner.|$|E
25|$|As {{globalization}} {{has become more}} prevalent, international activity has also become an increasingly prominent element of comprehensive campaigns. In many ways, the building of international coalitions of trade unions, environmental groups, consumer federations and others has been an element of comprehensive campaigns since the mid-1980s. American labor unions had little occasion to engage in international activity in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2000s, international coalition-building—especially with unions in Western Europe (who represent workers at, and have strong working relationships with, the parent companies of American subsidiaries)—became far {{more important in the}} U.S.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make {{a significant contribution to}} our knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

25|$|Lead tetraoxide is {{most often}} used as a pigment for primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited. In the past, it was used in {{combination}} with linseed oil as a thick, long-lasting anti-corrosive paint. The combination of minium and linen fibres was also used for plumbing, now replaced with PTFE tape. Currently it is mostly used for manufacture of glass, especially lead crystal glass. It finds limited use in some amateur pyrotechnics as a delay charge and was used in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of dragon's egg pyrotechnic stars.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most rock guitarists, Buckingham {{does not}} {{play with a}} pick; instead, he picks the strings with his fingers and fingernails.

In 1979, he worked with Rick Turner, owner of Renaissance Guitars to create the Model One. He has used it {{extensively}} since, both with Fleetwood Mac and for his solo efforts. He uses a Taylor Guitar 814ce {{for most of his}} acoustic performances and has also used an Ovation Celebrity in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, he also extensively used the Fairlight CMI.|$|E
