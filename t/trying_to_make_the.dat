Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as a scarcity of high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the movie, Elsa throws a {{birthday}} for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> party perfect for her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which try to take the cake for themselves, and she nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains.|$|E

5|$|The rural {{nature of}} his new home in Iwama allowed Ueshiba to {{concentrate}} on the second great passion of his life: farming. He had been born into a farming family and spent much of his life cultivating the land, from his settlement days in Hokkaidō to his work in Ayabe <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Ōmoto-kyō compound self-sufficient. He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government's restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time when food shortages were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Type-0 {{has never}} {{received}} an official localization {{in its original}} form. During development, {{while it was still}} titled Agito XIII, Tabata said he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game appealing to North American players. Despite a localization being confirmed as in development in an official guidebook interview, the original version of Type-0 was not released in the west. In the wake of the game's release in Japan, 1UP.com and Joystiq speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the PlayStation Vita. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants deter many {{potential}} predators {{due to their}} sting. The blindsnake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens consumes the larvae and pupae of Myrmecia, while avoiding the potent sting of the adults, which it is vulnerable to. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) also eats the eggs and larvae. Nymphs of the assassin bug species Ptilocnemus lemur lure these ants to themselves by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> ant sting them, by waving its hind legs around to attract a potential prey item. Body remains of Myrmecia {{have been found in}} the stomach contents of the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). The Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), the black currawong (Strepera versicolor), and the white-winged chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) prey on these ants, but few are successfully taken.|$|E

The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests {{that they can make}} money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E
5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|Because Pride and Prejudice was {{a period}} drama, the design {{required}} more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements {{in line with the}} character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.|$|E

The Exner system remains very popular in the United States, while in Europe other methods sometimes dominate, such as that described in the textbook by Evald Bohm, which is closer to the original Rorschach system and rooted more deeply in the original psychoanalysis principles.|$|E
25|$|Strike bowling is {{the term}} usually applied to bowlers that are used mainly to get a batsman out at the {{possible}} expense of runs if the wicket-taking is unsuccessful. For fast bowlers, this can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> ball move through the air or off the pitch. More commonly however, aggressive bowling techniques can be combined with swing bowling and seam bowling techniques to create nigh-on unplayable balls {{in the hands of}} a bowler of any speed. The inswinging yorker is seen as particularly deadly.|$|E
25|$|Although the University {{was officially}} desegregated in summer 1963, full {{integration}} of the athletic teams did not occur at that time. By spring 1967, the athletic program was warned by the Office of Education {{that the lack of}} African Americans under athletic scholarship was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In February 1967, Dock Rone, an African American student enrolled at the University from Montgomery, met with coach Bryant about potentially <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> football team as a walk-on. At that time Bryant believed a non-scholarship, African American walk-on would help pave the way to complete {{integration of the}} football team.|$|E
