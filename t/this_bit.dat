5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
5|$|Dausprungas is not {{mentioned}} anywhere else. However, {{it is known}} that Mindaugas had two nephews, Tautvilas and Gedvydas, who waged a war against their uncle. Since historians do not have any data on other brothers of Mindaugas, it is generally assumed that the two were sons of Dausprungas. During the civil war of 1249–1252 Tautvilas and Gedvydas asked Daniel of Galicia, their brother-in-law, for help. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> of information indicates that they also had a sister. The sister was the second wife of Daniel and they did not have children. Dausprugas' wife must have been Duke of Samogitia Vykintas' sister since Vykintas was an uncle of Tautvilas and Gedvydas. It is believed that Gedvydas died in 1253 in a campaign against Bohemia, as it is the last message about him. Tautvilas was killed by his cousin Treniota in 1263. Some historians suggest that Tautvilas had a son, Constantine, who ruled Vitebsk, however others disagree and claim that his son might have been Aigust, who was sent by Novgorod to Pskov in 1271.|$|E

25|$|Two {{styles of}} auger bit are {{commonly}} used in hand braces: the Jennings or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. <b>This</b> <b>bit</b> has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up the shank of the bit, for waste removal.

25|$|From <b>this</b> <b>bit</b> vector viewpoint, a {{concrete}} Boolean algebra {{can be defined}} equivalently as a nonempty set of bit vectors all of the same length (more generally, indexed by the same set) and closed under the bit vector operations of bitwise ∧, ∨, and ¬, as in 1010∧0110 = 0010, 1010∨0110 = 1110, and ¬1010 = 0101, the bit vector realizations of intersection, union, and complement respectively.|$|E

25|$|Uncompressed digital {{component}} signals are transmitted. Data is encoded in NRZI format, and a linear feedback shift register {{is used to}} scramble the data to reduce the likelihood that long strings of zeroes or ones will be present on the interface. The interface is self-synchronizing and self-clocking. Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of ten ones followed by twenty zeroes (twenty ones followed by forty zeroes in HD); <b>this</b> <b>bit</b> pattern is not legal anywhere else within the data payload.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of The Lost Weekend in late 1945, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett began to {{collaborate}} on a film about the problems faced by American military personnel stationed in Europe following World War II. Wilder went to Europe to research the project, but his visits to the concentration camps so disturbed him he returned to Hollywood determined to write and direct a musical comedy instead. He had known Bing Crosby since the crooner's days with Paul Whiteman, and he and Brackett had contributed to Crosby's 1940 film Rhythm on the River. Since Crosby was Paramount's leading star and Wilder was the studio's top director, {{it was easy to}} convince executives to greenlight a collaboration between the two. Wilder recalled reading about a Danish inventor who had demonstrated a magnetic recording device for Franz Joseph I of Austria in the hope the Emperor would help finance his invention, and he and Brackett used <b>this</b> <b>bit</b> of historical fact as the starting point for their screenplay, which initially was titled Viennese Story.|$|E

After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D− lines and the aforementioned pull-up resistors hold it in the J (idle) state.

2500|$|In most camps, {{libraries}} {{were opened}} {{at the end of}} October 1915. The books were generally offered by prisoners’ aid committees. For example, in 1914, the camp at Münsigen received 220 books from the Stuttgart Red Cross. In 1915, the camp’s library featured 2,500 titles in French and a thousand in Russian. Most of the books were gathered by donations from the public and by 1918 they were dispatching 1,000 to 2,000 books every week to various camps. Newspapers were also highly valued as they could bring news from the outside and the discovery of the smallest sheet excited a prisoner’s eyes: “Read a fragment of a newspaper from Orléans [...] Finally <b>this</b> <b>bit</b> of paper did us some good, for we were sick of all these German victories that they never stopped talking about”. Then around January 1918, the CPWC (Central Prisoners of War Committee) started the monthly journal, The British Prisoner of War, which ran until end of the war. Sometimes, theatrical troupes and orchestras performed, while camp newspapers saw publication in places like Zwickau, Ohrdruf and Stendal.|$|E
