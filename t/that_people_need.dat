25|$|Even when {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} correctly applied, {{the results can}} be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical significance of a trend in the data—which measures {{the extent to which a}} trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.|$|E
25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to learn primary subject matter well before they can learn how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E

500|$|La Dulzura {{represented}} a stylistic departure for the group, both musically and lyrically. The song [...] "Del Tope al Fondo" [...] {{is influenced by}} Argentine music, especially the genre of tango. Lyrically, the band discusses more romantic themes {{as opposed to the}} political emphasis of the group's previous records. [...] Guitarist Eliut Gonzalez remarked that the band aimed to shift discussion to [...] "the good things in the world", explaining [...] that [...] "We know <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> help, and that behind every revolution or movement, there is love. We wanted to document that in our music, but without doing it in a cheesy or typical way." [...] The singles [...] "Baja la Tensión", [...] "La Complicidad", [...] "Para Estar" [...] and [...] "Ilegal" [...] all charted on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart. In 2011, the group collaborated with Dominican musician Vicente García on his single [...] "Mi Balcón".|$|E
500|$|Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. [...] In {{the notes}} {{of one of}} his {{students}} for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: [...] "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. [...] What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized." [...] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. [...] While Whitehead acknowledged that [...] "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles," [...] he argued <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. [...] For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.|$|E

The feminist academic and author Sally R. Munt argues that American Beauty uses its [...] "art house" [...] trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a [...] "cliché of bourgeois preoccupation; the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Principles (1973), R. M. Hare accepts {{that rule}} utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims {{that this is}} a result of {{allowing}} the rules to be [...] "as specific and un-general as we please." [...] He argues that {{one of the main reasons}} for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> for moral education and character development and he proposes that [...] "a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules, i.e., by increasing their generality."

He has been lauded as [...] "the funniest guy on Facebook". In September 2013, Takei used his Facebook page to defend Nina Davuluri, who was targeted by a backlash of racist and xenophobic comments after being named Miss America 2014. He later appeared in a joint ABC interview with Davuluri, in which she revealed that she is a Trekkie.

2500|$|Gee's {{current work}} in the field of new literacies has seen him shift in his {{research}} focus somewhat from studying language-in-use to examining the D/iscourses of a range of new social practices—with a particular emphasis on video games and learning. Gee applies many key concepts from his previous research to studying video games. For example, Gee continues to argue that if we take reading to mean gaining understanding (instead of simply decoding letter sounds and words), one {{needs to be able to}} recognize or produce meanings inherent to any one semiotic domain in order to be literate in that domain. As such, and as Gee sets out in his text What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, one can be literate in the semiotic domain of video games if he or she “can recognize (the equivalent of “reading”) and/or produce (the equivalent of “writing”) meanings” in the video game domain. Therefore, because new literacies are multiple and attached to social and cultural practices, Gee explains <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to (1) be literate in many different [...] semiotic domains, and (2) be able to become literate in other *new* semiotic domains throughout their lives. This theoretical orientation aligns with {{work in the}} broad field of [...] "new literacies" [...] research—by colleagues such as Colin Lankshear, Michele Knobel, Henry Jenkins, Kevin Leander, Rebecca Black, Kurt Squire, and Constance Steinkuehler, among others.|$|E

60|$|It may {{be asked}} here by some simple-minded reader why we should not resort to crude Communism as the disciples were told to do. This would be quite {{practicable}} in a village where production {{was limited to the}} supply of the primitive wants which nature imposes on all human beings alike. We know <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>need</b> bread and boots without waiting for them to come and ask for these things and offer to pay for them. But when civilization advances to the point at which articles are produced that no man absolutely needs and that only some men fancy or can use, it is necessary that individuals should be able to have things made to their order and at their own cost. It is safe to provide bread for everybody because everybody wants and eats bread; but it would be absurd to provide microscopes and trombones, pet snakes and polo mallets, alembics and test tubes for everybody, as nine-tenths of them would be wasted; and the nine-tenths of the population who do not use such things would object to their being provided at all. We have in the invaluable instrument called money a means of enabling every individual to order and pay for the particular things he desires over and above the things he must consume in order to remain alive, plus the things the State insists on his having and using whether he wants to or not; for example, clothes, sanitary arrangements, armies and navies. In large communities, where even the most eccentric demands for manufactured articles average themselves out until they can be foreseen within a negligible margin of error, direct communism (Take what you want without payment, as the people do in Morris's News From Nowhere) will, after a little experience, be found not only practicable but highly economical to an extent that now seems impossible. The sportsmen, the musicians, the physicists, the biologists will get their apparatus for the asking as easily as their bread, or, as at present, their paving, street lighting, and bridges; and the deaf man will not object to contribute to communal flutes when the musician has to contribute to communal ear trumpets. There are cases (for example, radium) in which the demand may be limited to the merest handful of laboratory workers, and in which nevertheless the whole community must pay because the price is beyond the means of any individual worker. But even when the utmost allowance is made for extensions of communism that now seem fabulous, there will still remain {{for a long time to}} come regions of supply and demand in which men will need and use money or individual credit, and for which, therefore, they must have individual incomes. Foreign travel is an obvious instance. We are so far from even national communism still, that we shall probably have considerable developments of local communism before it becomes possible for a Manchester man to go up to London for a day without taking any money with him. The modern practical form of the communism of Jesus is therefore, for the present, equal distribution of the surplus of the national income that is not absorbed by simple communism.|$|E
