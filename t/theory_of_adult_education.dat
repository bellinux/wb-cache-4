50|$|Alexander Kapp (1799-1869) was a German {{educator}} and editor, brother of Ernst Kapp. In 1833, originally introduced the term andragogy. Andragogy consists of learning strategies focused on adults. It is often {{interpreted as the}} process of engaging adult learners {{in the structure of}} the learning experience. Later, the term andragogy developed into a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> by the American educator, Malcolm Knowles. Kapp used andragogy to describe elements of Plato's education theory. Andragogy (andr- meaning 'man') could be contrasted with pedagogy (paid- meaning 'child' and agogos meaning 'leading') (see Davenport 1993: 114) Although Kapp's use of andragogy had some currency, it was disputed, and its use ground to a halt. In 1921, the term reappeared in a report by Rosenstock in which he argued that 'adult education required special teachers, methods and philosophy, and he used the term andragogy to refer collectively to these special requirements' (Nottingham Andragogy Group 1983: v).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} adult {{education}} in Britain, {{and other parts}} of the Western world, is undergoing a process of instrumentalisation which is detrimental to its identity and ethos. Opposition to this instrumentalisation requires the development of a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> which will protect its ethos and identity, and challenge the neo-liberal ideas of the policy-makers who are initiating this process. This theory must not only explain the role of adult education, by locating it in its historical, educational and social context, but also demonstrate its educational and social importance or intrinsic worth. This requires that the theory also satisfies the criteria of theoretical adequacy: the theory must demonstrate explanatory power and reach. An examination of the main traditions of adult education theory in Britain shows that these traditions do not meet these conditions. This thesis argues that Habermas' theory of communicative action can provide the basis for the required <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> This is demonstrated through a dialogical, methodological approach to the research which reflects Habermas' method in constructing his theory. This approach takes three forms. The detailed, critical study of the Habermasian oeuvre identifies those themes important and relevant to a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> and highlights their major strengths and weaknesses. A representative overview of the main critiques of these thematic areas is integrated into this critical study to enable further assessment of the validity of Habermas' theory. This assessment affirms the theoretical adequacy of Habermas' communicative project, but also identifies problematic areas which need further investigation or development if that adequacy is to be strengthened. The thesis then examines the extent to which adult education theorists recognise the possibilities of an Habermasian-informed adult education theory. This examination demonstrates that the overall level of understanding and familiarity with the Habermasian oeuvre, and its important, relevant themes, is not sufficient to satisfy the theoretical conditions identified above. The thesis concludes by drawing from Habermas' work, and from the more relevant interpretations of adult educators and educators, to present a Habermasian-informed adult educational theory which does satisfy these conditions, and thus could provide an effective challenge to the neo-liberal instrumentalisation of adult education currently taking place...|$|E

This {{research}} report focuses on increasing {{the effectiveness of}} the transformational leadership abilities of seven managers at Retek, a pharmaceutical retail organisation, by specifically using transformational teaching and learning strategies in a Management Development Programme. The study is framed by the <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> including transformational teaching and learning as well as transformational leadership. I used a focus group interview to collect the data and analysed it by using content, descriptive and narrative analysis.

The themes explored the Retek environment, the Management Development Programme (MDP), transformational learning and teaching strategies and transformational leadership. The results of this study indicated that transformational leadership could be developed and improved by using a training programme in which the content was relevant and applicable to retail managers’ leadership and management practice by using transformational teaching and learning strategies. It highlighted the benefits of attending a MDP to enhance personal and professional development.

40|$|Online education, {{supported}} by online {{resources such as}} e-mail, chat rooms, and Web-based instruction, is a rapidly growing area of tertiary/higher education that has been facilitated by increased usage of home computers and advances {{in the development of}} user-friendly interfaces (Christensen, Anakwe, and Kessler 2001). A range of positive outcomes has accompanied the growth of online education, including opportunities to support greater flexibility in the delivery of educational services, allowing students to choose the time and place of educational experiences (Huang 2002; Hewitt 2003); {{an increase in the number}} of nontraditional students who may be older than traditional students, employed full-time, or geographically isolated (Christensen, Anakwe, and Kessler 2001); and the chance to utilize the vast resources of information available via the Internet.

The target group in the case study is women. These women live in townships and informal settlements in Cape Town and {{are part of a}} community-based network called The Women's Circle (TWC). The purpose of this study,is to advance understandings or bring out contradictions in current theoretical debates in relation to health and human rights. Primarily the study aims: II To generate knowledge which could assist in strengthening the TWC women's capacities to invoke their rights to health, access health and healthcare and improve the quality of their lives; * To identify whether the different <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> can inform the work of the University of Cape Town (UCT) Health and Human Rights Unit, which is currently developing learning programmes around the right to health for civil society organisations; and * To gather empirical evidence to assist TWC in strengthening partnerships with the state and lobbying government around ensuring access to health rights and services. This study is inter-disciplinary and links <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> to health and human rights. Therefore the literature review draws on work of authors within the following domains: Nefdt (2003) in social services; Sen (1990) in development; London (2004); Ngwenya (2000) and Mann, Gruskin, Grodin and Annas (1999) in health and human rights.

40|$|Ongoing {{training}} of serving {{officers in the}} Police Service of England and Wales is an important function of the organisation. It is necessary to maintain competence of officers and prevent failures of the organisation for which it could be liable. The Theory of Andragogy is the major <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> and its principles include that organisations should encourage individual self-motivation to promote effective learning. This thesis {{was intended to be}} a mixed methods empirical study combining a staff attitude survey and focus group data to examine the extent police ongoing training fulfils this principle. However due to participation issues the qualitative phase was unable to provide firm conclusions, but does provide us with potential hypotheses for further research. The survey suggests that current training provision does not appear to take the andragogical principle of self-motivation into account and this is detrimental to the effectiveness of the training. Whilst we can show that making training mandatory does not promote (and may undermine self-motivation), there may also be other factors involved. The research also suggests that this deficiency is exacerbated by the predominance of e-learning courses. Suggestions to improve motivation to train by embracing andragogical principles are made...|$|E
40|$|The Chautauqua Assembly was {{distinguished}} {{not only}} for its contribution to adult education programs but also for its contribution to educational thought: learning should be lifelong. The Chautauqua founders regarded education for adults as both a right and duty. This belief derived from three sources: (1) a religious basis, (2) a theory of self-culture, and (3) the right of each per-son to have access to knowledge. To this ideological bases was coupled a theory of adult educa-tion, namely, adulthood is a unique time for learning. Among the elements of this <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> were these: (1) adults can learn, (2) education should be extended beyond formal school years, (3) life is a school, (4) agencies should cooperate in promoting adult learning, and (5) education should bring adults into contact with current thought on scientific and social issues. This article concludes that Chautauqua, more than many of the other popular education move-ments for adults between 1865 and 1914, addressed concerns that have proved relevant to the adult education movement for nearly an entire century. The Chautauqua movement was one of the several movements for the pop-ular education of adults that appeared in the decades between the end of th...|$|E
40|$|The article {{contains}} {{an overview of}} studies and concepts of adult education in Germany from the 1960 s, when andragogy was formed as a discipline of science at universities, to the present. Of particular importance {{for the development of}} research on education in Germany, were four large-scale empirical team studies, commonly known as: Göttingen Study (1966), Oldenburg Study (1971 - 1973), Hanover College (1975), and Heidelberg Study (1979 - 1981), which were more closely characterised in the article from the methodological and theoretical perspective. In Germany in the 1980 s, there was a clear turn in the methodology of andragogy research towards a paradigm of quantitative studies. The turn allowed to include and give a specific trait to concepts of life environment, everyday knowledge, patterns of interaction and biographicity. In the 1990 s, in the German andragogy disappeared a tendency for the dominance of a selected research paradigm; a methodological concept of criss-crossing perspectives was developed, which implies the development of specific research methods, adequate for the subject of studies. Further in the text were presented concepts of adult learning emerging in the next decades. They were: key qualifications, exemplary, expansive, situational, self-organised, and directed learning as well as theories of emotional lifelong adult learning.

The goal of this mixed methods sequential exploratory study was to examine attitudes of middle grades educators toward an online professional development course held for teachers employed by one suburban school district in the southeast region of the United States. The theoretical framework is Knowles 2 ̆ 7 s <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> (andragogy). The research questions addressed perceptions of connectedness and learning in an online professional development course. A structured interview protocol was used to collect qualitative data from 5 participants; data were coded and analyzed into 6 typologies. The Classroom Community Scale (CCS) that assessed perceptions of (a) connectedness and (b) learning effectiveness among 23 participants provided quantitative data to complement the interview findings. Mean ranks were used to prioritize 10 items within each of the 2 CCS subscales. Overall, participants felt like they could rely on others in the course yet were uncertain that others could depend on them. The study also identified a preference for immediate feedback and activities that required collaboration. These findings can be used to inform the design of online professional development courses for K- 12 educators.

40|$|Abstract: Transformative {{learning}} is a major <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> that can help us consider {{ways in which the}} study of intercultural communication is particularly suited to stimulating personal change. Intercultural communication studies offer continuous opportunities for students to learn new ways of making meaning, both subjective and objective, and transforming what Mezirow (1991) terms their meaning perspectives. The holistic pedagogical approach to intercultural education described here emphasizes reflection and self-reflexivity and bodymindfulness in order to promote integrative development of students as whole people, not just to focus on their intellectural growth. It is intended to help them to cultivate both their rational and extrarational capabilities and to exercise appropriate self-care during the process of writing their theses. If they can learn to welcome confusion as a transitory state between prior convictions and new meaning perspectives, {{they are more likely to}} experience transformative learning and new ways of being. As the reflective passages written by students in final papers suggest, they have responded to this holistic educational opportunity with enhanced self-awareness, new skills, and the recognition that they need to make the intention to continue learning throughout their lives. Putting Ourselves on Edge Writing a dissertation has been provocatively described as a liminal journey of the self (Deegan & Hill, 1991). The use of liminal here refers to desires or needs that are smoldering below the threshold of awareness and may be barely perceptible to us. Deegan and Hill describe the liminal self as transitional.

The American {{health care system}} is in need of enhancement to better serve the healthcare needs of all people so {{there has never been a}} greater opportunity for NP entrepreneurial thinking and implementation of new initiatives (Marshall, 2011). Information regarding NP-led clinics is limited and NPs need to be educated on elements of successful independent healthcare ventures. The purpose of this project was to enhance interest and knowledge of starting a NP-led clinic. A review of the literature demonstrated that entrepreneurial opportunities abound in areas that have not yet been imagined for experts in advanced practice roles. Independent practice opportunities allow NP entrepreneurs to pursue their own personal vision and desire to improve healthcare outcomes using innovative approaches. Knowledgeable NPs are needed to initiate and lead the introduction of change. Education about entrepreneurship and source of NP-led clinics is an important issue for NPs and health care consumers (Boore 2 ̆ 6 Porter, 2012).

40|$|To {{understand}} the Australian Breastfeeding Association’s approach to adult {{education and the}} educational practices it introduced into maternal education in Australia in the period 1964 - 2009, {{it is useful to}} consider adult education generally and maternal education specifically during the twentieth century. Most of what passes for education of mothers is informal adult education. One view is that mothers require expert instruction and supervision with regulation of feeding to ensure their babies survive. The opposite view is that mothers should receive no formal instruction at all about being mothers: breastfeeding and caring for babies are, in this view, instinctive activities. However, the Association’s approach has featured autonomous learners with volunteer facilitators in informal settings. One theory that assists particularly in understanding the educational model used by the Association is the humanistic <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Another theory relevant to maternal education is a heutagogical approach to adult education, advocated by radical adult education theorists. To {{understand the}} Association’s educational approach, it is necessary to establish the core principles of the education provided to mothers by the Association. The archival research has demonstrated an understanding of the Association’s approach to maternal education. The primary feature of the approach is mother to mother learning. The findings of this paper will increase knowledge of how adults are educated and contribute to understanding of adult education, particularly maternal education. There will be implications for education of mothers and perhaps of women generally which will be of interest to those involved in adult education...|$|E
40|$|This interactionist study {{follows a}} group of adults, who, after a break in their formal education, return to study in an {{institution}} of public sector higher education. It {{is based on a}} series of interviews, before and {{during the first year of}} their courses to examine their subjective interpretations of the reality of the return to study in comparison with what they expected it would be like. The increasing numbers of adults returning to higher education through a variety of access courses would seem to make this an opportune time to examine such experiences. However, this research raises questions about why this should be the case and examines answers at the level of the institution and the individuals themselves. It addresses the claims that the reasons for the increase are based on ideological assumptions in line with social justice but the reality which meets this group questions whether in fact provision and practice is in line with philosophy and purpose. By allowing {{a group of}} mature students to speak for themselves it questions the assumptions of those who would advocate a separate <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Such humanistic beliefs may be within the perception of the educators but be beyond the reality or requirements of men and women who must fit their studies into already busy lives and who may thus have an instrumental approach to education. To suggest it should be otherwise is ethnocentric. This study seeks to examine whether or not one particular polytechnic takes cognisance of the needs of adults to meet the aims it claims to hold at an ideological level. At the same time, however, it asks about the relevance of humanistic approaches considering the conflicting demands of accountability within the changing status of public sector higher education corporations...|$|E
40|$|Learning is an {{investment}} in capacity building that has {{and will continue to}} reap rewards for primary producers and government in terms of increased sustainable production, profitability, exports, jobs and sustainable rural communities. Primary production operates in a context of continual change and requires up to date, complex and varied skills of primary producers and land managers. A recent national research project funded by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Australia confirmed that application of best practice from the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> in designing and developing learning programs in primary industry results in learning activities that provide information that is relevant to farmers’ needs, delivered in an entertaining way, and that draws on examples directly relevant to the participants. As a result, the training often exceeds the expectations of the participants. The project produced a self-assessment checklist to identify ways of improving the development and delivery of training for extension practitioners and training providers. The key issues include continuous monitoring of client’s needs, and actively seeking opportunities to meet and work with industry organisations, other training providers and funding bodies. There appear to be two drivers for the development of learning programs. One is problems or opportunities identified by people and organisations that could be termed ‘scanners’ and who tend not to be potential participants, the other is learning needs expressed by individuals or enterprises who want to participate in learning activities (participants). Scanners are typically industry organisations, government agencies and researchers, but may include providers and participants. Extension practitioners are well-placed to act as scanners. It is very important that farmers and farmer organisations {{contribute to the development of}} new learning programs. Without industry input and support, extension practitioners and training providers cannot be expected to ensure they meet client needs. In other words, to develop effective learning programs, there must an industry learning community of producers, industry organisations, extension practitioners and training providers and other stakeholders such as supply chain enterprises, government and researchers. <br /...|$|E

While <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> has drawn broadly on disciplines {{in the social sciences}} to help develop its own distinctive and varied theories and practices, anthropology, particularly paleoanthropology – the study of the evolution and development of human beings – has remained largely out of its field of view. Certainly, up until rather recently, anthropology offered rather few obvious connection points to <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Other than its important contribution of ethnographic research methodologies (Malinowski, 1922; Radcliffe-Brown, 1933; Risjord, 2000) that are sometimes adopted in <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> research (Taylor, Beck &Ainsworth, 2001), anthropology’s exploration of culture – dominated by discussions of kinship networks, descriptions of cultural artifacts, and depictions of primitive economies – seemed only weakly connected to adult education’s interest in the effective engagement <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> learners.

It is initiated to reduce poverty and bring development in the country. The basic underpinning principle of this program is that, if the productivity of the farmer is increased, on the one hand it is possible to bring sustainable development in Ethiopia {{and on the other hand}} it will help to get the raw material for the industry and reduce the migration of the work force from rural to urban areas. Agriculture is the source of livelihood for over 80 % of the population and the majority of the poor live in rural areas. About 59. 5 % of the population is illiterate. The government gives overriding primacy to the welfare of rural populace. Agriculture is also believed to be a potential source to generate primary surplus to fuel the growth of other sectors ofthe economy. The main feature of the target group is that majority of them are illiterate and their mode of production is subsistence. Of the many kinds of intervention to bring development; educating the society is the major one. Indeed the government offers training to the subsistence farmers with the intention of enhancing their productivity via development agents. DAs are there to facilitate empowerment of the farmers, lead the process of technology transfer and change the attitude of farmers. DAs work with subsistence farmers to introduce the modern system of farm and farm related activities. To do so a series ofteaching - learning processes are evident in the program. The purpose of the study is to see the kind of teaching - learning processes that are evident in the program and to see how the principles and <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> relate to the program. Thus, the research tries to explore the learning approaches and practices evident in the extension package program, the perception of DAs and farmers about the training and the actual and potential role of literacy in an {{agricultural extension}} program. The research adopts an interpretivist paradigm and some aspects of critical paradigm to understand the data and the context. It is qualitative in nature. The study is conducted on a sample of 18 participants (15 farmers and 3 extension package workers). Semi structured interviews were conducted with three DAs, focus group discussions with twelve farmers, observation while the training was taking place in the field and document analysis to get factual information. The research results are reported in the form of discussion and findings. Indeed it is revealed that farmers are divided into two as the leader and follower farmers. Accordingly the types of trainings are divided into two as general and special training. Literacy ability ofthe farmers is one ofthe criteria to be eligible for special training. That resulted in the exclusion ofthe majority of farmers from the special training program.

40|$|Is {{the word}} &dquo;andragogy&dquo; simply a trendy {{neologism}} devoid of sig-nificance {{or is the}} term pregnant with a possible new <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> practice for <b>adult</b> <b>education?</b> Does the distinction between pedagogy and andra-gogy represent a mere word game, a fruitless semantic joust, a futile exercise in the fabrication of jargon? Or does the distinction between pedagogy and andragogy provide {{a point of departure}} for clarifying and amplifying the complex concept of &dquo;adult education?&dquo; The lines have been fairly well delineated between those who see promise in the concept of andragogy and those who view the concept as a venture in sloganeering. Houle (3 : 5) states what I call the classical position very succinctly. Some believe that &dquo;education is fundamentally the same wherever and whenever it occurs. They assert that it deals always with such basic concerns as the nature of the learner, the goals sought [...] &dquo; It is argued, Houle continues, that &dquo;the essentials of the educative process remain th...|$|R
