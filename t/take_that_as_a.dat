Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, {{it is likely that}} Feller would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts. Feller said [...] "I know in my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400than 300if I hadn't spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> complaint.

500|$|Former Major League Baseball player Wes Parker almost {{literally}} {{walked into}} his role. He was doing play-by-play reporting for a Los Angeles television station owned by Lear's partner, Jerry Perenchio. [...] "Lear casually asked if I'd {{be interested in the}} part. I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show. I read for the part, got it and didn't sleep at all that night." [...] Linda Gray was somewhat non-plussed upon being offered the role of transgender Linda Murkland. [...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production. Lois Nettleton reportedly based her characterization of Christina Stockwood on Clark Gable. Production started in early March 1977 with director Herbert Kenwith.|$|E
40|$|Allegory has an old usage in Persian {{poetry and}} {{it is one of the}} {{features}} of Indian style. Rhetoricians from past until today have had different ideas about its definition and types. One group <b>took</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of simile or metaphor and others <b>took</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> figurative device and took the idioms as allegory too. This article tries to introduce and criticize different viewpoints and descriptions and present a distinctive description of allegory and introduce all kinds of that and make it notable that allegory is a kind of simile and thus it is an image and should be considered in imagery...|$|R

Wal-Mart {{is the largest}} DVD retailer in the United States, and its decision prompted the New York Times to run a mock obituary for the HD DVD format. The newspaper quoted technology analyst Rob Enderle's contention that if Wal-Mart [...] "says HD DVD is done, you can <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fact." [...] Four days earlier, Best Buy began recommending Blu-ray Disc as the customer's digital format choice, and Netflix, the largest online video rental service, began phasing out its HD DVD inventory after stocking both formats since early 2006. In January 2008, UK retailer Woolworths Group plc said it would stock only Blu-ray discs in its 820 stores beginning in March 2008.|$|E

Derren Brown and Stephen Fry used Twitter to front an online {{campaign against the}} Daily Mail and Jan Moir throughout the afternoon and a Facebook page was set up urging followers to complain to the brands whose advertisements featured alongside the article. Fry wrote, [...] "I gather a repulsive nobody writing in a paper no one of any decency would be seen dead with has written something loathesome and inhumane". Brown wrote, [...] "If Gateley's [...] passing causes today's kind of gutter-journalism to be held to account, we can perhaps <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tribute".

Details of companies with advertisements on the same web page as Moir's article were posted on a specially established Facebook page named [...] "The Daily Mail should retract Jan Moir's hateful, homophobic article". According to The Guardian details about where Moir lived were posted on the Internet and a false rumour that the Daily Mail had reported Cowles as Gately's murderer was repeated on Twitter.|$|E

The colonels were not willing to share power, whereas the young king, like his father before him, was used to playing {{an active role in}} politics and would never consent to being a mere figurehead, especially in a military administration. Although the colonels' strong anti-communist, pro-NATO, and pro-Western views appealed to the United States, President Lyndon B. Johnson — in an attempt to avoid an international backlash — told Constantine that {{it would be best to}} replace the junta with a new government according to Paul Ioannidis in his book Destiny Prevails: My life with Aristóteles Onassis.

It would've been the wise thing to do. In my own defence however, I could point out that I didn't have a lot of options as to where I could turn. The President of the United States, among others, was pissed-off with me. And I had promised myself that I would make the best of this new situation in a new country.

40|$|Abstract: In this {{farewell}} {{lecture on}} the occasion of his departure as Professor of Development in sub-Saharan Africa at Leiden University and Director of the African Studies Centre (ASC), Leiden, the author starts with the vuvuzela issue <b>as</b> <b>an</b> illustration of the lack of confidence the world has in South Africa organizing and running the World Cup smoothly. He <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign <b>that</b> there still exists a stereotype of African incompetence, despite the social and economic progress Africa has witnessed in the last decade. He does not want to argue that African Studies {{have not been able to}} offset such a stereotype. What he tries to show is that it is not clear from the wealth of actor-oriented research in African Studies what the main social, political and economic trends in Africa are. He argues that actor-oriented research in African Studies should try to increase its relevance by contributing—through meta-analyses and comparative research—to the discussion on social, political and economic trends in Africa. Special attention should be paid to the possible rise of the developmental state in Africa. In doing so, African Studies may also substantiate its claim that it is able to challenge the universal pretensions of mainstream social science...|$|R

30|$|Importantly, we {{also need}} to make a {{connection}} with the US American anthropological linguistic tradition, as Michael Halliday has done — and let me <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aside, a footnote, to Saussure. When people say he is the founder of modern linguistics, I say, yes, well, but, by which I mean it’s important not to undervalue descriptive work, in thinking about what got linguistics in the 20 th century energized. After his earlier work in historical linguistics, Saussure didn’t do much by way of description, but in the USA, they did — Franz Boas and Sapir and others. I would give them equal weight actually in energizing linguistics in the 20 th century. To those who keep celebrating only Saussure as the founder of modern linguistics, I would say: read Boas’s work on Kwakiutl, and consider his collaboration and co-authoring with a speaker of the language, George Hunt. Boas made much more of an institutional contribution than Saussure; they were born within two years of each other, but Boas had the fortune of living until 1942, and was able to train a couple of generations of anthropologists and anthropological linguists. That of course was important, the flow of American anthropological descriptive linguistics into Michael Halliday’s thinking.|$|R
