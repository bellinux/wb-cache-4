After the overhaul, she arrived in Leyte Gulf to escort reinforcement and supply transports and convoys. She dealt with daily air attacks, as the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the liberation of the Philippines. She departed Leyte Gulf on 2 December to the Palaus, where she later joined a Mindoro-bound convoy. She provided anti-aircraft fire for the convoy and provided cover fire for invading forces. She provided cover for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before retiring to the Palaus.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} {{a plethora of}} songs {{during and after the}} By the Way tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with Joe Lally of Fugazi and Josh Klinghoffer, called Ataxia. The group was together for about two weeks, during which they recorded about ninety minutes of material. After two days in the recording studio, they played two shows at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, and spent <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> in the studio before disbanding.

5|$|The {{cease-fire}} {{went into}} effect on 22 February 1973. Not all of the fighting, however, had ended. This was particularly true around the town of Paksong, the last Royal Laotian stronghold on the Bolovens Plateau – the strategic high ground overlooking the Mekong River. At the request of Souvanna, nine B-52s and 12 U.S tactical fighters struck {{the outskirts of the}} town on 24 February. By mid-month, the bombers had flown 1,417 sorties and struck 286 targets in northern Laos. Once again acceding to a request from Souvanna, B-52s returned for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> of bombing on 16 and 17 April, dropping ordnance in support of government forces under attack around Ban Tha Vieng on the Plain of Jars.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Keith was the {{eleventh}} Atlantic tropical cyclone of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. It struck the Continental United States {{later in the}} calendar year than any since the 1925 Atlantic hurricane season. Keith developed out of a tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea on November17. It tracked northwestward, and under generally favorable conditions, it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) shortly before striking the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula. It turned northeastward in the Gulf of Mexico, and made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, on November23. Keith accelerated its forward motion {{under the influence of}} a cold front, and became extratropical near Bermuda on November24. The extratropical remnant persisted for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize the bulk of his armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the JTWC {{assessed}} Wukong {{to have reached}} its initial peak intensity with winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds). The next day, the storm began to accelerate due to an interaction with the nearby Tropical Storm Sonamu. Wukong absorbed the weakening Sonamu {{later in the day}} before turning towards the west. On August16, the storm turned towards the northwest due to a weakness in the ridge near Japan. Wukong made landfall late on August17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū. As the storm made landfall, the JTWC assessed Wukong to have winds of 100km/h (65mph 1-minute winds). The cyclone slowly traveled across land, entering the Sea of Japan about 24hours after landfall. Several hours after entering the Sea of Japan, the JMA downgraded Wukong to a tropical depression. The depression persisted for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before dissipating near the Russian coastline.|$|E
5|$|During the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, the Duke of Monmouth {{was welcomed}} {{when he passed}} through Shepton Mallet, staying in Longbridge House in Cowl Street {{on the night of}} 23 June, with his men {{quartered}} throughout the town, before setting out for Bristol the following day. Many Shepton men joined the cause, but Monmouth failed to take Bath or Bristol and had to return to Shepton on 30 June. Following the Battle of Sedgemoor, the Duke fled and spent the night of 6 July at Downside, a mile north of Shepton, before continuing his flight for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> before his capture.

5|$|Fighting raged {{throughout}} {{the early morning}} as 'B' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were able to break contact and fall back. 'D' Company, {{along with those of}} 'B' Company that were still isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Norbert {{marked the}} first time a core of a {{hurricane}} was fully mapped in three-dimensions. First forming on September 14, 1984 west of the Mexican coast, Norbert gradually intensified, reaching hurricane intensity two days after formation. On September 22, Norbert peaked in strength as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. While intensifying, Norbert meandered. It moved east, then north, then west, then south, then back towards the east, and finally towards the northeast. After fluctuating in intensity for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> Norbert rapidly weakened. It turned towards the northwest and made landfall in southern Baja California Norte as a tropical storm. The combination of Norbert and several other storms left thousands homeless throughout Mexico. The remnants of Hurricane Norbert produced moderate rain over Arizona.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July, Arkansas {{departed}} Northern Ireland for the Mediterranean Sea; {{she reached}} Oran, Algeria, on 10 July, before proceeding on to Taranto, arriving on 21 July. There, {{she joined the}} support force for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. Again, the battleship provided gunfire support to the amphibious invasion along with six Allied cruisers, starting on 15 August. The bombardment lasted for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days,</b> after which she withdrew, first to Palermo, and then to Oran. Arkansas {{then returned to the}} United States, arriving in Boston, on 14 September, where she underwent another refit that lasted until early November. She then steamed to California, via the Panama Canal, and {{spent the rest of the}} year conducting training maneuvers. On 20 January 1945, Arkansas departed California for Pearl Harbor, and then proceeded to Ulithi, to join the fleet in preparation for the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima. There, she was assigned to Task Force 54, which included five other battleships, four cruisers, and sixteen destroyers.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Olga {{were from the}} {{interaction}} of a cold front and a small weather disturbance in the north Atlantic Ocean, producing an extratropical low east of Bermuda on November22; five other tropical cyclones and gales formed {{earlier in the season}} in the same manner. The low gradually intensified, developing an area of convection east of the center and producing a large area of gale force winds. By 0000UTC on November24, the system organized enough to be classified as Subtropical Storm Two, while located about 900mi (1450km) east-southeast of Bermuda. Subsequently, the convection markedly increased and became more concentrated, with hints of an eye feature. Within 12hours of becoming a subtropical, it is estimated the cyclone transitioned into Tropical Storm Olga; however, it was not purely tropical, due to being positioned beneath an upper-level low. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not initiate advisories until nine hours later, referring it as Subtropical Storm Two for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} filmed {{extensively}} in Atlanta in March 2015, with <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> of filming in New York City.

Production began in late July 2015 and ended in mid-May, 2016. Scenes of the Quantico Academy were shot at {{the campus of the}} Université de Sherbrooke, which stood in for the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, where the show is based. The series was shot both in studio at Mel’s Cité du Cinéma and on location. Colleen Sharp, Nicholas Erasmus, Terilyn A. Shropshire and Lori Ball were the editors for multiple episodes. Allyson C Johnson and Vanessa Procopio edited one episode each. The Director of Photography was Anthony Wolberg, who has provided cinematography for the maximum episodes. Other cinematographers include Anastas N. Michos and Todd McMullen. Joel J. Richard provided the music.|$|E
5|$|After the 1897 {{baseball}} season, {{he returned}} to his home in Portland, Oregon with his health deteriorating. In December, Parrott traveled to New Mexico in hopes of re-gaining his health. When in New Mexico, he reported that the weather was too cold and that he was planning to move to Arizona where the climate is more mild. On April 14, 1898, while in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Parrott died of tuberculosis. Earlier that day, Parrott had telegraphed his father, Thomas H. Parrott, back in Portland alerting him that it was not likely he would live <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days.</b> Upon receiving the telegram, Thomas H. Parrott sent his son, Archie Parrott, on a train to Arizona to be with the dying Jiggs Parrott. However, after the train left the station in Portland, the Parrott family got word that Jiggs Parrott had died. Archie Parrott continued to Arizona to retrieve his brother's remains. His remains were returned on April 23. Parrott's funeral was held on April 25, at his home in East Portland. His pall-bearers were several former teammates from the Portland Willamettes: Joseph Beveridge, Charles Neale, Frank Buchtel, William Kern, Fred Bailey, and John Rankin. According to The Oregonian hundreds attended his funeral and 500 people attended his burial at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland.|$|E

5|$|The protests {{involved}} over 2,500 {{people and}} among those present were incumbent parish priest John Barboza, Valerian Fernandes, Ajekar parish priest Valerian Fernandes, Attur parish priest Arthur Pereira, Miyar parish priest Ronald Miranda, Paschal Menezes, Parappady parish priest Alex Aranha, Michael D'Silva, Hirgan parish priest Michael Lobo, Kanajar parish priest Alwyn D'Cunha {{and many other}} priests and nuns in the area. The Christian protestors also clashed with police at St. Sebastian Church in the Permannur area of Ullal {{on the outskirts of}} Mangalore, shouting slogans and throwing stones at the police for their failure to arrest the perpetrators of the attacks. The police arrested several Christians after firing into the air and being involved in a lathi charge. A witness in Permannur claimed that Christians attacked the houses of Hindus in retaliation, shouting slogans against the BJP government. Four people of pro-Hindu organisations were reportedly injured at Kalladka and Attavar {{on the outskirts of the}} Mangalore when their vehicles were attacked and were pelted with stones. Ten people, including one of the Sri Ram Sena activists, were reportedly stabbed during the protests and according to the police, the situation was used by some to settle personal scores and not all stabbing incidents were related to attack on churches and the subsequent violence in the city. The Sri Ram Sena protested against the stabbing of one of their activists by organising a shutdown of educational institutions and shops. The district administration responded by declaring a holiday for all educational institutions in Mangalore taluk, and extended prohibitory orders under the Section 144 Criminal Procedure Code for <b>two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> in the wake of the attacks and protests as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Their morale {{boosted by}} this small victory, the Greeks moved forward, still {{remaining}} on higher ground, {{to a new}} position more suited for encampment and better watered. The Spartans and Tegeans were on a ridge {{to the right of}} the line, the Athenians on a hillock on the left and the other contingents on the slightly lower ground between. In response, Mardonius brought his men up to the Asopus and arrayed them for battle; However, neither the Persians nor the Greeks would attack; Herodotus claims this is because both sides received bad omens during sacrificial rituals. The armies thus stayed camped in their locations for eight days, during which new Greek troops arrived. Mardonius then sought to break the stalemate by sending his cavalry to attack the passes of Mount Cithaeron; this raid resulted in the capture of a convoy of provisions intended for the Greeks. <b>Two</b> <b>more</b> <b>days</b> passed, during which time the supply lines of the Greeks continued to be menaced. Mardonius then launched another cavalry raid on the Greek lines, which succeeded in blocking the Gargaphian Spring, which had been the only source of water for the Greek army (they could not use the Asopus due to the threat posed by Persian archers). Coupled with the lack of food, the restriction of the water supply made the Greek position untenable, so they decided to retreat to a position in front of Plataea, from where they could guard the passes and have access to fresh water. To prevent the Persian cavalry from attacking during the retreat, it was to be performed that night.|$|E
