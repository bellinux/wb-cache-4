25|$|Despite losing three {{starters}} {{from the}} previous era's squad, the Rebels started off strong once again for their 2009–10 campaign with their second consecutive 5–0 start, {{the first time since}} 1989–90 and 1990–91 <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. Their victory over #16 Louisville was their first home victory against a ranked opponent since 2007 and the highest ranked opponent the Rebels have beaten since defeating the Wisconsin Badgers (ranked 6th in the final AP Poll) in 2007. On November 30, 2009, the Rebels were ranked 24th in the AP Polls and 21st in the USA Today/ESPN Polls, making it the first time the team was ranked since 2007. However, UNLV soon dropped out of the AP Top 25 with losses to Kansas State and USC. In early February, however, UNLV upset a No. 14 and Jimmer Fredette–lead BYU team. As a result, UNLV returned to the national rankings, but after losing their next three, they soon dropped out, though they recovered {{at the end of the}} season, and finished 11–5 in MWC play. On March 6, 2010, they ended their 2009–10 campaign with 74–56 win over Wyoming at home. They finished the season 23–7, their best win–loss season since 2007. Despite losing in the finals of the Mountain West tournament the following weekend, UNLV did manage to defeat BYU for the fifth time in six matchups. On March 14, 2010, the Runnin' Rebels returned to the NCAA Tournament after missing out in 2009. They finished the season with a 25–9 record, losing in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Northern Iowa 66–69, thanks to a 3–pointer with under 3 seconds to go by the Panthers.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 11 reviews. NME Lucy O'Brien commended Usher for producing a more mature album, that [...] "reflects his emotional experience" [...] writing [...] "Versatility {{is the key}} here: staccato beats with mellifluous melody, rich slow-jams and edgy harmonies – but woven through with Usher's own perspective. A winner." [...] BBC Online's Christian Hopwood also favoured the album, commenting on how Usher has developed [...] "his producing, singing and song writing skills to a new level" [...] noting his contribution to twelve of the seventeen tracks. Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music declared the album an improvement [...] "over Usher's [...] "old" [...] new album"—All About You—and depicted it as his best work to-date. Leroy credited the production groups The Neptunes and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, depicting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> [...] "some of their best work" [...] on the album. J. D. Considine of Blender commented that the album [...] "does what it's supposed to, giving Usher a grown-up R sound without reducing his boyish charm". Kathryn McGuire of Rolling Stone described Usher's vocals as [...] "velvety" [...] and further wrote that [...] "Amid all the playboy pouting and preening, Usher's vocals are impressively adaptable [...] McGuire noted the album's primary fault is that [...] "Usher never surrenders his meticulously groomed veneer", with every track being formulaic, or [...] "radio-safe".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} a great {{humanitarian}} action was performed by squad chief Lieutenant Colonel Ushakov, which received from you praiseworthy and commendable words: not entering you in battle because of my injured soldiers, I left for Arkevan and Lankaran through a woody road, wanting to save them from captivity and followed the convoy which was accompanied by unarmed injured soldiers and Russian refugees, totalling 350 people, of whom 260 were injured soldiers, 40 caretakers of the horses, and 50 Russian fugitive soldiers. Having reached all {{of them on the}} road, the battalion led by Ushakov captured only the Russian fugitives, while the other 300 peoples were brutally executed, leaving no single one of them alive, as they were Muslims, despite the fact that all of them were basically walking dead, being injured and unarmed. Is this meant to the people you say you love? Where is your God [...] — Jesus, saying [...] "Love your neighbor as you love yourself, and the raised sword will perish by the sword." [...] Where does it say that we should kill prisoners, and even the sick and injured? Of this atrocity, ferocity, and brutality, are only our soldiers capable of. Based on your Gospel's saying [...] "the raised sword will perish by the sword". — I confidently predict, and foretell that is there is something good for Persia, when your soldiers, will rebel against their rulers themselves and will kill all the generals together with their evil kill for all <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to their neighbouring countries, and that there will remain no trace of them.|$|E
