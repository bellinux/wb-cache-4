40|$|A simple {{analytical}} procedure, {{making use}} of the differential volatilities of the CrIII and CrVI complexes with trifluoroacetylacetone, was developed for the determination of CrVI and total Cr in river water. It {{was based on a}} modification of the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometric method with the addition of ammonium trifluoroacetylacetonate before starting the <b>thermal</b> <b>programme.</b> The analytical procedures developed was found to be applicable to the determination of 2 - 300 μg l- 1 of CrVI in the presence of up to 300 μg l- 1 of CrIII. The precision was found to vary from 3. 8 to 1. 4 % for 2. 5 - 25 μg l- 1 of CrVI, respectively. The applicability of the method developed to the analysis of river water samples was established by using parallel-method comparison, and no statistically significant difference between the results obtained and those of an ion-exchange resin method was observed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The steels mentioned before have been investigated (in plate thicknesses 15 and 50 mm) on the items: a) mechanical properties and microstructure after a weld thermal simulation; b) cold cracking susceptibility; c) mechanical properties of test welds; d) mechanical properties after deformation at different temperatures; e) calculation of the price-effect of application of FeE 460 instead of FeE 355. The results of the weld <b>thermal</b> simulation <b>programme</b> established that acceptable hardness values and good Charpy-V notch toughness properties can be obtained with all three steels. PWHT at temperatures of 560 ° or 590 ° C reduced the fracture energies of the QT material, and deteriorated {{the properties of the}} N and TM material. An acceptable PWHT temperature is 530 ° C. At high PWHT temperatures, all materials fractured intergranulaly (at low test temperatures). This has been associated with segregation of P to former austenite grain boundaries.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a reactor safety research <b>programme</b> <b>thermal</b> shocks of a cladded feed water nozzle have been carried out during simulated operating conditions (temperature = 300 degree = 11 MPa). The objective of these trials is to contribute to the understanding of crack initiation and propagation under realistic thermal shock conditions, to monitor crack initiation and growth by NDT on-line as well as off-line. Up to now the nozzle corner has been shocked 5200 times. The shocked area was surveilled by acoustic emission (AE). During the last 800 thermal shocks a new AE-equipment with optimized capabilities for detection, location of AE sources and interpretation of AE signals has been used.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} effects of both {{balneotherapy}} and mud-bath therapy treatments in patients affected by primary fibromyalgia (FM) using rheumatological, psychiatric, biochemical and proteomic approaches. METHODS: Forty-one FM patients (39 females, 2 males), who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria received a 2 -week <b>thermal</b> therapy <b>programme</b> consisting of therapy once daily for 6 days/week. Twenty-one patients received mud-bath treatment, while the other twenty balneotherapy. Pain, symptoms, and quality of life were assessed. Oxytocin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ATP and serotonin transporter levels during therapy were assayed. Comparative whole saliva (WS) proteomic analysis was performed using a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) and mass spectrometry techniques. RESULTS: We observed a reduction in pain, FIQ values and improvement of SF 36 in both groups of patients treated with mud-bath or balneotherapy. The improvement of the outcome measures occurred with different timing and duration in the two spa treatments. A significant decrease in BDNF concentrations was observed either after balneotherapy or mud-bath therapy when assayed after twelve weeks, while no significant change in oxytocin levels, ATP levels and serotonin transporter were detected. Significant differences were observed for phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM 1) and zinc alpha- 2 -glycoprotein 1 (AZGP 1) protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the thermal treatment might have a beneficial effect on the specific symptoms of the disease. In particular, while balneotherapy gives results that in most patients occur {{after the end of the}} treatment but which are no longer noticeable after 3 months, the mud-bath treatment gives longer lasting results...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is {{description}} of influence of the parameters of the 14 - 5 PH steel and cermets - PMFe-TiC composite plates brazing using nickel based brazing filler metal BNi 2 structure and properties of joints. Design/methodology/approach: Brazing was done in vacuum according to a special <b>thermal</b> cycle <b>programme.</b> Metallographic, X Ray analysis, microanalysis, hardness and tensile strength, as well quality investigations ofproduced joints have been done. Findings: It was shown that The joint has a eutectic multilayer structure with a zone of intermetallic compoundsin the steel – soldier and soldier – PM Fe-TiC composite - Ferro – Titanit plates boundary. Intermetalliccompounds zone differ clearly on account of a chemical composition, microstructure, and hardness from abrazing filler metal matrix. Research limitations/implications: It was shown that the diffusive zone from the PM Fe-TiC composite side isrich in titanium, molybdenum and iron, in the joint axis there is a zone rich in silicon, and in a boundary fillermetal – steel rich in iron and nickel. In the rich in nickel and iron filler metal matrix, there are intermetallicphases rich in chromium, which consist several percent of nickel, iron and molybdenum. The diffusive zonesare characterized by hardness higher than the filler metal matrix. Practical implications: As a result of conducted experiments a production of spinning nozzle of a die forpolyethylene granulation with a vacuum-brazed with a PM Fe-TiC composite plates cutting surface have beenworked out and applied in industry.

40|$|Homes {{with single}} glazing {{represent}} {{a large majority}} of the New Zealand housing stock. With the recent changes to the NZ Building Code Clause H 1 Energy Efficiency, new homes require higher glazing thermal performance. This will lead to an increased need for cost effective methods to improve window thermal performance in existing single glazed homes without completely replacing the windows, which includes 'secondary' glazing. There are several secondary glazing options available including 'stick-on' plastic glazing as well as aluminium framed glass solutions that are installed inside the existing joinery. Secondary glazing is marketed as a cost effective alternative to insulated glazing units, providing both improved acoustic and thermal insulation to existing windows. There is little information regarding the in-use performance and cost benefits of secondary glazing in New Zealand. This thesis explores the efficacy of the secondary glazing products when installed in existing single pane frames. A guarded hotbox was used to make thermal resistance measurements on a typical single glazed aluminium window with timber reveal liner. Four common secondary glazing systems were retrofitted into the window - (1) thin plastic film; (2) magnetically-attached acrylic sheet; (3) aluminium framed secondary glazing; and (4) aluminium framed low emissivity (low-E) secondary glazing. Models of 'typical' New Zealand homes created in the ALF building <b>thermal</b> simulation <b>programme</b> were used to explore the heating energy savings and cost benefits provided by the different secondary glazing systems in a range of locations. Of the tested products, the low-E secondary glazing produces the largest cost-benefits. At current energy and material costs, secondary glazing was found to not be a financially viable solution in warmer climates such as Auckland. In cooler climates such as Christchurch and Dunedin, secondary glazing was found to be a cost effective retrofit alternative for existing single glazed home...|$|R
40|$|As {{an energy}} saving measure, {{part of an}} {{integrated}} response to mitigate climate change, the New Zealand Government raised the legal minimum requirements for the thermal performance of new homes. A carbon footprint provides a means to quantify the effect this action has had to reduce the impact our new homes have on the environment. To date however, no study has been conducted to ascertain the carbon footprint of this change. This industry research project addresses this issue by determining the carbon footprint {{of the increase in}} home insulation levels in New Zealand. An investigation was made to quantify the additional embodied energy required to meet the new standard, and the resulting savings in electrical home space heating energy use. A scientific test and control method was employed. A standard timber framed three bedroom house design complying with the new thermal insulation standard was tested against the same design complying with the old standard over an operational life of 50 years. The test was conducted in New Zealand’s three climate zones {{with the aid of a}} computer <b>thermal</b> simulation <b>programme.</b> It was found that double glazed windows make up the bulk of the additional embodied energy and carbon. The benefits of the increase in thermal insulation increased with the colder climate zones which produced the smaller carbon footprint. The heating schedule employed within the home proved to be the most influential factor to both the carbon footprint size and the rate of environmental/carbon payback. It was also found that while current fluctuations in emissions from electricity generation, or even a potential increase in emissions from non-renewable energy sources had little effect on the rate of carbon payback, electricity from all renewable, clean energy sources lengthened carbon payback time six fold. The study showed that carbon payback for the increase in embodied energy could not be reached through heat energy savings within the 50 year operational life of the building if a typical low heating schedule was used powered through electricity generated by all renewable energy sources...|$|R
40|$|A housing Warrant of Fitness (WoF) {{has been}} {{independently}} proposed by three organisations {{as a way}} of improving the quality of rental housing in New Zealand and reducing housing related injuries and health problems. The New Zealand Green Building Council and the Housing and Health Research Programme (University of Otago, Wellington) have jointly developed a WoF based on Homestar and the Healthy Housing Index (labelled the GH WoF in this document). Housing New Zealand {{is in the process of}} developing a WoF for their properties (HNZ WoF), it has been tested on a number of state houses but the results have not yet been fully released. Both the GH WoF and the HNZ WoF target thermal and moisture performance amongst other minimum requirements for rental housing. The WoFs specify slightly different housing features as minimum acceptable standards. Both of the WoFs are structured as a checklist, with all items considered mandatory to pass the assessment. This research investigated the impact of meeting the WoF criteria which impact thermal performance. A thermal model of a villa style house suitable for a family of 4 was modelled in the <b>thermal</b> simulation <b>programme</b> EnergyPlus with a minimum practicable level of thermal performance. A range of New Zealand input values were sought and a number of sensitivity analyses were carried out to validate the model’s performance. Combinations of features each meeting the different criteria of the WoFs (such as insulation, ventilation and curtains) were then added to this house. The results of these models demonstrated that while adding these features will improve thermal performance, a simple pass/fail may be misleading because a house which fails may have equivalent thermal performance to a house which passes. The pass/fail result does not acknowledge trade-offs between temperature, energy consumption and running cost. Neither WoF accounts for the impact of climate on the ability to achieve comfortable indoor conditions, which has a greater impact than passing or failing a WoF. The criteria targeted at moisture performance were unable to be analysed as the moisture loads put into EnergyPlus could not be adequately verified. The research showed that while both WoF could lead to improved thermal comfort in rental housing, meeting the GH WoF requirements would bring about greater thermal performance benefits, the HNZ WoF enables the affordability of heat to be considered when insulating is not feasible...|$|R
40|$|Creating {{the built}} {{environment}} seems to require {{the destruction of the}} natural environment. The impact of a building on the environment goes far beyond the space that was cleared to make way for it. Humans require resources (energy, water, materials) to continue to live, work and play in the buildings that we have created. Reducing the impact of ever-enlarging human settlements is necessary to protect the environment in which we rely so much. The Subiaco Sustainable Demonstration Home (SSDH) is a collaborative effort between a local council and the building industry to create a house that uses fewer resources than normally built homes during its construction, use, and eventual demolition. The house has sustainability design features for water efficiency and water recycling, energy generation and efficient energy use, Universal design for the disabled, Low-allergen design to improve internal air quality, and sustainably sourced materials to minimise the cost to the environment due to its construction. The house has also been designed using Passive Solar (PS) design, so should remain thermally comfortable inside for most of the year, without the need of active heating or cooling systems. The house follows PS principles with: house and block having a north orientation, extensive glazing (protected in summer) on the north to maximise solar exposure in winter; internal thermal mass to minimise temperature swings; insulation to control heat energy flows; good ventilation to remove heat; and zoning to maximise human comfort. The house {{was the subject of a}} <b>thermal</b> monitoring <b>programme</b> throughout 2004, which will continue to January 2006. The objective of the monitoring was to record the internal thermal conditions (temperature and humidity) to determine how effective the house is in remaining within established thermal comfort levels without the need of mechanically-based heating or cooling systems. The house has demonstrated that it can remain within human thermal comfort levels for the majority of time, but needs to be operated properly by the occupants. In order for the house to be thermally comfortable, windows and curtains need to be opened at the right time to control the flow of energy into or out of the building. The result is a healthier, more comfortable living environment that is financially and environmentally cheaper to maintain than the currently constructed housing being created elsewhere around Australia...|$|R
