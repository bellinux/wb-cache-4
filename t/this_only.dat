5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; <b>this</b> <b>only</b> occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, <b>this</b> <b>only</b> applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} surrounding the telescope's tracking of space probes, <b>this</b> <b>only</b> {{took up a}} fraction of its observing time, with the remainder used for scientific observations.

The telescope has also been used for SETI observations.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, {{with the}} new type in hand, the Deseret News began {{printing}} with it. It would print one piece per issue in the new alphabet, usually a quotation from The Book of Mormon or the New Testament. However, <b>this</b> <b>only</b> lasted for one year, after which the practice stopped; it would start again in May 1864 and stop permanently {{at the end of}} that year.Benn Pitman, the brother of Isaac Pitman, was also interested in spelling reform, and by 1864 had published his own orthography, which the board of regents considered adopting. However, they ultimately decided not to and used the opportunity to re-affirm their commitment to the Deseret alphabet.|$|E

Following the delivery of the articulated SL79, the Class B and E were gradually retired, with the last tram running into 1985.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He {{had tried to}} augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but <b>this</b> <b>only</b> provoked large-scale protests and riots calling {{for an end to}} military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves to remove him from power.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs.

5|$|Soon after Apollo {{returns to}} Atlantis, the Asurans retaliate by {{launching}} a Stargate satellite that fires an energy beam, disabling the Apollo before {{zeroing in on}} Atlantis. The beam will deplete the city's shield in just under 30 hours, and with the satellite and its active Stargate over the city, the Expedition cannot evacuate using their own Stargate. McKay (David Hewlett) and Zelenka (David Nykl) submerge the city {{to mitigate the effect}} of the beam, but <b>this</b> <b>only</b> buys them nine more hours before the city is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, <b>this</b> <b>only</b> applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E
5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of <b>this,</b> <b>only</b> one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. They initially wore a black and gold scroll as a shoulder sleeve insignia, but that insignia was later redesignated the Ranger Tab and the Rangers adopted a black, red and white scroll similar to that unofficially worn by Ranger Battalions in World War II.|$|E

Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done <b>this</b> <b>only</b> once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E
5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however <b>this</b> <b>only</b> included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
