5|$|The {{equipment}} {{required for}} the {{gas tungsten arc welding}} operation includes a welding torch utilizing a non-consumable <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode,</b> a constant-current welding power supply, and a shielding gas source.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW) – {{also known as}} TIG (tungsten, inert gas), uses a non-consumable <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> to produce the weld. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas such as argon or helium.|$|E
25|$|La2O3 <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> are {{replacing}} thorianated <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> in Gas <b>tungsten</b> {{arc welding}} (TIG) due to safety concerns with thorium's radioactivity.|$|R
2500|$|All modern xenon short-arc lamps use a {{fused quartz}} {{envelope}} with thoriated <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes.</b> [...] Fused quartz {{is the only}} economically feasible material currently available that can withstand the high pressure (25 atmospheres for an IMAX bulb) and high temperature present in an operating lamp, while still being optically clear. [...] The thorium dopant in the electrodes greatly enhances their electron emission characteristics. [...] Because tungsten and quartz have different coefficients of thermal expansion, the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> are welded to strips of pure molybdenum metal or Invar alloy, which are then melted into the quartz to form the envelope seal.|$|R
5|$|Pure <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> (classified as WP or EWP) are {{general purpose}} and low cost electrodes. They have poor heat {{resistance}} and electron emission. They find limited use in AC welding of e.g. magnesium and aluminum.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode,</b> an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
30|$|It is {{also found}} in Figure  7 that the arc {{pressures}} decrease with the increases of the electrode diameter and gap width. These phenomena are similar to those in twin <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> TIG welding [34, 35].|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} electronic transport of few-layer-graphene (FLG) connected to superconducting electrodes. The device is prepared by mechanical exfoliation of graphite. A small mesa of FLG {{is placed on}} the surface of an insulating Alumina layer over silicon substrate, and is connected with two <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes,</b> separated by 2. 5 microns, grown by focused ion beam. While <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> are superconducting below 4 K, proximity induced superconductivity in FLG is observed below 1 K with a large differential resistance drop at low bias. Signatures of multiple Andreev reflections are observed as peaks located at voltages corresponding to sub-multiple values of the superconducting gap of the electrodes...|$|R
5000|$|Xenon {{is used as}} a plasma {{medium in}} high {{intensity}} arc lamps with <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Automotive xenon lights, however, are mostly mercury vapor bulbs with low pressure xenon to help striking the arc and producing light instantly.|$|R
5|$|The {{neptunium}} carbides NpC, Np2C3, and NpC2 (tentative) {{have been}} reported, {{but have not}} characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel. NpC is a non-stoichiometric compound, and could be better labelled as NpCx (0.82 ≤ x ≤ 0.96). It may {{be obtained from the}} reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at 1400°C or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric arc furnace using a <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode.</b> It reacts with excess carbon to form pure Np2C3. NpC2 is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660–2800°C.|$|E
5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode,</b> known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
5000|$|... 1959: Studies by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. They used single neuron {{recordings}} to map {{the visual}} cortex in unanesthesized, unrestrained cats using <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes.</b> This work won them the Nobel Prize in 1981 for information processing in the visual system.|$|R
50|$|Inside the {{fused quartz}} arc tube, two <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> doped with thorium are sealed into each end and an AC voltage {{is applied to}} them through {{molybdenum}} foil seals fused in silica. It is the arc between the two electrodes where the light is actually created.|$|R
25|$|Ignition: a {{high voltage}} pulse {{is used to}} produce an {{electrical}} arc – {{in a manner similar}} to a spark plug – which ionizes the xenon gas, creating a conducting channel between the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Electrical resistance is reduced within the channel, and current flows between the electrodes.|$|R
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode,</b> mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device types, including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E
500|$|Developments {{continued}} {{during the}} following decades. Linde developed water-cooled torches that helped prevent overheating when welding with high currents. During the 1950s, as the process continued to gain popularity, some users turned to carbon dioxide {{as an alternative to}} the more expensive welding atmospheres consisting of argon and helium, but this proved unacceptable for welding aluminum and magnesium because it reduced weld quality, so it is rarely used with GTAW today. [...] The use of any shielding gas containing an oxygen compound, such as carbon dioxide, quickly contaminates the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode,</b> making it unsuitable for the TIG process.|$|E

The chemically produced point can be used several times longer than ground points. This method reduces time and cost of preparing <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ignition: a {{high voltage}} pulse {{is used to}} produce an {{electrical}} arc - {{in a manner similar}} to a spark plug - which ionises the xenon gas, creating a conducting channel between the <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Electrical resistance is reduced within the channel, and current flows between the electrodes.|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{recording}} field potentials with <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> make it {{virtually impossible to}} use the same recording electrode also as a lesioning electrode, for example for histological confirmation of the recorded site, because the lesioning procedure usually wears off the tungsten tip. Therefore, the electrode would have to be replaced after each lesioning procedure, which is a very high cost solution to the problem. We present here a low cost, easy to make, high quality glass pipette-carbon fiber microelectrode that shows resistive, signal/noise and electrochemical coupling advantages over <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Also, currently used carbon fiber microelectrodes often show problems with electrical continuity, especially regarding electrochemical applications using a carbon-powder/resin mixture, with consequent low performance, besides the inconvenience of handling such a mixture. We propose here a new method for manufacturing glass pipette-carbon fiber microelectrodes with several advantages when recording intracerebral field potential...|$|R
500|$|Direct {{current of}} either polarity, {{positive}} or negative, {{can be used}} to weld aluminum and magnesium as well. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) allows for high penetration. Argon is commonly used as a shielding gas for DCEN welding of aluminum. Shielding gases with high helium contents are often used for higher penetration in thicker materials. Thoriated electrodes are suitable for use in DCEN welding of aluminum. Direct current with a positively charged electrode (DCEP) is used primarily for shallow welds, especially those with a joint thickness of less than [...] A thoriated <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> is commonly used, along with a pure argon shielding gas.|$|E
500|$|Russell Meredith of Northrop Aircraft {{perfected the}} process in 1941. Meredith named the process Heliarc because it used a <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> arc and helium as a {{shielding}} gas, but it {{is often referred to}} as tungsten inert gas welding (TIG). [...] The American Welding Society's official term is gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Linde Air Products developed a wide range of air-cooled and water-cooled torches, gas lenses to improve shielding, and other accessories that increased the use of the process. Initially, the electrode overheated quickly and, despite tungsten's high melting temperature, particles of tungsten were transferred to the weld. To address this problem, the polarity of the electrode was changed from positive to negative, but the change made it unsuitable for welding many non-ferrous materials. Finally, the development of alternating current units made it possible to stabilize the arc and produce high quality aluminum and magnesium welds.|$|E

50|$|Plasma {{arc welding}} is an arc welding process wherein {{coalescence}} {{is produced by}} the heat obtained from a constricted arc setup between a tungsten/alloy <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> and the water-cooled (constricting) nozzle (non-transferred arc) or between a tungsten/alloy <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrode</b> and the job (transferred arc). The process employs two inert gases, one forms the arc plasma and the second shields the arc plasma. Filler metal {{may or may not}} be added.|$|E
500|$|Aluminum and {{magnesium}} {{are most often}} welded using alternating current, {{but the use of}} direct current is also possible, depending on the properties desired. Before welding, the work area should be cleaned and may be preheated to [...] for aluminum or to a maximum of [...] for thick magnesium workpieces to improve penetration and increase travel speed. AC current can provide a self-cleaning effect, removing the thin, refractory aluminum oxide (sapphire) layer that forms on aluminum metal within minutes of exposure to air. This oxide layer must be removed for welding to occur. When alternating current is used, pure <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> or zirconiated <b>tungsten</b> <b>electrodes</b> are preferred over thoriated electrodes, as the latter are more likely to [...] "spit" [...] electrode particles across the welding arc into the weld. Blunt electrode tips are preferred, and pure argon shielding gas should be employed for thin workpieces. Introducing helium allows for greater penetration in thicker workpieces, but can make arc starting difficult.|$|R
40|$|In 2014, Wu et al. {{discovered}} an unexpected result. Turbulence can facilitate ignition through differential diffusion when the effective Lewis number (Le) of mixtures is sufficiently larger than unity using small electrode gaps (d(gap) 1 {{is independent of}} d(gap). We apply the same hydrogen mixtures at the equivalence ratio phi = 5. 1 (Le approximate to 2. 3) and phi = 0. 18 (Le approximate to 10. 3) as Wu et al. in our large fan-stirred cruciform bomb capable of generating near-isotropic turbulence to measure values of MIE {{as a function of}} d(gap) at both quiescence and intense turbulence (the rms turbulent fluctuating velocity u'= 5. 4 m/s) conditions. A drastic fall of values of laminar and turbulent MIE (MIEL and MIET) with increasing d(gap) is observed.
