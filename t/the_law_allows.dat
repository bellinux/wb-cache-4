25|$|On 18 May 2016, the Congress of Morelos voted 20 to 6 {{to approve}} the {{constitutional}} change to legalize same-sex marriage. A constitutional change requires the ratification of at least 17 of the 33 municipalities in the state. The Government expected the ratification process to finish within a month. Governor Graco Ramírez welcomed {{the approval of the}} bill. The 33 municipalities had until 25 June 2016 to act on the constitutional change. If they did not act, then on 29 June the reform would be approved by constructive assent (silence from the authority with respect to a request, in this case, the reform from Congress). At the end of the process, a total of 17 municipalities had ratified the constitutional change and 15 had voted against ratification, while 1 municipality was awarded an extra week, although the clear majority being in favor meant that same-sex marriage would become legal in the state. The municipalities which voted in favor of the reform were Cuautla, Emiliano Zapata, Huitzilac, Jantetelco, Jiutepec, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco, Tetecala, Tlaquiltenango, Totolapan, Yautepec de Zaragoza and Yecapixtla. Additionally, the municipalities of Axochiapan, Cuernavaca, Mazatepec, Tepalcingo and Tlayacapan did not vote (constructive assent). The remaining municipalities voted against the change. The law was promulgated and published in the state's official gazette on 4 July 2016. It took effect on 5 July. The state adoption agency clarified that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>allows</b> same-sex couples to adopt jointly; the adoption process is open to all spouses in Morelos.|$|E

Because this prohibits 90% of wine made in the United States, but does not affect New Jersey's small wineries, proponents of the law fear that {{this section of the}} law will be struck down as unconstitutional. [...] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had struck down a similar limit in Massachusetts in 2008 in light of the United States Supreme Court decision addressing direct shipping laws a few years earlier.|$|E
