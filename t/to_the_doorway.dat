5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|The south transept's {{southern}} wall {{is nearly}} complete, displaying the fine workmanship {{of the first}} phase. It shows the Gothic pointed arch style in the windows that first appeared in France in the mid-12th century and was apparent in England around 1170, but hardly appeared in Scotland until the early 13th century. It also shows the round early Norman window design that continued {{to be used in}} Scotland during the entire Gothic period (Fig. 6). The windows and the quoins are of finely cut ashlar sandstone. A doorway in the south-west portion of the wall has large mouldings and has a pointed oval window placed above it. Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> are two lancet-arched windows that are topped at the clerestory level with three round-headed windows. The north transept has much less of its structure preserved, but much of what does remain, taken together with a study by John Slezer in 1693, shows that it was similar to the south transept, except that the north transept had no external door and featured a stone turret containing a staircase.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2008, protesters from The World Can't Wait, chained {{themselves}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of {{the recruiting}} office, blocking the entrance, and preventing people from {{moving in and}} out.|$|E

50|$|From December 2012, a {{programme}} of refurbishment started, {{which will}} ultimately {{cover the entire}} fleet of 474 vehicles. Interior improvements include new universal access toilets, provision of wheelchair spaces, and flip-up seating next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b> <b>The</b> first refurbished set, 4-car set K12, was returned to revenue service on 11 January 2012.|$|R
50|$|The caisson {{contains}} a large basement and is penetrated by double steel {{doors at the}} south where a tender may be landed to transfer personnel or supplies and a steel door at <b>the</b> west, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> breakwater. Recessed ladders are found at both elevations for access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> and deck above.|$|R
25|$|A gentry {{household}} in the 17th century accommodated visitors. The New Parlour Chamber, displayed as a second-best bed chamber, {{may have been}} occupied by the nursemaid and her charges, or {{other members of the}} household. The screen at right angles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> prevented draughts through the bed curtains. An adjoining dressing room or closet is used to display reproduction costumes. The warm colours of the panelling and bed curtains are echoed in the carpet on the table, a feature of wealthier 17th-century houses. Tables or beds were ideal places to display a fine carpet too valuable to walk upon.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend Harry Peach, a fellow member of the Design and Industries Association (DIA), Pick {{explained}} his choice of Holden: [...] "I may say {{that we are going to}} build our stations upon the Morden extension railway to the most modern pattern. We are going to discard entirely all ornament. We are going to build in reinforced concrete. The station will be simply a hole in the wall, everything being sacrificed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and some notice above to tell you to what the doorway leads. We are going to represent the DIA gone mad, and in order that I may go mad in good company I have got Holden to see that we do it properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{work was}} carried out in the late 13th or the 14th century, which is the period {{ascribed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> on the south side. [...] The church was enlarged in the 16th century when a second aisle was erected {{on the north side of}} the church, running the length of the building, with an arcade of four arches added between the old and new parts of the building. [...] Some restoration was undertaken in 1840, under the Chester-based architect Thomas Jones. [...] During this work, the rector Hugh Wynne Jones discovered a blocked 12th-century arch set into the west wall. It is thought by some writers to be the original chancel arch, but it has also been suggested that it was the entrance to a tower at the west end, which was said in 1833 to have once existed.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a rectangular plan, principal entrances <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper storey from Wharf Street, and a corrugated iron double hipped roof, {{which may have}} the remnants of an early roof lantern. The two entrances from Wharf Street are emphasised by projecting gabled roof section surmounting brick projections with round arched openings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b> <b>The</b> two entrances are slightly different in detail and size, reflecting {{the development of the}} building. The former Bond Store is of brick and stone construction; the external walls are face brick and the foundations of the building are rock faced stone. The principal facade of the building, off Wharf Street, is dominated by the two entrances, which are separated and also flanked by segmental arched window openings.|$|R
25|$|In the Renaissance {{period the}} Italian doors are quite simple, their architects trusting more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> for effect; but in France and Germany the {{contrary}} is the case, the doors being elaborately carved, {{especially in the}} Louis XIV and Louis XV periods, and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches, <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> being in plain masonry. While in Italy <b>the</b> tendency was <b>to</b> give scale by {{increasing the number of}} panels, in France <b>the</b> contrary seems <b>to</b> have been <b>the</b> rule; and one of the great doors at Fontainebleau, which is in two leaves, is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the house}} {{comprises}} 15 main rooms on 3 levels, {{with a wide}} vestibule/hallway running centrally north-south through the house on each level. The floor plans of all 3 levels are almost identical. The principal rooms {{on the ground and}} first floor are over 4 metres in height and have decorative plaster cornices which are perforated or undercut, and perforated ceiling roses (these appear to have been designed <b>to</b> ventilate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roof or floor cavity above). There is extensive use of cedar joinery throughout, including panelled reveals and carved transoms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b> <b>The</b> hallway on the principal level has tessellated tiles on the floor and corinthian pilasters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> archway separating hall from vestibule. There are 8 fireplaces with marble surrounds and tiles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hearths, as well as the kitchen flue.|$|R
500|$|During the end, [...] "Ghost" [...] quickly {{transitions}} into [...] "Haunted" [...] {{which contains}} elements of hip hop and R music. Kitty Empire of The Observer {{described it as}} a dance-pop track talking about [...] "being haunted in love". Instrumentally, it consists of percussion and an off-kilter club beat which was compared with Jacques Greene and Burial. Its sound is operatic and the lyrics undersung, with piano chords and various rhythmic effects, such as foot-tapping. Lyrically, it talks about desire, with Ryan Dennehy from AbsolutePunk noting it was about [...] "frank sexual desires". The Village Voice Brittany Spanos felt the song was discussing lingering memories of the past. Trent Wolbe of The Verge compared the sound of [...] "Haunted" [...] with music by bands The Knife, Sade and Boards of Canada. Andrew Barker from Variety found a trance genre similar to Madonna's Bedtime Stories. The song includes sexual lyrics that are reflected throughout the album, including, [...] "The bedroom's my runway / Slap me! / I'm pinned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> / Kiss, bite, foreplay" [...] and [...] "My wicked tongue / Where will it be?" [...] set to [...] "sonorous... and chilly charged beats".|$|E
500|$|AbsolutePunk writer Ryan Dennehy remarked in {{his review}} that [...] "ethereal echoes" [...] of the singer's voice [...] "elevate it above just a post-Weeknd, dark update to staid topics". Philip Matusavage of musicOMH {{described}} the sound of [...] "Ghost" [...] as [...] "sleek ambient" [...] dubstep, adding that it sounded typical for the singer {{and served as a}} [...] "Beyoncé manifesto". He concluded his review by stating that if the references to disagreements Beyoncé talked about in the song were real, [...] "the result proves to be the most sonically adventurous album of Beyoncé's career." [...] Julia Leconte writing for Now praised Beyoncé's vocals as [...] "perfect". Exclaim! Ryan B. Patrick felt that the song's minimalistic sound allowed the singer to [...] "ironically champion artistic integrity and proclaim her thoughts on the industry". Chris Bosman from the website Consequence of Sound who felt that the song was the record's [...] "mood setter" [...] and contained [...] "ghostly vibes", wrote that it [...] "dabbles in R, Evian Christ's drag-influenced codeine hip-hop, and Nothing Was the Same's Xanax club rap". He felt that during the lines [...] "Slap me, I'm pinned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> / Kiss, bite, foreplay", Beyoncé [...] "slides" [...] the last word, making the song sound [...] "even less radio friendly". Bosman further stated that [...] "Haunted" [...] along with [...] "Partition" [...] and [...] "Mine", [...] "are confident enough to take one, two, three left turns while maintaining thematic cohesion." [...] The Guardian journalist Michael Cragg compared the song with works by Janelle Monáe and described its sound as [...] "doom-laden". Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar magazine felt that [...] "It's remarkable to hear a pop star at the height of her arena-tour powers taking chances like 'Haunted,' a dirge of a song that behaves more as spoken word until it's 'Vogue'-y breakdown".|$|E

5|$|Milsom street leads up hill, {{from the}} Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, {{which was founded}} in 1738 as The Mineral Water Hospital, <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Paragon which overlooks the Walcot area. The Paragon was {{designed}} by Thomas Warr Attwood. Each building has matching doors and windows with central pediments and flat entablatures either side of the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and pediments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b> Numbers 22 <b>to</b> 37 continue <b>the</b> theme from numbers 1 to 21 and were completed in 1775 by Joseph Axford, a local mason. Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored.|$|R

[...] She is burning incense, and has {{presented}} offerings {{of flowers and}} food to the cat's spirit, together with a plate of milk. [...] On {{the wall behind the}} priestess is an Egyptian fresco, and a statue of the goddess Sekhmet or Bastet enthroned guards the entrance to the temple. [...] Stairs lead up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> through which a view of the sky and other buildings are visible.|$|E
2500|$|Jess Neely, a {{brilliant}} half-back and {{a handsome man}} on the campus, is remembered for his popularity {{among members of the}} opposite sex and for an incident that occurred just prior to a football game with Southern Presbyterian in Clarksville. Miles had done an exceptionally good job in mentally preparing his team for the game. He climaxed the pre-game, locker-room exhortation with a soaring call for courage and deathless allegiance to [...] "dear Ol' Normal." [...] Neely was greatly affected by the words of his coach for he leaped to his feet and, roaring like an angry bull, led the team in a rush <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> opening to the field. He misjudged the extremely low entrance, and his head received the full impact of the strip of wall above the doorway. He was revived shortly before the kickoff, but he never quite knew where he was, frequently huddling and aligning himself with the enemy.|$|E

2500|$|In Karaite Judaism the deuteronomic verse [...] "And {{you shall}} write {{them on the}} doorposts of your houses and your gates" [...] (...) is {{interpreted}} to be a metaphor and not as referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rabbanite mezuzah. Thus Karaites do not traditionally use mezuzot, but put up a little plaque {{in the shape of}} the two Tables of the Law with the Ten Commandments. In Israel, where they might try not to make other Jews feel uncomfortable, many Karaites make an exception and place a mezuzah on their doorpost as well. The Karaite version of the mezuzah is fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> of public buildings and sometimes to private buildings, too.|$|R
