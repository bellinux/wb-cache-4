40|$|Formation Gibbs {{free energy}} of point defects and oxygen {{clusters}} in uranium dioxide at high-pressure high-temperature conditions are calculated from first principles, using the LSDA+U approach for the electronic {{structure and the}} Debye model for the lattice vibrations. The phonon contribution on Frenkel pairs {{is found to be}} notable, whereas it is negligible for the Schottky defect. Hydrostatic compression changes the formation energies drastically, making defect concentrations depend more sensitively on pressure. Calculations show that, if no oxygen clusters are considered, uranium vacancy becomes predominant in overstoichiometric UO 2 with the aid of the contribution from lattice vibrations, while compression favors oxygen defects and suppresses uranium vacancy greatly. At ambient pressure, however, the experimental observation of predominant oxygen defects in this regime can be reproduced only in a form of cuboctahedral clusters, underlining the importance of defect clustering in UO 2 +x. Making use of the point defect model, an equation of state for non-stoichiometric oxides is established, which is then applied to describe the shock Hugoniot of UO 2 +x. Furthermore, the oxidization and compression behavior of uranium monoxide, <b>triuranium</b> <b>octoxide,</b> uranium trioxide, and a series of defective UO 2 at zero Kelvin are investigated. The evolution of mechanical properties and electronic structures with an increase of the oxidation degree are analyzed, revealing the transition of the groundstate of uranium oxides from metallic to Mott insulator and then to charge-transfer insulator due to the interplay of strongly correlated effects of 5 f orbitals and the shift of electrons from uranium to oxygen atoms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{sensitivity}} {{of an active}} fast neutron assay system for the measurement of 235 U enrichment in small samples of low-enriched <b>triuranium</b> <b>octoxide</b> (U 3 O 8) is described. The system comprises four organic liquid scintillation detectors in a polyethylene container in which a stimulating americium-lithium neutron source is placed below the sample to be interrogated. The sensitivities of both the singles and doubles assay have been corrected for the contribution from the stimulating source and for spontaneous fission in 238 U and found to be (0. 116  ±  0. 008) cps per detector per % wt. (7 %) and (0. 0006  ±  0. 0002) cps per detector per % wt. (33 %), respectively. The singles approach with the 4 -detector arrangement has been compared via Monte Carlo (MCNP- 5) simulations with a fast neutron counting system based on 12 detectors in which the source is placed adjacent to the sample, similar to the arrangement {{referred to as the}} liquid scintillator uranium neutron collar. This comparison confirms that whilst singles assay with the 4 -detector arrangement is feasible, the collar arrangement does not yield a singles yield that can be correlated with enrichment due to the perturbative scattering by the U 3 O 8 sample. The 4 -detector arrangement is particularly suitable for small samples of fresh, low-enriched material that might arise in forensic applications and the analysis of un-irradiated, orphan wastes. In these cases the efficiency of coincidence methods may be too low to yield a practical route to enrichment assessment. Conversely, the use of many detectors and/or a high-intensity source by which sensitivity might be increased might restrict the portability and ease of use of the apparatus.

40|$|In {{order to}} verify non-nuclear weapon states {{to comply with}} the {{non-proliferation}} treaty, international authorities such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducts inspections at facilities handling fissile or fertile nuclear materials, such as uranium. During these inspections, environmental swipe samples are taken and sent to the IAEA’s network of analytical laboratories (NWAL) for analysis. Analysis of microparticles collected on these swipes by mass spectrometric methods such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) provides a means to detect clandestine undeclared activities. There are, however, no relevant (certified) reference materials available that can be used as calibration or quality control standards. Therefore, a system has been constructed at Forschungszentrum Jülich for the production of mono-disperse uranium microparticles with accurately characterized isotopic compositions and elemental contents. First microparticle samples have been prepared successfully and are currently being investigated. First microparticles have been prepared successfully and have been characterized by various methods, including FIB milling to characterize the inner particle structure. Particles have been prepared using various precursor solutions, such as uranyl nitrate and uranyl acetate, to investigate the effect of the precursor solution on the final particle morphology and chemical form. ISO Guide 34 states that for the certification of materials as (certified) reference materials, quantification of the inhomogeneity and stability of property values is of high importance. Since some between-bottle inhomogeneity is likely to occur during production, homogenization of the particles in a suspension is considered before characterization. However, during such a step, isotope exchange between uranium of the microparticles and natural uranium in the liquid might significantly alter the isotopic composition of the microparticles. Therefore, experiments are performed to determine the rate of exchange between both uranium trioxide and <b>triuranium</b> <b>octoxide</b> and uranyl ions in an aqueous solution...|$|E
