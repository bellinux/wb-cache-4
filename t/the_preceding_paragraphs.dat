60|$|Writing {{several years}} later than the date of <b>the</b> <b>preceding</b> <b>paragraphs,</b> I commend the modern Unitarians for their candour in giving up the {{possible}} worshipability of Christ, if not very God,--a proof that truth will ultimately prevail.

Mary scored out a paragraph describing Elinor, thus getting rid of several clich√©s ("fortune had smiled on her," [...] "a favourite of fortune," [...] "turning tears of misery to those of joy"); she omitted a clause which offered a weak motivation of Elinor's father's will (the possibility of her marrying, while hardly more than a child, one of her guardian's sons); she curtailed the extravagance of a rhapsody on the perfect happiness which Woodville and Elinor would have enjoyed.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Ricardo, therefore, {{would not}} have said that wages had risen, because a {{labourer}} could obtain two pecks of flour instead of one, for a day's labour; but if last year he received, for a day's labour, something which required eight hours' labour to produce it, and this year something which requires nine hours, then Mr. Ricardo would say that wages had risen. A rise of wages, with Mr. Ricardo, meant {{an increase in the}} cost of production of wages; {{an increase in the number}} of hours' labour which go to produce the wages of a day's labour; an increase in the proportion of the fruits of labour which the labourer receives for his own share; an increase in the ratio between the wages of his labour and the produce of it.
