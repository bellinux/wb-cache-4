5|$|The costliest war in U.S. {{history in}} terms of American life, this war {{has been the subject}} of, or the {{backdrop}} to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men. Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge). Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951), or Shenandoah (1965), on <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most watched documentary in the history of PBS.|$|E

In the scrambled attack in gusty weather, Richthofen was cut out of his firing approach on one British plane by an interposed German plane. Böhme and Boelcke were both closing on the other.|$|E

25|$|Almodóvar's next film, Broken Embraces (2009) {{a romantic}} thriller which centres {{on a blind}} novelist, Harry Caine (Lluís Homar), who uses his works to recount both his former life as a filmmaker, and <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> took his sight. A key figure in Caine's past is the Lena (Penélope Cruz), an {{aspiring}} actress who gets embroiled in a love triangle with Caine and a paranoid millionaire, Ernesto (José Luis Gómez). The film has a complex structure, mixing past and present and film within a film. Almodóvar previously used this type of structure in Talk to Her and Bad Education.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there were}} {{occasional}} challenges to {{his position as}} Liverpool's number 1, Grobbelaar was a virtual ever-present from Clemence's departure {{to the start of}} the 1990s which coincided with the end of the club's dominance. He was an ever-present in his first five league campaigns at Anfield, when Liverpool were champions four times and runners-up on the other occasion. However, in 1988–89, injuries and illness restricted his first team opportunities and he played 21 times in the league, with Mike Hooper taking his place on the other 17 occasions. However, he was fit to face Everton in the 3–2 FA Cup win on 20 May 1989, though six days later he conceded a last minute goal to Arsenal midfielder Michael Thomas on the final day of the league season as the league title was wrenched from Liverpool's grasp and headed to Highbury instead. A month earlier, he played in the FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest which was played at Old Trafford after the original match at Hillsborough was cancelled due to <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> led to 96 fans dying on terracing just behind Grobbelaar's goal. Grobbelaar attended many of the victim's funerals.|$|E

25|$|Both of the lovers' fates are {{interwoven}} {{yet they}} deceive {{the other in}} a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely {{what is going on in}} the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

500|$|The movie stages re-creations {{of various}} scenarios, {{based on the}} {{testimony}} of key players and suspects, including Van der Sloot. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest television ratings in the network's 11-year history. Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie received mixed reviews from critics. Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News called the movie [...] "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> consumed the nation's attention for months." [...] However, Jake Meaney of PopMatters found the film to be surprisingly [...] "calm and levelheaded", and praised Pollan's portrayal of Holloway's mother. A follow-up film, Justice for Natalee Holloway, aired in mid-2011 on LMN. This film picks up in 2010, on the five-year anniversary of Holloway's disappearance. It continues to center on the investigation and what exactly happened to Holloway.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times {{columnist}} Andrew Hanson {{thought the}} whole episode was [...] "disturbing, even for Fringe", and {{was pleased that}} the killers were shot rather than arrested due to the heinousness of their crimes. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall believed the episode contained some of the cast's best performances, especially praising Lance Reddick's portrayal of a [...] "very human, caring hero who has been damaged but not crippled by <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> struck his family" [...] and Anna Torv's ability to subtly play both Olivias. IGN's Phil Pirrello believed [...] "the Broyles Factor padded a cool premise with a solid (if unremarkable) execution that lead to a great final five minutes." [...] In January 2013, IGN ranked it the eighth best episode of the entire series, explaining that [...] "this one holds a special place for having so many elements of what makes Fringe great... There's only one word for the way this episode handled two awesome storylines and intertwined them seamlessly: brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|The Charge {{itself and}} <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>that</b> {{resulted}} was blamed on both Lucan and Nolan by William Howard Russell–Nolan, for misunderstanding {{the order and}} issuing a confusing message, and Lucan, for not properly {{keeping an eye on}} the terrain. Raglan himself primarily blamed Lucan, who was infuriated by this and wrote a letter to Horse Guards Parade disputing Raglan's claim. This was too much for Viscount Hardinge, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, who had Lucan resign his command and return to Britain. With Hardinge unwilling to give him a court martial, Lucan wrote a pamphlet titled A Vindication of the Earl of Lucan from Lord Raglan's Reflections and a series of letters to The Times that revealed Raglan's order to have been highly ambiguous and [...] "not the kind of dispatch required by an officer on the battlefield". At the same time, Nolan's method of delivery had been imperious, and he had insisted the urgency of the attack – something clear in Raglan's verbal order to him, but not in the written order. Public opinion became divided; people both attacked Nolan and rallied to his defence. The major newspapers, at least, maintained that with Nolan's status as a mere messenger it was inconceivable that he alone could have destroyed the Light Brigade without failings by Lucan. Lord Cardigan defended Nolan by saying the Captain [...] "did not have the least idea of the mistake which was about to be perpetrated." [...] Within the Crimea, however, the majority [...] "roundly damned" [...] Nolan. The Charge was soon overshadowed by other scandalous and bloody military failures such as the continued failure of the Siege of Sevastopol.|$|E

50|$|Although van der Byl opposed {{segregation}} and {{the oppression of}} the Black population, van der Byl {{did not believe in}} majority rule.

This motivated him to write a novel centered on two Afghan women.|$|R
500|$|On 19 April 2010 the FIL {{published}} {{its final}} {{report to the}} International Olympic Committee on Kumaritashvili's death. The report found that the sled used by Kumaritashvili had met all FIL standards. It attributed the accident to [...] "driving errors starting in curve 15/16 which as an accumulation ended in the impact that resulted in him leaving the track and subsequently hitting a post. ... This is a tragic result that should not have occurred {{as a result of}} an initial driving error". As the sled hit the wall at the curve-16 exit, it catapulted off the track, causing Kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely.
