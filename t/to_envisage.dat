In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> the concept in its original setting.|$|E

Although initially {{he did not}} approve of the organisation, he {{continued to be a}} Freemason until his death in 1902. The shortcomings of the Freemasons, in his opinion, later caused him <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> his own secret society with the goal of bringing the entire world under British rule. According to Carroll Quigley, he set up the Round Table movement to this end.|$|E
25|$|GGYC {{also argued}} that the rules that should apply to the race must be the SNG rules that were in force when GGYC filed its challenge. Otherwise, said GGYC, SNG could {{arbitrarily}} change the rules {{so as to make}} it impossible for the challenger to win. For example, said GGYC, the modified rules could specify that the challenger would have to race while dragging an anchor. According to GGYC, it did not make sense <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> that the rules could be changed after the challenge was issued, since the challenger based its challenge on SNG's rules {{at the time of the}} challenge. GGYC also challenged certain provisions of the agreement between ISAF and SNG, in particular concerning the powers of the jury.|$|E

25|$|In his {{influential}} Principles of Philosophy of 1644, René Descartes applied his mechanical physical laws <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> swirling particles {{forming the}} Earth as a layered sphere. This natural philosophy was recast in Biblical terms by the theologian Thomas Burnet, whose Sacred Theory of the Earth {{published in the}} 1680s proposed complex explanations based on natural laws, and explicitly rejected the simpler approach of invoking miracles as incompatible with the methodology of natural philosophy (the precursor to science). Burnett maintained that less than 6,000 years ago the Earth had emerged from chaos as a perfect sphere, with paradise on land over a watery abyss. This crust had dried out and cracked, and its collapse caused the Biblical Deluge, forming mountains as well as underground caverns where the water retreated. He {{made no mention of}} fossils, but inspired other diluvial theories that did.|$|E

Tchaikovsky, however, had been unimpressed. In 1882, the publisher Besel asked Tchaikovsky's opinion about an Arabesque for solo piano that Lyadov had written. Tchaikovsky replied, [...] "It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> any thing more vapid in content than this composer's music.

Hoskins writes that on a desolate moor one can feel oneself imaginatively {{back in time to}} the Bronze Age, but that there are now few such unaltered places left. He argues that the landscape historian [...] "needs to be a botanist, a physical geographer, and a naturalist, as well as an historian" [...] to understand a scene in full: ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur Max {{designed}} the sets {{such as the}} alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the Prometheus and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> the connections between them and {{to know where the}} CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the Prometheus, Max researched NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted [...] "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the draft}} memoir {{complete}} and clandestinely transmitted, Speer sought a new project. He found one while taking his daily exercise, walking in {{circles around the}} prison yard. Measuring the path's distance carefully, Speer set out to walk the distance from Berlin to Heidelberg. He then expanded his idea into a worldwide journey, visualizing the places he was [...] "traveling" [...] through while walking the path around the prison yard. Speer ordered guidebooks and other materials about the nations through which he imagined he was passing, so as <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> as accurate a picture as possible. Meticulously calculating every meter traveled, and mapping distances to the real-world geography, he began in northern Germany, passed through Asia by a southern route before entering Siberia, then crossed the Bering Strait and continued southwards, finally ending his sentence [...] south of Guadalajara, Mexico.|$|E
500|$|By early 2009, {{business}} analysts Lonsec Agribusiness Research considered Great Southern to {{be financially}} stressed, {{and that it}} was [...] "hard <b>to</b> <b>envisage</b> a rapid turnaround in the outlook" [...] for the company. They gave Great Southern as managers the second-lowest rating on their assessment scale, just short of stating that the investment would be [...] "detrimental to an investor's...portfolio". Great Southern's banks refused a request in 2009 for a further $35million loan. Great Southern's attempts to extract itself from financial trouble were unsuccessful and by May 2009, when a trading halt was called, the company's shares were worth just 12 cents. On 16 May 2009 administrators were appointed under the Corporations Act 2001, with the companies' assets passing into control of receivers McGrathNicol on 18 May 2009. The assets of the group were primarily its land holdings. By the time it went into administration, they were valued at A$1.8 billion, however, despite company expansion plans, its net assets had not grown for four years.|$|E
