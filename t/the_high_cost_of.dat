5|$|Although the Interface 2 proved popular, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> ROM cartridges, and {{the fact}} that they were limited to 16K in size, meant that very few titles were {{released}} in this format.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> {{the first}} series, Michael Grade (the then {{controller}} of programming of BBC One) {{was reluctant to}} sign off a second series without major improvements and cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years between the two series.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored welding {{machines}} are most popular at the hobbyist level, as the machines are slightly simpler but mainly because they avoid {{the cost of}} providing shield gas, either through a rented cylinder or with <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> disposable cylinders.|$|E

5|$|Hounds of Love was {{released}} in 1985. Because of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace. Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position.|$|E
5|$|The Cook Islands Golden Oldies Netball Association {{is a local}} {{league that}} is part of a network of leagues in various sports aimed at seniors.

5|$|The lower {{power house}} also {{underwent}} major rehabilitation measures. It {{was shut down}} in December 1974 due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> operation and maintenance.

5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|Claiming that {{publishers}} {{would no}} longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets. Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular and widely circulated among anti-interventionists. Two of them, <b>The</b> <b>High</b> <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> Hate and America Has No Enemies In Asia, had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, There Is No Halfway Neutrality printed 30,000 copies. The last pamphlet in the series, Seeking Foreign Trouble, {{attracted the attention of}} the German embassy in Washington DC which bought and distributed more than 500 copies of it.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{began the}} {{physical}} {{exploration of space}} during the 20th century {{with the advent of}} high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2009 Syracuse Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon began {{attempts}} {{to have an}} American Hockey League (AHL) outdoor game for his franchise. Cost estimates for hosting the game were close to $1 million. Unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic, the league did not run the event, meaning the Crunch had to finance the entire project. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> hosting was a reason for other franchises not pursuing outdoor games prior.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands {{in order to prevent}} further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> some Zinfandels.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft, a lack {{of clear}} air-to-air {{missions}} due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on exports, {{and development of the}} more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production. A final procurement tally of 187 operational production aircraft was established in 2009, and the last F-22 was delivered to the USAF in 2012.|$|E
40|$|Price indices for {{thirteen}} Canadian {{cities for}} 1900 to 1950 demonstrate large regional differences in <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living until 1914. After 1914 regional price levels converged. Before the war, western Canadian cities had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living. After 1920 cities in Ontario had <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> living. Accounting for these trends in regional <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> living reveals that regional real wage and real income structures {{have been present}} and stable since at least 1901. Thus, regional wage and income disparities are long-standing and persistent features of the Canadian economy. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways.

5|$|The {{remnant of}} the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would connect with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan's West Side.

5|$|There was {{controversy}} over <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the line as a whole. The project was divided up into four phases, in part, {{to maximize the}} ability of the project to receive funding from the Federal Government as part of the Department of Transportation's New Starts Program. The initial projections for the cost of the line were made in the 2004 FEIS, with Phase 1 estimated to cost $3.8 billion, Phase 2 estimated to cost $3.4 billion, and Phases 3 and 4 each estimated to cost $4.8 billion.|$|E
