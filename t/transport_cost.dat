5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of cotton {{began to be}} used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A commodities exchange, opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first cotton mill. In the early 1800s, John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.|$|E

The refill pack itself is not reused, but being a minimal package for carrying the product home, it requires less material than one with the durability and features (reclosable top, convenient shape, etc.) required for easy use of the product, while avoiding the <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> and emissions of returning the reusable package to the factory.|$|E
500|$|The railway {{that opened}} in September 1825 was [...] long and ran from Phoenix Pit, Old Etherley Colliery, to Cottage Row, Stockton; {{there was also a}} half-mile (0.8km) branch to the depot at Darlington, [...] of the Hagger Leases branch, and a [...] branch to Yarm. Most of the track used [...] {{malleable}} iron rails, and [...] of [...] cast iron rails were used for junctions. The line was single track with four passing loops each mile; square sleepers supported each rail separately so that horses could walk between them. Stone was used for the sleepers to the west of Darlington and oak to the east; Stephenson would have preferred all of them to have been stone, but the <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> was too high as they were quarried in the Auckland area. The railway opened with the company owing money and unable to raise further loans; Pease advanced money twice early in 1826 so the workers could be paid. By August 1827 the company had paid its debts and was able to raise more money; that month the Black Boy branch opened and construction began on the Croft and Hagger Leases branches. During 1827 shares rose from £120 at the start to £160 at the end.|$|E

We present a case study of the firm location decisions of exporters in South Africa to illustrate the significance in particular of domestic <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> for manufactured exports. The message from this Policy Brief is that Africa's international <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> are significantly higher than that of other regions, and its domestic <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> could be just as significant.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{examining the}} effects of domestic <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> on trade flows is scarce. The few studies available rely mostly on distance-based measures as proxies of <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> which impede analyzing the trade impacts of transport-infrastructure improvements, a critical aspect in regional and public policy. Applying a novel methodology that combines real freight costs and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis {{to the case of}} Colombia, this paper measures the extent to which domestic <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> -from the place of production to the port of shipment- act as a friction to international trade. Domestic <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> are found to significantly affect the prospects of exporting. For instance, regions within the country with <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> in the 25 th percentile export around 2. 3 times more than regions with <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> in the 75 th percentile, once other factors are controlled for. Export increases from road improvements are found to be larger in regions with initially higher <b>transport</b> <b>costs.</b> This is because regions with initially higher <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> are normally associated with longer routes and those tend to have larger shares of roads in poor conditions...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{determinants}} of maritime and road <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> for Spanish exports to Poland and Turkey and investigate the different effects of these costs on international trade. First, we investigate {{the extent to which}} maritime and road <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> depend on different factors such as unit values, distances, transport conditions, service structures, and service quality. Second, we analyze the relative importance of road and maritime <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> as determinants of trade flows. The data on <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> are drawn from a new database compiled from primary data sources. The main results of this investigation identify the central variables influencing road and maritime transportation costs: for both modes, transport conditions are strong determinants, whereas efficiency and service quality are more important for maritime <b>transport</b> <b>costs,</b> and geographical distance is more important for road transport. Road and maritime <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> are important explanatory factors of exports and they seem to deter trade {{to a greater extent than}} road or maritime transit time when considered endogenously determined. <b>Transport</b> <b>costs,</b> <b>transport</b> mode, Spanish exports, international trade...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Transport</b> <b>Costs</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sources of barriers to trade. Inspired by this concern, we use an ad-hoc empirical model to examine the possible determinants of <b>transport</b> <b>costs.</b> Using a country aggregate bilateral <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> database for 1990, we replicate Limao and Venables (2001) and we find that the effect of their infras-tructure index on <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> is not robust. Following Micco (2004) and Micco and Serebrinzky (2005) we calculate two alternative indexes of infras-tructure. Using these new indexes we find that not only distance but infrastruc-ture, political stability, common bilateral ties and open sky agreements as well are other important channels through which <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> can be reduced...|$|R

[...] T. sessile has polydomous colonies, meaning that one colony has {{multiple}} nests. Because of this, T. sessile is very good at foraging for food when there is great variance in the distribution of resources. Instead of going back to a faraway nest to deliver food, they move workers, queens, and the brood to be closer to the food, so that they can reduce food <b>transport</b> <b>cost.</b> This is called 'dispersed central-place foraging'. It was also found that the nest half-life was about 12.9 days.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the opening}} of the first A11 {{motorway}} section, the project was criticized by political opposition parties as excessively expensive, citing estimated cost of 14.8 million euro per kilometer and comparing it to cost of somewhat more than 4 million euro per kilometer cost of the A1 motorway to Split. Hrvatske autoceste, operator of the motorway, defended the price as a result of unfavorable, silty ground along the route requiring large quantities of backfill and transportation of the backfill material. Furthermore, Hrvatske autoceste rejected the claims of cost per kilometer of the A11 and the A1. The company which operates both of the motorways claimed that the average price of the A1 motorway was 7.1 million euro per kilometer and that the average cost per kilometer of the A11 stands at 11.3 million euro, further citing high <b>transport</b> <b>cost</b> of the backfill material caused by remote location of the closest quarry which is approximately [...] away. Construction of the A11 motorway was also criticized as an example of interference of politics in road construction, where construction sites are perceived as generally serving as ribbon-cutting ceremony sites during election campaigns.|$|E

The home-market effect is the {{tendency}} for large countries to be net exporters of goods with high <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> and strong scale economies.

First, if congestion does not exist, at most one industry disperses when <b>transport</b> and commuting <b>costs</b> are sufficiently small. Furthermore, regional specialization occurs in which industries having higher adjusted <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> (which are defined as the ratios of <b>transport</b> <b>costs</b> to the number of varieties) than that of the dispersing industry agglomerate in one region.
