25|$|The Spanish under Hernán Cortés arrived into central Mexico. After Cortés's {{defeat in}} Tenochtitlan (La Noche <b>Triste)</b> and retreat into Tlaxacala in 1520, he sent expeditions to Morelos. One {{of the first}} Mexicas to accept Spanish {{authority}} was in Ocuituco. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the Spanish returned to Morelos to subdue the Tlahuicas in Cuernavaca in 1521, led by Gonzalo de Sandoval. However, the first attempt failed. The next attempt first took Yautepec, Oaxtepec and Jiutepec and after a fierce fight, finally took the city. He constructed the Palace of Cortés in this city five years later.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by Pánfilo de Narváez, {{to oppose}} Cortès, {{arriving}} in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men. Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan {{and took the}} rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a massacre in the Great Temple, triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects. The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the Noche <b>Triste,</b> where they managed a narrow escape while their backguard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape. After a battle in Otumba they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men. Having prevailed {{with the assistance of}} allies and reinforcements from Cuba, Cortés besieged Tenochtitlán and captured its ruler Cuauhtémoc in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, Rosenstock's {{collaborator}} {{and later}} rival Ion Vinea {{claimed that he}} was responsible for coining the Tzara part of his pseudonym in 1915. Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep Tristan as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the [...] "infamous pun" [...] <b>Triste</b> Âne Tzara (French for [...] "Sad Donkey Tzara"). This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations Tristan Țara and Tr. Tzara, in 1913-1914 (although {{there is a possibility that}} he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper).|$|E
500|$|Neville Cardus said of Sargent's Beethoven, [...] "I {{have heard}} {{performances}} which critics would have raved about had some conductor from Russia {{been responsible for}} them conducting them half as well and truthfully." [...] Sargent recorded Beethoven's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies for Decca with Sidney Beer's National Symphony Orchestra. His 1940s accompaniments for Artur Schnabel in the piano concertos have been admired. A 1961 stereo recording of the Eroica Symphony has been reissued on CD. Sargent was an enthusiastic champion of Sibelius's music, even recording it with the Vienna Philharmonic when it {{was not part of}} their repertory. Their recordings of Finlandia, En saga, The Swan of Tuonela and the Karelia Suite were issued in 1963 and reissued on CD in 1993. Sargent and the BBC recorded the first, second and fifth Symphonies in 1956 and 1958 respectively, reissued on CD in 1989, as well as Pohjola's Daughter in 1959. He also recorded the Valse <b>triste</b> with the RLPO.|$|E
500|$|The tone poem premiered on 4June 1914 at [...] "The Shed" [...] {{concert hall}} of the Norfolk Music Festival, Sibelius himself {{conducting}} at a podium decorated in the American and Finnish national colors. The orchestra, which Sibelius praised as [...] "wonderful... surpasses anything we have in Europe", comprised musicians drawn from three of America's best music societies: the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The Oceanides was unlike anything the musicians had previously encountered. [...] "I think they did not understand it all at first from what they said", Stoeckel recalled. [...] "The next morning, after having run it through three times, they were thoroughly delighted with it and remarked that {{the beauty of the}} music grew with each rehearsal". The festival public sounded a similarly positive note about the new piece, which concluded a concert of Sibelius's music that included Pohjola's Daughter, the King Christian II Suite, The Swan of Tuonela, Finlandia, and Valse <b>triste.</b> Stoeckel recounts the events of 4June: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to arrangements for solo instruments of his popular orchestral works, Ketèlbey wrote {{a range of}} music for organ and for piano. Some of the more serious of these pieces were published under his [...] "Vodorinski" [...] pen name. Among the organ works are Pastorale and Rêverie dramatique, both dating from about 1911. The piano works include the early classical pieces such as the 1888 Sonata, and shorter items in a more popular style, such as Rêverie (1894) and Les pèlerins (1925), by way of A Romantic Melody (1898), Pensées joyeuses (1888), In the Woodlands (1921), A Song of Summer (1922), and Légende <b>triste</b> (1923). The musical influences on his piano works were on the whole conservative: for the early works McCanna mentions Haydn and Mendelssohn in this context. Much of the piano music published {{in the years after}} the First World War was aimed at a domestic audience; it requires only a modest technical proficiency to play and is simple in structure with deft harmonies. The most commercially successful of the Vodorinski works was the Prelude in C minor (1907). McCanna comments that not only the title but the material is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff: [...] "the music turns out to copy some of the more illustrious composer's features, notably the final fortissimo statement of the melody in the bass". Ketèlbey followed Chopin's model in several waltzes in the key of A major, including La grâcieuse (1907) and two different pieces under the title Valse brillante (1905 and 1911).|$|E
