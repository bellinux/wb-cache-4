40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to {{estimate}} the secondary flow losses through the gap between the shrouded <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blades. Aerodynamic losses occurring in flow such as profile, secondary flow and leakage were analyzed. The numerical results of flow over a single shrouded <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blade, cascade analysis of two shrouded <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blade with zero gap and leakage analysis through the 2 mm z-gap of the shrouded <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blade are presented. First, a single shrouded <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blade was analyzed and the pressure coefficient {{on the surface of the}} blade at midsection of blade is taken as reference. For this, the geometry of a shrouded HP <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> is chosen. GAMBIT software is used for designing and analyzed using FLUENT software. Secondly cascade analysis was also carried out using the same procedure and the pressure coefficient is compared with the reference pressure coefficient profile and found that changes in the pressure coefficient on the blade surface. Finally the two shrouded <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blades with 2 mm z-gap between the shrouds are created and analyzed using the same procedure and the pressure coefficient was compared with the reference pressure coefficient profile and found that decrease in the pressure coefficient on the blade surface near the shroud is because of the leakage of flow through the z-gap between the shrouds. The leakage lessens the end wall boundary layer separation near shroud of the <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blade with 2 mm z-gap...|$|R

A typical <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> is considered for transient thermal analysis using the modeling software i. e. CAD software and ANSYS software. The <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> of a steam turbine is subjected to temperature variations in short periods of time due to the start and stop cycles of the turbine. This causes sudden changes in the temperature with transient thermal stresses being induced into the <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor.</b> The transient effects are due to the changes in the material properties like- Density, Specific heat and Youngs Modulus.

50|$|Doman, {{along with}} noted German-born {{aerospace}} engineer Kurt Hohenemser (a partner and confidant of the well-known German airplane and helicopter designer Anton Flettner), maintained that a flexible two-bladed helicopter type wind turbine rotor design that is compliant with {{the forces of}} nature was more suitable for producing electricity than the rigid industry standard three-bladed airplane type wind <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> that, by design, can only be constructed to resist {{the forces of nature}}.|$|E

50|$|Already in the mid-1990s, the D4 was {{produced}} with active pitch regulation {{as well as}} a doubly fed induction generator.

50|$|Related to {{high-performance}} sailing craft are vehicles {{powered by}} wind <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors,</b> which have wheels that are propelled by the rotor (as {{seen from a}} ground-stationary vantage point). These vehicles share a common trait with high-performance sailing craft: As the vehicle increases in speed, the advancing rotor airfoil encounters an increasing apparent wind at an angle of attack that is increasingly smaller. At the same time, such vehicles are subject to forward resistance. As a result, such vehicles are often capable of speeds exceeding that of the wind.|$|E
5000|$|Wind farms {{may affect}} weather in their {{immediate}} vicinity. This turbulence from spinning wind <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> increases vertical mixing {{of heat and}} water vapor that affects the meteorological conditions downwind, including rainfall. Overall, wind farms lead to a slight warming at night and a slight cooling during the day time. This effect can be reduced by using more efficient rotors or placing wind farms in regions with high natural turbulence. Warming at night could [...] "benefit agriculture by decreasing frost damage and extending the growing season. Many farmers already do this with air circulators".|$|E

50|$|According to the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative, east San Diego County, {{along with}} {{neighboring}} Imperial County and Northern Baja California, has a potential aggregate generating capacity of roughly 6,870 megawatts (MW) for solar energy, 3,495 MW for wind power and 2,000 MW for geothermal energy. Together, these renewable resources could potentially produce enough electricity to power 8 million homes at noon, {{on a sunny}} day, if the wind was turning windfarm <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> at their theoretical maximum speed. Given Southern California capacity factors, however, of 28% for solar and 30% for wind, production at the quoted capacity would average one-third of that, or enough to power 2,666,000 homes.|$|E
