5|$|Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) are {{designated}} by local authorities under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.

In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> until their backstories were revealed.|$|E

50|$|Shepherding was an isolated, lonely {{job that}} was firstly given to {{assigned}} convict servants.

Some shepherds were additionally brought to Australia on the ships that carried sheep and were contracted <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> on their arrival in the colony.

5|$|Wilfrid's feast day is 12 October or 24 April. Both dates were {{celebrated in}} early medieval England, but the April date {{appeared}} {{first in the}} liturgical calendars. The April date is the date when his relics were translated to a new shrine. Immediately after his death Wilfrid's body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened {{at the spot where}} the water used to wash his body was discarded. A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon. The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.|$|E

25|$|Of the Australian oncomerines, {{the bronze}} orange bug (Musgraveia sulciventris) {{is the only}} species {{unequivocally}} documented to lack maternal brooding behavior. This peculiarity might {{be connected to the}} unreliability of the food plant availability for the species (Monteith, 2011). Unlike other oncomerines who can only lay one egg clutch for the certain amount of time it takes <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> M. sulciventris can produce multiple egg clutches rapidly because females don't have <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> This allows M. sulciventris to rapidly expand their population when conditions are favorable.|$|E

25|$|In 13th century medieval Europe, {{psychiatric}} hospitals were built {{to house the}} mentally ill, but there were not any nurses <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> and treatment was rarely provided.

The insane were partnered with “soul friends” to help them reconnect with society. Their primary concern was befriending the melancholy and disturbed, forming intimate spiritual relationships. Today, these soul friends are seen as the first modern psychiatric nurses.|$|E

25|$|It is {{reported}} that the focus of China on population planning helps provide a better health service for women {{and a reduction in}} the risks of death and injury associated with pregnancy.

First, the average Chinese household expends fewer resources, both in terms of time and money, on children, which gives many Chinese people more money with which to invest.
