5|$|The <b>toothed</b> whales (systematic name Odontoceti) form a parvorder of the cetaceans. As {{the name}} suggests, the parvorder is {{characterized}} by having teeth (rather than baleen). <b>Toothed</b> whales are active hunters, feeding on fish, squid, {{and in some cases}} other marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|Pristiophoriformes: These are the sawsharks, with an elongated, <b>toothed</b> snout {{that they}} use for {{slashing}} their prey.|$|E
5|$|The ship lift's design uses a {{helical gear}} system, to climb or descend a <b>toothed</b> rack.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{replacement}} - Teeth {{are replaced}} once or (as in <b>toothed</b> whales and murid rodents) not at all, {{rather than being}} replaced continually throughout life.|$|E
5|$|Whales {{split into}} two {{separate}} parvorders around 34 mya– the baleen whales (Mysticetes) and the <b>toothed</b> whales (Odontocetes).|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} the <b>toothed</b> steel trap for {{catching}} rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (<b>toothed</b> whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small <b>toothed</b> whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, which was a very common species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early <b>toothed</b> bird, Ichthyornis.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} <b>toothed</b> whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of the bony narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{are divided}} into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), is {{characterized}} by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses to filter plankton, among others, from the water; Odontocetes (<b>toothed</b> whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.|$|E
5|$|Early species had long, fully <b>toothed</b> {{jaws and}} long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats {{made up of}} hair-like {{filaments}} known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned {{a wide range of}} adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, Arago {{suggested}} to Fizeau and Foucault that {{they attempt to}} measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, {{it appears that the}} two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment. In 1848−49, Fizeau used, not a rotating mirror, but a <b>toothed</b> wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air. In 1850, Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water. Foucault used a scaled-up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862. Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872–76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877–1931 used improved versions of the <b>toothed</b> wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in <b>toothed</b> forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Olympic Flame' is a {{form with}} {{prominent}} bracts around the flowerheads. It has large leaves with <b>toothed</b> margins and flowers in early spring. Also known as 'Sunburst', it arose as a seedling in a breeding program conducted by Cathy Offord, Peter Goodwin and Paul Nixon {{under the auspices of}} the University of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} for feeding and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the soil to either side with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, <b>toothed</b> and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while the other half remains active. This behavior was only documented in <b>toothed</b> whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, <b>toothed</b> cetaceans in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their <b>toothed</b> whale counterparts, baleen {{whales are}} hard to study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only have been heard making clicks, while <b>toothed</b> whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{hypothesised}} {{description of}} what Mesozoic ants looked like was somewhat accurate when compared to actual specimens, some characteristics were inaccurate. They believed that ant-like mandibles first appeared before {{the development of an}} ant-like petiole, but such case was proven false when it was opposite on S. freyi specimens (ant-like petiole first appeared before the development of ant-like mandibles). Based on drawings, it was suggested that Mesozoic ants had long mandibles with multiple teeth, <b>toothed</b> tarsal claws and a broadly jointed petiole. Examination of collected specimens, however, shows that these ants had very short mandibles, toothless tarsal claws and a separated petiole.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales (systematic name Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from <b>toothed</b> whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are <b>toothed</b> whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to <b>toothed</b> whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} <b>toothed</b> tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form <b>toothed</b> gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's <b>toothed</b> wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large <b>toothed</b> gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, such as when Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E
5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and <b>toothed</b> whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E
5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's <b>toothed</b> mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be yawning. Its mouth is open to a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from behind its lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine <b>toothed</b> animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly in the jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. <b>Toothed</b> whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are <b>toothed</b> and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the leaf blade is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped leaf blade, more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|Larger Eolambia {{would have}} been {{vulnerable}} to the large neovenatorid theropod Siats, which was discovered by expeditions from the FMNH. A variety of smaller maniraptoran theropods are also present in the Mussentuchit, which would have functioned as scavengers; their remains include teeth attributed to the Dromaeosauridae, Paronychodon, and Richardoestesia. As for herbivorous dinosaurs, the nodosaurid Animantarx was discovered in Carol's Site, near the type specimen of Eolambia. Teeth belonging to more basal ornithopods have also been discovered, with similar teeth having been referred to the Pachycephalosauria or to <b>toothed</b> birds by Cifelli in 1999. More complete remains referred to two different ornithopods – an orodromine and a basal iguanodont – remain unpublished. A giant oviraptorosaur has also been discovered, alongside teeth from ceratopsians and sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear <b>toothed,</b> and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could be mistaken for a small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate by sex, vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), <b>toothed</b> whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E
5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species. The pinnae of Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi) are <b>toothed</b> and less deeply cut, and the dark color of the stipe continues partway up the rachis in that species. Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, the blade of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of the blade are not as deeply cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
