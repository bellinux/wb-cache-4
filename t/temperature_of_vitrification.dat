50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, the Cryonics Institute {{obtained}} custom-built computer-controlled cooling boxes, with LabVIEW software which would allow controlled cooling to a temperature as low as −192 °C (−313 °F). This equipment was necessary for effective application <b>of</b> <b>vitrification,</b> because cooling should be {{as fast as possible}} prior to the solidification <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vitrification</b> mixture (about −125 °C), but cooling should be very slow below that temperature to reduce cracking due to thermal stress.|$|R
40|$|We employ fast {{scanning}} calorimetry (FSC) {{to characterize}} the glass transition of polystyrene (PS) nanospheres. We observe suppression of the glass transition temperature (Tg) in comparison to bulk PS, both in terms <b>of</b> limiting fictive <b>temperature</b> (Tf) and <b>temperature</b> range <b>of</b> <b>vitrification.</b> At the same time, the polymer molecular mobility {{is found to be}} independent of the nanospheres diameter and bulk-like. Importantly, apart from the fact that this result has been obtained on the same samples and experiments and at comparable time scales, in all cases, a perturbation of the entropy is induced. Hence, to understand these results, the conceptual difference between vitrification kinetics and molecular mobility is highlighted. The main consequence of the outcome of the present study is that arguments beyond those based on the modification of the molecular mobility must be accounted for to explain Tg suppression in polymer glasses subjected to nanoscale confinement...|$|R
40|$|To characterise a polymer, {{it is of}} {{fundamental}} importance to determine its parameters, like the <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> destruction, <b>vitrification,</b> melting point, specific mass losses or polymorphic transformations, which frequently determine {{the quality of the}} product and its applications. Thermal analyses were conducted of samples of a biopolymer binder: a starch-poly(acrylic acid) composition and a moulding sand with a biopolymer binder previously hardened with microwaves. In order to determine the thermal stability of the examined samples by determining the destruction temperature and the thermal effects of transformations taking place during heating, FTIR spectroscopy and thermal analysis (DSC, DTG, TG) methods were used. In addition, volatile products of degradation were analysed using the thermogravimetry (TG) method coupled online with mass spectrometry (MS). These examinations were also aimed at identifying the changes that can take place in the moulding sand when it comes into contact with liquid metal...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{reactive}} solvents which reversibly (de) polymerise {{to facilitate}} the processing of poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene ether) (PPE) was explored. PPE can be dissolved at elevated temperatures in very low molecular weight thermoplastic poly(urethane) (TPU) fragments obtained via depolymerisation and these solutions can then be processed at the relatively low <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> 250 degreesC. After processing and upon cooling, the TPU fragments repolymerise which induces a L-L phase separation between PPE and TPU followed by <b>vitrification</b> <b>of</b> the PPE matrix phase and at lower <b>temperatures</b> <b>vitrification</b> <b>of</b> the TPU dispersed phase. Since phase separation occurs during cooling, the phase separation is induced thermally as well as chemically, since the molecular weight of the 'solvent' increases upon lowering the <b>temperature.</b> The properties <b>of</b> the final materials, such as heat resistance, are dominated by the continuous PPE matrix. The starting molecular weight of TPU and {{the composition of the}} blend had pronounced effects on the phase separation, morphology and viscosity of the blends. Increasing the amount of TPU resulted in larger TPU particles but no effect on the T-g of the PPE-rich matrix was observed. Increasing the starting molecular weight of TPU resulted in higher phase separation temperatures and higher T(g) s for the PPE-rich matrix. Possibilities for diminishing the residual TPU fractions were explored. The interference <b>of</b> <b>vitrification</b> with phase separation could be postponed and, consequently, the residual fraction of TPU in the PPE phase could be reduced either via an increase in the starting molecular weight of TPU or a decrease in cooling rate or T-g of the matrix...|$|R

Unsatisfactory experimental results with conventional techniques prompted us to explore the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>vitrification.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{the present study was to}} optimize the heat exchange between the corneal tissue and cooling medium by reducing the corneal tissue volume and using a suitable sample container. A further objective was to promote vitrification by developing a new device for rapid cooling to - 140 degreesC, just below the <b>vitrification</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the cryopreservation medium. Experiments were done using posterior lamellar discs from pig corneas with a diameter of 7. 5 mm and a thickness of 250 - 350 mum. The volume of tissue to be vitrified was 88 % lower with posterior corneal lamellae than with the previously used corneoscleral discs.

Despite the successful vitrification, only a maximum of 10 % of the endothelial cells was vital after warming.
