5|$|The Canterbury {{region was}} hit by a series of {{earthquake}}s, and the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake damaged the office building beyond repair. About 400 people worked in the building before the earthquakes. Following the earthquakes, the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) was set up to manage <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,000power {{workers from}} eight {{different}} states {{went to the}} worst hit areas to help restore power. Seven states sent tree trimmers to help clear debris from power lines and roads to speed <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, FEMA gave SLEMCO, the state's power company, an $8.6million grant, which paid for 75% of {{the damage to the}} electrical grid there. It took up to four weeks to restore power to all customers.|$|E
40|$|In this lecture, it was {{discussed}} <b>the</b> long-term <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> with three goals to achieve {{based on the}} research results obtained from <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> following <b>the</b> 1995 Kobe earthquake. A three tier model of long-term recovery was introduced with the following three goals: 1) Physical recovery, 2) Economic recovery, and 3) Life recovery...|$|R

30|$|The first {{fundamental}} step in {{the processes}} of remanufacturing, recycling, and disposing of EOL products is product disassembly. This pertinent operation is the method of deconstructing an EOL product down to its core mechanical components by utilizing either non-destructive, semi-destructive, or destructive techniques. The disassembly supports <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> which are necessary to minimize dependency on processes that lead to natural resource depletion.|$|R
5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 2000s, {{specialist}} saw the benefit of using SGDs not only for adults but for children, as well. Neuro-linguists found that SGDs were just as effective in helping children who were at risk for temporary language deficits after undergoing brain surgery {{as it is for}} patients with ALS. In particular, digitized SGDs have been used as communication aids for pediatric patients during <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, slowing <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following a failure of the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula One session during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E
40|$|Counting rate {{is a key}} {{parameter}} of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD) and {{is determined}} by <b>the</b> current <b>recovery</b> time of an SNSPD after a detection event. We propose a new method to study the transient detection efficiency (DE) and pulse amplitude during <b>the</b> current <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> by statistically analyzing the single photon response of an SNSPD under photon illumination with a high repetition rate. The transient DE results match well with the DEs deduced from the static current dependence of DE combined with the waveform of a single-photon detection event. This proves that the static measurement results {{can be used to}} analyze <b>the</b> transient current <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> after a detection event. The results are relevant for understanding <b>the</b> current <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> of SNSPDs after a detection event and for determining the counting rate of SNSPDs.

30|$|We forced {{failures}} in the spontaneous networks with <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>processes.</b> This allowed us to observe the network behavior when there are physical topology changes and node failures. Failures and recoveries usually happen {{in these kinds of}} networks, so we wished to study how a network-level protocol works when those events occur. Those errors always take place in the weak nodes (the most stable ones are the gateway node and the web server).|$|R
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests from one country would be used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model was used to simulate <b>the</b> groundwater <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> under various surface mining situations. The simulation results were used to predict {{the rate at which}} soil settlement takes place. It was found that <b>the</b> groundwater <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> is very fast immediately after mine closure and cessation of dewatering programmes; a significant part of mine land settlement can be measured at such times. This paper presents a method for deriving the relationship between the re-establishment of the natural groundwater regime to its equilibrium position as existed prior to the commencement of mining operations and mine spoil settlement...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the self {{purification}} capacity of River Atuwara {{was done with the}} aim of developing a reaeration coefficient model, k 2, for the river. The k 2 model was evaluated and validated by comparing its performance with the Streeter-Phelps and Agunwamba models. Atuwara model was developed using non-linear regression while its performance was checked by the use of statistical and graphical parameters. The model gave the best dissolved oxygen predictive capacity in comparison with other models when used with the modified Streeter-Phelps equation in spite of the limitations imposed on it by the sinusoidal shape of <b>the</b> dissolved oxygen <b>recovery</b> curve caused by frequent interruptions in <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> of <b>the</b> river system. It is also of note that due to its importance to human and aquatic life sustenance, <b>the</b> natural <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> of River Atuwara from frequent pollution loads could only be enhanced through an effective monitoring and regulation of effluent discharges into it by the Ogun State Environmental Protection Agency...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{animal and}} human studies have {{suggested}} that the cuprizone (CPZ, a copper chelator) -fed C 57 BL/ 6 mouse may be used as an animal model of schizophrenia. The goals of this study were to see <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>processes</b> of CPZ-induced behavioral changes and damaged white matter and to examine possible effects of antipsychotic drugs on <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>processes.</b> Mice were fed a CPZ-containing diet for 5 [*]weeks then returned to normal food for 3 [*]weeks, during which period mice were treated with different antipsychotic drugs. Various behaviors were measured at the end of CPZ-feeding phase {{as well as on the}} 14 th and 21 st days after CPZ withdrawal. The damage to and recovery status of white matter in the brains of mice were examined. Dietary CPZ resulted in white matter damage and behavioral abnormalities in the elevated plus-maze (EPM), social interaction (SI), and Y-maze test. EPM performance recovered to normal range within 2 [*]weeks after CPZ withdrawal. Alterations in SI showed no recovery. Antipsychotics did not alter animals’ behavior in either of these tests during <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> period. Altered performance in the Y-maze showed some <b>recovery</b> in <b>the</b> vehicle group; atypical antipsychotics, but not haloperidol, significantly promoted this <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> <b>recovery</b> of damaged white matter was incomplete during <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> period. None of the drugs significantly promoted <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> of damaged white matter. These results suggest that CPZ-induced white matter damage and SI deficit may be resistant to the antipsychotic treatment employed in this study. They are in good accordance with the clinical observations that positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients respond well to antipsychotic drugs while social dysfunction is usually intractable...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the problem}} of wrong {{notification}} of route failure arises because of channel contention. In IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, {{when the number of}} attempts for medium access exceeds a specified limit, the sender assumes that the receiver is out of range and stops its transmission attempts. The MAC protocol notifies the upper layer that the path is unavailable, and the upper layer starts a route recovery procedure [15]. At this stage, TCP stops transmission, and throughput becomes zero during <b>the</b> route <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> Moreover, if <b>the</b> route <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> takes longer than the RTO, then there will be unnecessary activation of TCP congestion control.|$|R
40|$|Phase {{transformation}} tensor Ω in the {{constitutive equation}} proposed by Tanaka has been evaluated by employing experimental data of TiNi alloys in a constrained <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> It {{demonstrates that the}} absolute value of Ω for <b>the</b> constrained <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> is typically about 0. 6 ~ 0. 7 x 103 MPa, which is much smaller than that for the stress - induced martensitic transformation (typically 2. 5 ~ 3. 5 x 103). Based on the evaluated results for Ω, predicted recovery stress - temperature relations by the constitutive equation are compared with the experimental data for TiNi rods under different strains. Big discrepancy exists for large strain conditions. Several transformation kinetic expressions are examined for the constitutive relation of <b>the</b> constrained <b>recovery</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

25|$|This process {{includes}} several steps such as filtration, evaporation, drying, grinding, and sifting. These operations are concentration-dependent and also {{dependent on the}} particular gelatin used. Gelatin degradation should be avoided and minimized, so the lowest temperature possible is used for <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process.</b> Most recoveries are rapid, {{with all of the}} processes being done in several stages to avoid extensive deterioration of the peptide structure. A deteriorated peptide structure would result in a low gel strength, which is not generally desired.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>process</b> for the ACL {{is usually}} {{broken down into}} {{different}} phases of rehabilitation.

Timelines are sometimes given to help give an idea of where one can be during rehabilitation. Timeline are not used to discourage or encourage those who aren’t ready to advance their recovery process. Such acts may cause serious injury or re-injury of the ACL.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} {{districts were}} formed: The {{town and the}} city. The town, an ancient site, was surrounded with the castrum of the episcopal chateau built on the Rock. The two neighbourhoods functioned as two independent entities {{from each other and}} from their inception. The town remained {{under the supervision of the}} provost of the chapter while the city or castrum was of the bishop.
