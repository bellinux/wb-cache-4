5|$|On caste, he {{believed}} that the Kural illustrates how Vedic laws of Manu were against the Sudras and other communities of the Dravidian race. On the other hand, Periyar opined that the ethics from the Kural was comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Bible. The Dravidar Kazhagam adopted the Thirukkural and advocated that Thiruvalluvar's Kural alone was enough to educate the people of the country.|$|E
5|$|The Peasant Popular Union and Social Democrats {{formed a}} left-wing {{coalition}} in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Democrats.

5|$|Vizzini is {{the central}} {{character}} {{in the history of}} direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. After World War II he became the personification of the reinstatement of Cosa Nostra during the Allied occupation and the subsequent restoration of democracy after the repression under Fascist rule.

5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> faith in Tripura dates back many centuries. Fr.

Barbe, the Pastor of Chittagong, visited Tripura in 1843. Holy Cross pioneering missionaries Fr. Louis Augustine Verite and Fr.

5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> faith but often it does.|$|E

Notably, the future Archbishop of Canterbury and {{chaplain}} to King CharlesII, John Tillotson, preached his first sermon at the church in 1661. Major restoration work was done to the church in 1886, and a large amount of the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. The church has been a Grade II* listed building since 1955, and is the oldest building in the village by more than six centuries.|$|E
5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund. Although initially influential, these two groups soon lost most of their voters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Social Party and the Social Democratic Party. Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Dynastic alliances bound Æthelwold's kingdom {{strongly}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> {{kingdom of}} Kent, where Seaxburh, the eldest daughter of Æthelwold's elder brother Anna, was Eorcenberht of Kent's queen. East Anglia's western stronghold in the Fens {{was held by}} Seaxburh's sister Æthelthryth and, like Kent, it was devoutly attached to the Roman Church. There was also an important Northumbrian connection: in 657, Hilda established the monastery of Streoneshalh (identified with Whitby), which later became the burial-place of Edwin and other Northumbrian kings. Hilda's sister Hereswitha married Æthelwold's youngest brother Æthelric in around 627–629.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, {{and using}} it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were not married, the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona's 33-year reign was {{characterized}} by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the Kingdom of Imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of Madagascar. These policies were enacted {{in a context of}} increasing European influence within her kingdom and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first putting an end to a friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> religion. In 1835 she forbade the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population, and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory.|$|E
5|$|The History of Yuan (chapter 134) {{records that}} a certain Ai-sie (transliteration of either Joshua or Joseph) from the country of Fu lin (i.e. the Byzantine Empire), {{initially}} {{in the service of}} Güyük Khan, was well-versed in Western languages and had expertise in the fields of medicine and astronomy that convinced Kublai Khan to offer him a position as the director of medical and astronomical boards. Kublai Khan eventually honored him with the title of Prince of Fu lin (Chinese: 拂菻王; Fú lǐn wáng). His biography in the History of Yuan lists his children by their Chinese names, which are similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> names Elias (Ye-li-ah), Luke (Lu-ko), and Antony (An-tun), with a daughter named A-na-si-sz.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Vlaams Blok was the People's Union, {{which was}} founded in 1954 as the successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Flemish People's Union electoral alliance, that had successfully run for election earlier the same year. The party had been careful to choose its leaders from nationalist circles that had not collaborated with the Nazis. While Flemish separatists had been suspicious of the People's Union since its outset, it became clear by the 1970s that the party had moved to a moderate left-liberal course, which led to the defection of its more radical members. The remaining nationalist hardliners finally rejected the party's participation in a new five-party government coalition in 1977, and particularly the Egmont pact, believing it had conceded too much to the francophone government parties.|$|E
