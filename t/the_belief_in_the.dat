5|$|Buddhism {{arrived in}} Japan in the mid–6th century Asuka period, and was officially {{adopted in the}} wake of the Battle of Shigisan in 587, after which Buddhist temples began to be constructed. The new {{religion}} and customs fundamentally transformed Japanese society and the arts. Funerary traditions such as cremation and the practice of placing epitaphs in graves were imported from China and Korea. Following the treatment of Buddhist relics, the cremated remains in a glass container were wrapped in a cloth and placed in an outer container. Epitaphs, which recorded the lives of the deceased on silver or bronze rectangular strips, were particularly popular from the latter half of the 7th to the end of the 8th century (late Asuka and Nara period). Four epitaphs and a number of cinerary urns and reliquaries containing bones have been designated as National Treasures. Other archaeological National Treasures from the Buddhist era include ritual items buried in the temple foundations of the Golden Halls of Tōdai-ji and Kōfuku-ji in Nara. According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, the world would enter a dark period in 1051; consequently in the late Heian period <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saving powers of Maitreya or Miroku, the Buddha to be, became widespread. Believers buried scriptures and images to gain merit and to prepare for the coming Buddha. This practice, which continued into the Kamakura period, required the transcription of sutras according to strict ritual protocols, their placement in protective reliquary containers and burial in the earth of sacred mountains, shrines or temples to await the future Buddha. The oldest known sutra mound is that of Fujiwara no Michinaga from 1007 on Mount Kinpu, who buried one lotus sutra and five other sutras that he had written in 998. Its sutra container has been designated as National Treasure.|$|E

25|$|The rise of Christianity saw {{an end to}} cremation, being {{influenced}} by its roots in Judaism, <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resurrection of the body, and following the example of Christ's burial.

25|$|In Judaism, {{the main}} textual source for <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end {{of days and}} {{accompanying}} events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. In the Five Books of Moses (the Torah), references are made in Deuteronomy 28-31, that the Jews {{will not be able}} to keep the Laws of Moses in the Land of Israel and will be subsequently exiled but ultimately redeemed. The books of the Hebrew Prophets elaborated and prophesied about the end of days.|$|E
25|$|Broadly defined, Religious Zionism is a {{movement}} that embraces the idea of Jewish national sovereignty, often in connection with <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ability of the Jewish people {{to bring about a}} redemptive state through natural means, and often attributing religious significance to the modern State of Israel. (This attitude is rejected by most Haredim – but not all, particularly the Hardal movement.) Thus, in this sense, Religious Zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including Modern Orthodoxy.|$|E
25|$|The culture-comparative {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} objects placed on domestic thresholds often bear the function of an amulet repelling the broadly understood evil. In fact, the early Rabbinic sources explicitly witness <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anti-demonic function of mezuzah. This {{is the case in}} e.g. JT Megillah 4:12; BT Bava Metziya 102a; BT Pesahim 113b. The further analysis of the biblical and rabbinic texts (inter alia Deuteronomy 6, 11, Exodus 12, Mekhilta de-rabbi Ishmael 7,12 and BT Menahot 33b, 43b) shows that mezuzah is construed as a device protecting against the divine anger.|$|E

25|$|The first, which {{retained}} {{currency in}} Greek theological and mystical speculation until {{the dissolution of}} the empire, was <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> angelic transmission of sacred chant: the assumption that the early Church united men in the prayer of the angelic choirs. It was partly based on the Hebrew fundament of Christian worship, but in the particular reception of St. Basil of Caesarea's divine liturgy. John Chrysostom, since 397 Archbishop of Constantinople, abridged the long formular of Basil's divine liturgy for the local cathedral rite.|$|E
25|$|Spiritualists {{reacted with}} an {{uncertainty}} to {{the theories of}} evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time however, <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> animal origins of humanity threatened {{the foundation of the}} immortality of the spirit, for if humans had not been created by God, it was scarcely plausible that they would be specially endowed with spirits. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.|$|E
25|$|Scholars such as Ulrich Luz and {{separately}} Dale Allison {{view the}} pericope as instrumental in asserting the divinity of Jesus among early Christians. Alan Robinson sees the pericope {{as important in}} establishing <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Church that the disciples viewed Jesus as the Son of God. Dale Allison states that Matthew's presentation emphasizes that God the Father is willing to share divine power with his son and {{that the impact of}} this pericope on the affirmation of the divinity of Jesus in the ecumenical creeds is undeniable.|$|E

Most 21st century Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants do not hold millennialist beliefs, but they remain strong among American evangelicals. A central role in the end-time drama is given to the figure of the Antichrist: opposed to God and his plan, he is either or both a military/political enemy and/or a deceiver who seeks to lead the faithful from Christ.|$|E
25|$|Individuals could {{interact}} with the gods for their own purposes, appealing for their help through prayer or compelling them to act through magic. These practices were distinct from, but closely linked with, the formal rituals and institutions. The popular religious tradition grew more prominent {{in the course of}} Egyptian history as the status of the Pharaoh declined. Another important aspect was <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife and funerary practices. The Egyptians made great efforts to ensure the survival of their souls after death, providing tombs, grave goods, and offerings to preserve the bodies and spirits of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|Nineteenth-century evangelicals were {{fascinated with}} biblical prophecy as it related to future events, {{and they also}} {{promoted}} Christian Zionism, <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> restoration of the Jews to Palestine. The London Society for Promotion of Christianity Amongst the Jews (now the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People) was created in 1809. In the 1830s, the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, a leading evangelical, helped persuade Lord Palmerston, the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to sponsor Jewish settlement. In 1841, Edward Bickersteth published The Restoration of the Jews to Their Own Land and the Final Blessedness of the Earth.|$|E
