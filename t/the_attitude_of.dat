40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to examine}} the influence of a clinical practice on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> diploma nursing students toward the elderly. A pretest-posttest approach, using Kogan's Old People Scale, provided data on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students upon entry to the diploma nursing program, and the effect of a clinical practice on those attitudes. A comparison was made of the effect of a clinical practice in special care homes and in acute care institutions on <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students toward the elderly and the demographic characteristics was made. The demographic characteristics examined were age, level of education, previous social contact with the elderly, previous work or volunteer experience with the elderly, religiosity and location <b>of</b> residence. <b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing students upon entry to the nursing program were found to be positive. Of the 181 respondents to the pretest, 98. 3 % had positive <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>the</b> elderly according to the Kogan's Old People Scale. No significant change in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly was found following the clinical practice. There was no significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students who had a clinical practice in a special care home and those who had a clinical practice in an acute care institution. A significant difference in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly was found according to age of the student and the previous social contact the student had had with the elderly. As the age and the amount of social contact with the elderly increased <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students toward the elderly became more positive. However, students who had lived with an elderly person were less positive in their <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>the</b> elderly. Recommendations for further research were made based on the findings of the study and the research methodology used in this study.

Complaints about <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 percent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> the United States {{was also}} {{influenced}} by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region.

The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The classic view of Domitian {{is usually}} negative, {{since most of}} the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had {{notoriously}} difficult relations. Furthermore, contemporary historians such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets Martial and Statius constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.|$|E
5|$|In September {{questions}} were asked in the House of Commons about the incident, by which time Constantine had decided to take legal action. In June 1944 Constantine v Imperial London Hotels was heard in the High Court. Although there was no law against racial discrimination in Britain at the time, Constantine argued that the hotel had breached its contract with him. Constantine informed the court that <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> the hotel changed between his booking and arrival, owing {{to the presence of}} white American servicemen. The defence argued that they had met their contract by accommodating Constantine in another hotel and that he had left the Imperial voluntarily. The managing director of the hotel denied that racist language had been used. After two days of evidence, the judge found in Constantine's favour, rejecting the defence's arguments and praising the way Constantine had handled the situation. Although the law limited the award of damages against the hotel to five guineas, Constantine was vindicated. He did not pursue the case any further as he believed he had sufficiently raised the issue of racism in the public eye; the case was widely reported in the press, and Constantine received great support from both the public and the government.|$|E

5|$|The {{planning}} began mid-July, 1919. At {{the time}} Poland signed a ceasefire in the Polish–Ukrainian War; Lithuania was invaded by the Bermontians {{from the north}} and the Saxon Volunteers were leaving the Lithuanian Army. Piłsudski was planning to use a network of the Polish Military Organization (PMO), an underground organization he created during World War I for diversionary and intelligence operations-like purposes. On July 31, Piłsudski and Polish diplomat Leon Wasilewski arrived at Vilnius, then controlled by Poland. Piłsudski's visit had no clear explanation. He later said that he arrived to negotiate with Lithuanians, led by Augustinas Voldemaras, while Lithuanian historian Vytautas Lesčius suggests he was holding talks with pro-Polish estate owners from the Vilnius Region. On August 3, Wasilewski arrived at Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, to negotiate with Prime Minister Mykolas Sleževičius. The Polish mission declared that Poland had no plans to annex Lithuania and proposed a plebiscite in the contested territories, allowing local inhabitants to determine their future. The Lithuanians replied that the disputed territories were an integral part of Lithuania and rejected the idea of a plebiscite. Negotiations broke down and Wasilewski left Kaunas on August 7. The negotiations were then used to evaluate viability of the coup, the preparedness of the PMO, and <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> Lithuanian diplomats towards a union with Poland.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwulf {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 825, when Egbert won the crucial Battle of Ellandun against King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending the long Mercian ascendancy over southern England. Egbert followed {{it up by}} sending Æthelwulf with Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. Æthelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of Surrey, Sussex and Essex, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Egbert acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester, and Æthelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance, Æthelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Egbert and Æthelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> the new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester, {{and according to the}} historian of Anglo-Saxon England Simon Keynes, Egbert and Æthelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, the medievalist Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. Æthelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia.|$|E
