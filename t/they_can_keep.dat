The show's costume designer Catherine Ashton announced via Twitter that the third season will reportedly end with some closure and a big cliffhanger.|$|E
25|$|The losers pay {{the winning}} player points based on several {{criteria}} {{and depending on}} whether the game is for fun or for money. How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the amount of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules.|$|E

25|$|Star Fleet Battles is a ship-to-ship warfare {{simulation}} game, {{which uses}} cardboard counters {{to represent the}} ships, shuttles, seeking weapons, terrain, and information on a hexagonal map. It {{is not simply a}} game, but rather a detailed game system for two or more players (there are some solitaire scenarios). Typically, a player will have one ship in a game, though they can control an entire fleet, if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> track of the paperwork and options involved; multiple players can play as teams, with each team splitting up the work of running a squadron or fleet, or a 'free-for-all' fight can be run. Ships represented in the game are typically starships from such classic Star Trek powers as the Federation, Romulan Star Empire, Klingon Empire, or purely Star Fleet Universe creations such as the Hydran Kingdom or Interstellar Concordium.|$|E

Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E

500|$|Price called Sunset Overdrive {{the biggest}} game the studio had worked on. As {{it was the}} first open world game {{developed}} by Insomniac they had to deploy new design and development skills to produce it. The time and resources needed to develop the game also expanded significantly. While developing the game's world, the team broke it down into 10 to 11 hexes and zones. They are classified into three different types: low resolution zones, shadow zones, and mission zones, and they overlap each other so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> all zones loaded at the same time. Sunset City had three different iterations. In the early stages, it was called Greenlight City, based on Burbank, California. This version of the city featured interior structures that could be explored by players, and existed when the game's core concept revolved around [...] "scavenge, craft, defend". This city was replaced with [...] "Razor City" [...] when skateboarding, which later became oil slicks and trampolines, was introduced to the game. Razor City was [...] "Neo-Tokyo"-styled, but was later replaced by Sunset City which was more organized. While designing the game's artificial intelligence, the team thought that the game's enemies must force players to use the traversal system while simultaneously engaging in combat with them. Because of the game's vertical design, the enemies were designed to adopt the game's vertical map-design. The team also developed a “nav position tracker”, which programmed these enemies to detect the location of players and find an ambush point.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{criticism}} of alleged non-human creation of crop circles {{is that while}} evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to {{be the work of}} human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be [...] "the real thing", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, like Bower and Chorley and tabloid Today hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4's Equinox hoaxing Terence Meaden, or a friend of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1997 book , Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>keep</b> believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. Scientific American published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991.

He reported on [...] "expert" [...] sources such as The Wall Street Journal, who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained.
