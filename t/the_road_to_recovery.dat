The team of presidents Amyot, Deschot and Dewailly all struggled to compete with the top teams in the country.

25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>recovery,</b> thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
25|$|The 2012–13 season saw a {{more stable}} squad than had been seen by Grimsby Town in recent years, {{with a total of}} 12 players from the {{previous}} season's squad remaining. The previous season's top scorer Liam Hearn suffered an Achilles tendon injury in pre-season, and although he appeared to be on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> when he came on as a substitute against Stockport County, just three days later he injured his leg in training, and tests showed it was an Achilles tendon rupture and he would be out for several months. However, despite the loss of such an important player, and despite not winning 5 games into the season, Grimsby were top of the table by Christmas, with two crucial loan players Ross Hannah and Scott Neilson breathing new life into the Grimsby team. The turn of the year, however, appeared to be a turning point for Grimsby, with Nathan Pond returning from loan to Fleetwood Town and Scott Neilson signing for league rivals Luton Town. The team appeared to lack the quality they had shown {{towards the end of the}} previous year, and despite not losing until mid-February, a run of 4 consecutive losses in March saw them give up the top spot and ultimately fall away from the title race. Despite this, they reached the FA Trophy final, where they played Wrexham at Wembley Stadium on 24 March 2013. Grimsby went ahead in the second half with 20 minutes left to go, through an Andy Cook strike. However, they conceded a penalty with 9 minutes left and Wrexham equalised. This took the game to extra time, and then penalties, where Grimsby lost the shoot-out 4–1. Grimsby finished the season in good form, with a 9 match unbeaten run, finishing the season with a 3–0 win against Newport County. This led them to finish in 4th place with 83 points. They faced Newport County again straight away in the play-off semi-finals, where they were knocked out by a 1–0 loss in both legs. The managerial duo was broken up on 6 September 2013 due to Rob Scott being suspended and Paul Hurst was placed in sole charge of the team.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are various}} {{explanations}} for Rasputin's ability, {{such as that}} Rasputin hypnotized Alexei, administered herbs to him, or that his advice to the Tsarina {{not to let the}} doctors bother Alexei too much aided the boy's healing. Others speculated that, with the information he got from his confidante at the court, lady-in-waiting Anna Vyrubova, Rasputin timed his interventions for when Alexei was on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>recovery</b> anyway, and claimed all the credit. [...] Court physician Botkin believed that Rasputin was a charlatan and his apparent healing powers arose from his use of hypnosis, but Rasputin was not interested in this practice before 1913 and his teacher Gerasim Papandato was expelled from St. Petersburg. Felix Yusupov, one of Rasputin's enemies, suggested that he secretly drugged Alexei with Tibetan herbs which he got from quack doctor Peter Badmayev, but these drugs were politely rejected by the court. For Maria Rasputin, it was magnetism. For Greg King, these explanations fail to take into account those times when Rasputin healed the boy, despite being 2600km (1650 miles) away. For Fuhrmann, these ideas on hypnosis and drugs flourished because the Imperial Family lived such isolated lives. (They lived almost as much apart from Russian society as if they were settlers in Canada.) For Moynahan, [...] "There is no evidence that Rasputin ever summoned up spirits, or felt the need to; he won his admirers through force of personality, not by tricks." [...] For Shelley, the secret of his power lay in the sense of calm, gentle strength, and shining warmth of conviction.
