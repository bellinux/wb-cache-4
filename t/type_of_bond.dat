So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, Norwood, it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

2500|$|Diborane {{adopts a}} D2h {{structure}} containing four terminal and two bridging hydrogen atoms. The model determined by molecular orbital theory {{indicates that the}} bonds between boron and the terminal hydrogen atoms are conventional 2-center, 2-electron covalent bonds. The bonding between the boron atoms and the bridging hydrogen atoms is, however, different from that in molecules such as hydrocarbons. Having used two electrons in bonding to the terminal hydrogen atoms, each boron has one valence electron remaining for additional bonding. The bridging hydrogen atoms provide one electron each. Thus the B2H2 ring is held together by four electrons, an example of 3-center 2-electron bonding. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> is sometimes called a 'banana bond'. The lengths of the B-Hbridge bonds and the B-Hterminal bonds are 1.33 and 1.19 Å respectively, and this difference in the lengths of these bonds reflects the difference in their strengths, the B-Hbridge bonds being relatively weaker. [...] The weakness of the B-Hbridge vs B-Hterminal bonds is indicated by their vibrational signatures in the infrared spectrum, being ~2100 and 2500cm−1, respectively. The structure is isoelectronic with C2H62+, which would arise from the diprotonation of the planar molecule ethene.H62+ and Its Silicon Analogues Si2H62+ and CSiH62+ | pmid = 16838949 | doi = 10.1021/jp0404652 }} Diborane {{is one of many}} compounds with such unusual bonding.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} inflation-indexed bonds, {{fixed-income}} securities {{linked to a}} specific price index. The most common examples are US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and UK Index Linked Gilts. The interest and principal repayments under this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> are adjusted in line with a Consumer Price Index (in the US this is the CPI-U for urban consumers). This means that these bonds are guaranteed to outperform the inflation rate (unless (a) the market price has increased so that the [...] "real" [...] yield is negative, which {{is the case in}} 2012 for many such UK bonds, or (b) the government or other issuer defaults on the bond). This allows investors of all types to preserve the purchasing power of their money even at times of high inflation. For example, assuming 3.88% inflation over the course of 1 year (just about the 56 year average inflation rate, through most of 2006), and a real yield of 2.61% (the fixed US Treasury real yield on October 19, 2006, for a 5 yr TIPS), the adjusted principal of the fixed income would rise from 100 to 103.88 and then the real yield would be applied to the adjusted principal, meaning 103.88 x 1.0261, which equals 106.5913; giving a total return of 6.5913%. TIPS moderately outperform conventional US Treasuries, which yielded just 5.05% for a 1 yr bill on October 19, 2006.|$|E

40|$|Objectives : This {{experimental}} study evaluated the effect <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> application {{time on the}} microshear <b>bond</b> strength <b>of</b> composite resin to different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> glass ionomer cements (GICs). Materials and Methods: One-hundred and sixty specimens (two conventional and two resin-modified GICs) were prepared and divided into 16 groups. The surface of all specimens was prepared using two different bonding systems (Frog and Stea) at three different times. After setting, the composite resin (Z 100) was placed over the GICs. The specimens were then stored in distilled water for 24 hours (37 oC) and exposed to microshear stresses at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The results were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (P˂ 0. 05). Results: In conventional GICs, bond strength was affected by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> system at different times, and bond strength was significantly higher in the Fuji II group compared to Riva Self Cure group. In the Riva Self Cure group, bond strength was significantly affected by time; whereas, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> system failed to exert {{a significant effect on}} bond strength. There was no significant correlation between the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> system and the two brands <b>of</b> resin-modified GICs. <b>Bond</b> strength was not affected by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> agent; however, among the two brands of resin-modified GICs, Fuji II LC yielded a significantly stronger bond. Conclusion: It appears that the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> agent does not affect the microshear bond strength, and the bonding application time affects the microshear bond strength in Riva Self Cure GICs. </p...|$|R
