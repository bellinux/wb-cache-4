50|$|In 2014 Finnish {{state was}} {{planning}} to reduce local municipal income from wind power by taking half of the <b>tax</b> <b>income</b> <b>to</b> the state (tax of real estate). This is suggested since state is afraid that the wind power market is overheated in Finland in 2014. There is in total 448 MW wind power in start of 2014. The reduced tax is aimed to low interest in wind power investments in the municipalities. According to MTV News the wind power industry protested saying that the national wind power targets will unlikely be achieved.

The King of Denmark John (reigned 1481-1513) was not accepted in the union countries, and the councils took power into their own hands. In 1483 Sten Sture received power over three counties in Finland: Vyborg, Savonlinna and Hämeenlinna. The former realm of the Axelssons became the regent's support area and Finland became an even more integral part of the central government; especially as even Raseborg came to the power of Sten Sture's supporter Knut Posse. Sture did not distribute the castles to the nobility, but ruled over them through officials dependent on him, gathering a significant amount of <b>tax</b> <b>income</b> <b>to</b> himself.|$|E

40|$|The income {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a product measures the responsiveness of demand for the product {{to a change in}} disposable (after <b>tax)</b> <b>income.</b> <b>To</b> get the measure, one divides the percentage change in demand for the product by the percentage change in income. For example, if the demand for butter fell by 2 percent when incomes rose by 5 percent, the {{income elasticity}} of demand for butter is – 0. 4 percent. If demand for butter went up by 5 percent, the income elasticity of demand would be 0. 4. If instead it went up by 2 percent, the income elasticity of demand is 1. Most products have positive income elasticities of demand, meaning that as people become better off they buy more of it. Products that are consumed less as people become better off have negative income elasticities...|$|E
40|$|We revisit to {{what extent}} the {{increase}} in income inequality over the last 30 years has been mirrored by consumption inequality. We do so by constructing two alternative measures of consumption expenditure, using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). We first use reports of active savings and after <b>tax</b> <b>income</b> <b>to</b> construct the measure of consumption implied by the budget constraint. We find that the consumption inequality implied by savings behavior largely tracks income inequality between 1980 and 2007. Second, we use a demand system to correct for systematic measurement error in the CE’s expenditure data. Specifically, we consider trends in the relative expenditure of high income and low income households for different goods with different income (total expenditure) elasticities. Our estimation exploits the difference in the growth rate of luxury consumption inequality versus necessity consumption inequality. This “double-differencing, ” which we implement in a a regression framework, corrects for mis-measurement that can systematically vary over time by good and income group. This second exercise indicates that consumption inequality has closely tracked income inequality over the period 1980 - 2007. Both of our measures show a significantly greater increase in consumption inequality than what is obtained from the CE’s total household expenditure data directly...|$|E
