25|$|It is {{the most}} {{thermally}} stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing <b>through</b> <b>loss</b> of silicon starting from around 2700°C. It is resistant to most aqueous acids, phosphoric acid being an exception. It forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide {{on the surface and}} hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100°C and SiCl4 and CCl4 at 1000°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped. In its diamond-like behaviour it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to similar}} {{favourable}} climatic conditions, Eucalyptus plantations have often replaced oak woodlands, {{for example in}} California, Spain and Portugal. The resulting monocultures have raised concerns about loss of biological diversity, <b>through</b> <b>loss</b> of acorns that mammals and birds feed on, absence of hollows that in oak trees provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and small mammals and for bee colonies, as well as lack of downed trees in managed plantations. A study {{of the relationship between}} birds and eucalyptus in the San Francisco Bay Area found that bird diversity was similar in native forest vs. eucalyptus forest but the species were different. One way in which the avifauna changes is that cavity nesting birds including woodpeckers, owls, chickadees, wood ducks, etc. are depauperate in eucalyptus groves because the decay-resistant wood of these trees prevents cavity formation by decay or excavation. Also those bird species that glean insects from foliage, such as warblers and vireos, have population declines when eucalyptus replace oak forest. Birds that do well in eucalyptus groves in California like tall vertical habitat like herons and egrets (possibly because redwood trees are less available), or have longer bills, which {{may play a role in}} preventing their nostrils from being clogged by eucalyptus resin/pitch. The Point Reyes Bird Observatory observes that sometimes short-billed birds like the ruby-crowned kinglet are found dead beneath eucalyptus trees with their nostrils clogged with pitch.|$|E
