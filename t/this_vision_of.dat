In Indian art, <b>this</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> ideal couple is derived from Shiva and Parvati as being half of the other, {{represented}} as Ardhanarisvara. This concept is represented as an androgynous image that is half man and half woman, Siva and Parvati respectively.|$|E
25|$|During the Romantic Period, the Gothic novel, {{which was}} {{primarily}} a genre developed in Protestant countries, frequently associated Catholicism with terror and repression. <b>This</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish Inquisition appears in, among other works, The Monk (1796) by Matthew Gregory Lewis (set in Madrid during the Inquisition, but {{can be seen as}} commenting on the French Revolution and the Terror); Melmoth the Wanderer (1820) by Charles Robert Maturin and The Manuscript Found in Saragossa by Polish author Jan Potocki.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Saxons exercising {{extensive}} {{political and}} military power at an early date remains contested. The most developed vision of a continuation in sub-Roman Britain, with control over its own {{political and military}} destiny {{for well over a}} century, is that of Kenneth Dark, who suggests that the sub-Roman elite survived in culture, politics and military power up to c. 570. However, Nick Higham seems to agree with Bede, who identified three phases of settlement: an exploration phase, when mercenaries came to protect the resident population; a migration phase, which was substantial as implied by the statement that Anglus was deserted; and an establishment phase, in which Anglo-Saxons started to control areas, implied in Bede's statement about the origins of the tribes.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> a collegiate {{university}} has increasingly fallen away. The funding for colleges {{did not keep}} pace with the growth in student numbers, with the result that only four colleges were built. In later years when there was heavy student demand for scarce accommodation in Canterbury the solution was found in building additional on-campus accommodation but not in the form of further colleges. The hopes that students living off campus would stay around to eat dinner in their colleges were not met, whilst the abolition of college amenities fees removed students' direct stake in their colleges. With the growth of specialist subject departments as well as of other university wide facilities, {{more and more of the}} role of colleges was transferred to the central university. Accommodation and catering were transferred to the centralised University of Kent at Canterbury Hospitality (UKCH).|$|E
500|$|Director Neil Marshall {{lived near}} {{the ruins of}} Hadrian's Wall, a Roman {{fortification}} built to defend England against Scotland's tribes. The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: [...] "I had <b>this</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets—clearly from the future—facing a medieval knight on horseback." [...] The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.|$|E
500|$|Chernyi {{was born}} Pavel Dimitrievich Turchaninov (...) to an army colonel father. A [...] "déclassé intellectual" [...] whom anarchist {{historian}} Paul Avrich compares with Volin, Chernyi advocated a Nietzschean {{overthrow of the}} values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin {{as a threat to the}} freedom of the individual. Chernyi advocated the [...] "free association of independent individuals" [...] in a book titled Associational Anarchism and published in 1907. Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted <b>this</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner, and Benjamin Tucker. Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities.|$|E

500|$|Season 3 {{presents}} episodes that {{alternate between}} the two universes. [...] "Walternate", Walter's doppelgänger in the parallel universe, is the U.S. Secretary of Defense and has set events in motion to assemble the Machine, a doomsday device that reacts only to Peter's biology. He also sent his Olivia, [...] "Fauxlivia", to the prime universe, in Olivia's place, to engage the Fringe Division and assemble the prime universe's version of the device, while he studies Olivia's Cortexiphan-induced powers. By happenstance, Fauxlivia becomes pregnant with Peter's child, Henry, before being outed and extracted to the parallel universe. Walternate orchestrated acceleration of the pregnancy to gain {{a sample of the}} baby's blood, which he uses to activate the machine. Peter, with Olivia's help, enters the prime version of the machine, and experiences a vision of the future where the parallel universe has been destroyed and the same fate threatens the prime one, and learns the Machine is really a device created by Walter and his associates from this future, sent back in time purposely to relay <b>this</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the future to Peter. Recovering in the present, Peter alters his plan and uses the Machine to merge the two rooms, creating a bridge where inhabitants of both universes can solve their dilemma, before time is re-written so September (The Observer) doesn't save him and is forgotten by both Walter and Olivia.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his academic career, Abu Zaid developed a renewed hermeneutic view (the theory and methodology of text interpretation) of the Qur'an and further Islamic holy texts, arguing that they should be interpreted in the historical and cultural context of their time. The mistake of many Muslim scholars was [...] "to see the Qur'an only as a text, which led conservatives as well as liberals to a battle of quotations, each group seeing clear verses (when on their side) and ambiguous ones (when in contradiction with their vision)". But this type of controversy led both conservatives and liberals to produce authoritative hermeneutics. <b>This</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the Qur'an as a text was the vision of the elites of Muslim societies, whereas, at the same time, the Qur'an as [...] "an oral discourse" [...] played the most important part in the understanding of the masses.|$|E

Similarly, Gordis calls on Christians to understand with tolerance and respect that Jews do not accept these beliefs, since they are in contradiction to the Jewish understanding of the unity of God.
