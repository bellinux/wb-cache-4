In the 1970s the local inhabitants began to leave the settlement. This was a steady process and giving out new building sites did not improve the situation.|$|R

50|$|Persuasive writing {{could be}} used for {{commercial}} and non-commercial purposes. In both the purposes, the message of the writer should gain the attention of the reader. It should also build the interest about the product or service and reduce the resistance of the reader and it should always end up in motivating the action of the reader. The message of the writer could be about buying a product or service. That would be an example of a commercial purpose. A piece of writing can also convince the reader about non-commercial actions. An example of this would be a writing about minding your health and quit smoking. Marketing companies use persuasive writing a lot to convince their target group. Before they start writing their article <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of research about the target group. They {{try to find a way}} to reach their target group and a way to convince their target group. The research can make their persuasive writing very effective.|$|E
