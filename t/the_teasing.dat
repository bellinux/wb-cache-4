Finnessey recounted that she [...] "had a mullet, tinted glasses, acne and braces." [...] <b>The</b> <b>teasing</b> made it difficult for her to focus on her studies, so for her junior year she transferred to the private all-girls Incarnate Word Academy, where she graduated in 1996.

Following graduation, she worked briefly as a full-time substitute teacher in Jackson, Missouri, before starting graduate school.

Simon Price of The Independent commented the song borrows its electronic sound from Goldfrapp. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times complimented Spears' delivery and the lyrics, saying the song is [...] "about the kind of girl power that's focused on besting one obnoxious man, is also [...] and contemporary at the same time– more feminism as individualism". Mike Newmark of PopMatters called the song [...] " [...] a meaty, high-voltage shuffler helmed by the Outsyders, who do an admirable job of recreating the chemistry of Spears and Danja on last year’s single 'Gimme More'".|$|E

'While I be bangin' on your body, they be bangin' on our wall,' he sings. 'While they be dreamin', you be screamin', now they bangin' on our door.'" [...] Ready album reviews from Allmusic and PopMatters, noted the track as a standout, with Tyler Lewis of the latter stating the [...] "good" [...] songs like [...] "Neighbors" [...] and [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] "thump as they should".

Saying that [...] "Not since Ross and Rachel's tango on Friends has watching a comedy romance been so satisfying", The Hollywood Reporter said the producers [...] "did the impossible by engaging their leads in a love story, which only strengthened the artistry of the single-cam comedy". The New York Times said season 2 [...] "erupted in fantastic and bizarre fits and starts" [...] because of the characters' unmatched personalities, and lauded the writers for not playing up the will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. By emphasing how the characters got together, the show [...] "made for hilarious setups [...] to high-level Abbott and Costello slapstick. They have a modern love. [...] Together, they are fully functional. They make each other human." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan was unconcerned about getting Jess and Nick together, as because of immaturity [...] "they're bound to keep on {{making a lot of}} amusing and painful mistakes, sometimes with each other. Those choices can be both hilarious and sad, and New Girl has gotten a lot of mileage out of both those areas." [...] The continued Nick–Jess relationship was criticized in season 3 for dropping the characters' personalities, lack of tension, and for neglecting the show's female friendship between Jess and Cece. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt that {{during the first half of}} season 3 that [...] "bringing them together caused that [...] spark [...] to diminish", while Hitfix Alan Sepinwall and The A.V. Club David Sims found that the show's perceived decline in quality had less to do with the Nick–Jess relationship but with the handling of Schmidt's cheating arc and the re-introduction of Coach.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of humour in interaction is often {{closely tied to}} the intentions of the producer in question. The notion of intent that is invoked in humour research generally involves a deontological construct, where issues of moral accountability come to the fore. In this paper, the role of claims to non-serious intent with respect to (ostensibly) jocular forms of teasing amongst speakers of English are examined in order to broaden our understanding of this deontological account of intent. Building on an {{analysis of}} the action-sequential environments in which claims to non-serious intent are made, a distinction is first made between two distinct teasing practices, jocular mockery and jocular pretence. These practices are revealed as distinct through the design of <b>the</b> <b>tease</b> itself (i. e. whether it is delivered as non-serious or serious), the sequential placement of laughter from recipients (i. e. whether it is contiguous with <b>the</b> <b>tease</b> or delayed), and what next action is made contingently relevant by a claim to non-serious intent (i. e. a return to serious talk or laughter). It is subsequently claimed that claims to non-serious intent are not only sequentially implicative, but morally implicative as well, given such claims revolve around the degree to which producers may be legitimately held accountable for the potentially serious implications of <b>the</b> <b>tease</b> in question, {{and the degree to which}} recipients are licensed to take offence. The moral work associated with claims to non-serious intent include pre-empting or blocking the taking of offence in response to <b>the</b> <b>tease,</b> acknowledging a possible impropriety, sanctioning a recipient for taking things too seriously, and disputing the appositeness of the claim to non-serious intent itself. It is concluded that claiming non-serious intent is sequentially and morally implicative, and so constitutes a situated social action in and of itself, and that an analysis of the interpersonal implications of <b>teasing,</b> including <b>the</b> interactional accomplishment of interpersonal evaluations, participant identities and relationships, requires careful attention be directed accordingly. The implications of this first order, discursive account of intent for technical, second accounts of cognition-for-interaction are also briefly considered...|$|R
