5|$|At this point, Khánh had {{not spoken}} up and allowed <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the moves had been made without his {{consultation}} or against his will, and an attempt {{on the part of}} other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15thcentury Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are {{the work of the}} restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, {{and that they were}} aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War.

5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link.

5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted bow wave to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of high speed at all times.

5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again {{reinstating}} the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands.

5|$|Lafayette evaded Cornwallis' {{attempts}} to capture him in Richmond.

5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye.

5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials.

5|$|Sometime {{during their}} journey or their {{stay in the}} region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great {{mountain}} referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'.
