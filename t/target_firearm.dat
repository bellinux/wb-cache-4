50|$|Steel {{targets are}} <b>targets</b> for <b>firearms</b> {{made out of}} {{hardened}} (martensitic) steel, and are used in sports such as cowboy action shooting, practical/dynamic shooting and for long range shooting, as well as recreational plinking. They are popular in both training and competitions because the shooter gets instant feedback on a hit {{in the form of}} sound, and one can also often see the bullet getting pulverized and the target moving. Hanging or self-reseting targets also have the advantage that the shooter doesn't have to go forward to tape the targets, making it a good option for shooting ranges that otherwise have electronic targets. Steel targets also are weather proof, contrary to paper targets that may not hold up when wet.|$|R
50|$|When {{used against}} {{underwater}} <b>targets,</b> an underwater <b>firearm</b> {{may have a}} longer range and more penetrating power than spearguns. This is useful in such situations as shooting an underwater intruder where the projectile may have to first penetrate a reinforced dry suit, or a protective helmet (whether air-holding or not), or a thick tough part of his breathing set and its harness, or the plastic casing or transparent cover of a small underwater vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The cyclic rate {{reflects}} {{how fast}} a self-loading firearm can fire, extract, reload, and recock its mechanism {{to prepare for}} follow-up shots. This is not, however, the effective rate of fire. The effective rate of fire is {{the rate at which}} shots can be accurately (effectively) fired at a specific point <b>target.</b> Many <b>firearms</b> have been developed with high rates of fire which have proven to have extremely low rates of effective fire. An easy example of this is the MAC-10 [...] submachine gun. The MAC-10 in 9mm originally fired at 1,200 rpm. At this rate individual shots can no longer be heard so its fire sounds like a giant zipper being ripped apart. When a MAC-10 fires, the probability of hitting a target with more than 1 or 2 rounds is quite low. So it has a very poor effective rate of fire.|$|R

50|$|Tannerite is {{the brand}} name of a {{patented}} exploding <b>target</b> used for <b>firearms</b> practice, sold in kit form and containing the components of a binary explosive. The explosive comprises a combination of ammonium nitrate and/or ammonium perchlorate (oxidizers), and a fuel - primarily aluminum powder - that is supplied as two separate powders that are mixed by the user. The combination is relatively stable when subjected to forces less severe than a high-velocity bullet impact, such as a hammer blow, being dropped, or impact from a low-velocity bullet or shotgun blast. It is also not flammable - an explosion cannot be created by a burning fuse or electricity. Because it is sold as two separate powders, it can be transported and sold in many places without the legal restrictions that would otherwise apply to explosives. The target {{system as a whole}} is the patented, trademarked product called Tannerite, although the term is often used to refer to the explosive mixture itself, and other combination explosives are often generically referred to as Tannerite.|$|R
40|$|What {{will happen}} after District of Columbia v. Heller? We know that five justices on the Supreme Court now oppose {{comprehensive}} federal prohibitions on home handgun possession by some class of trustworthy homeowners {{for the purpose}} of, and maybe only at the time of, self-defense. Perhaps the justices will push further and apply Heller 2 ̆ 7 s holding {{to state and local}} governments via the Fourteenth Amendment. But the majority opinion in Heller offered limited guidance for future cases. It did not follow a purely originalist method of constitutional interpretation, nor did it establish a constraining doctrinal framework for evaluating firearms regulation-although the opinion did gratuitously suggest that much existing gun control is acceptable. There is significant room for judges to maneuver after Heller. In the absence of more information from the Supreme Court, we identify plausible legal arguments for the next few rounds of litigation and assess the stakes for social welfare. Based on available data, we conclude that some salient legal arguments after Heller have little or no likely consequence for social welfare. For example, the looming constitutional fight over local handgun bans-an issue on which we present original empirical data-seems largely inconsequential. The same can be said for a right to carry a firearm in public with a permit. On the other hand, less prominent legal arguments could be quite threatening to social welfare. At some point judges might draw on free speech doctrine and presumptively disfavor taxation or regulation <b>targeted</b> especially at <b>firearms.</b> This could have serious consequences. In addition, and perhaps most important, Second Amendment doctrine might deter innovative regulatory responses to the problem of gun violence. The threat of litigation may inhibit useful policy experimentation ranging from personalized firearms technology and the microstamping of shell casings, to pre-market review of gun design, social-cost taxation, gun-owner insurance requirements, and beyond...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and nature}} of civilian firearm- and explosion-injuries in Finland, {{and the nature of}} severe gunshot injuries of the extremities were described in seven original articles. The main data sources used were the National Hospital Discharge Register, the Cause-of-Death Register, and the Archive of Death Certificates at Statistics Finland. The present study was population based. Epidemiologic methods were used in six and clinical analyses in five papers. In these clinical studies, every original hospital record and death certificate was critically analyzed. The trend of hospitalized firearm injuries has slightly declined in Finland from the late 1980 s to the early 2000 s. The occurrence decreased from 5. 1 per 100 000 person-years in 1990 to 2. 6 in 2003. The decline was found in the unintentional firearm injuries. A high incidence of unintentional injuries by firearms was characteristic of the country, while violence and homicides by firearms represented a minor problem. The incidence of fatal non-suicidal firearm injuries has been stable, 1. 8 cases per 100 000 person-years. Suicides using firearms were eight times more common during the period studied. This is contrary to corresponding reports from many other countries. However, the use of alcohol and illegal drugs or substances was detected in as many as one-third of the injuries studied. The median length of hospitalization was three days and it was significantly associated (p< 0. 001) with the type of injury. The mean length of hospital stay has decreased from the 1980 s to the early 2000 s. In this study, there was a special interest in gunshot injuries of the extremities. From a clinical point of view, the nature of severe extremital gunshot wounds, as well as the primary operative approach in their management, varied. The patients with severe injuries of this kind were managed at university and central hospital emergency departments, by general surgeons in smaller hospitals and by cardiothoracic or vascular surgeons in larger hospitals. Injuries were rarities and as such challenges for surgeons on call. Some noteworthy aspects of the management were noticed and these should be focused on in the future. On the other hand, the small population density and the relatively large geographic area of Finland do not favor high volume, centralized trauma management systems. However, experimental war surgery has been increasingly taught in the country from the 1990 s, and excellent results could be expected during the present decade. Epidemiologically, explosion injuries can be considered a minor problem in Finland at present, but their significance should not be underestimated. Fatal explosion injuries showed up sporadically. An increase occurred from 2002 to 2004 for no obvius reason. However, in view of the historical facts, a possibility for another rare major explosion involving several people might become likely within the next decade. The national control system of firearms is mainly based on the new legislations from 1998 and 2002. However, as shown in this study, {{there is no reason to}} assume that the national hospitalization policies, or the political climate, or the legislation might have changed over the study period and influenced the declining development, at least not directly. Indeed, the reason for the decline to appear in the incidence of unintentional injuries only remains unclear. It may derive from many practical steps, e. g. locked firearm cases, or from the stability of the community itself. For effective reduction of firearm-related injuries, preventive measures, such as education and counseling, should be <b>targeted</b> at recreational <b>firearm</b> users. To sum up, this study showed that the often reported increasing trend in firearm as well as explosion-related injuries has not manifested in Finland. Consequently, it can be recognized that, overall, the Finnish legislation together with the various strategies have succeeded in preventing firearm- and explosion-related injuries in the country. Tässä väitöskirjatutkimuksessa, joka koostui seitsemästä osajulkaisusta, selvitettiin ampuma- ja räjähdysvammojen epidemiologiaa Suomessa kahdenkymmenen vuoden ajalta, vuodesta 1985 vuoteen 2004. Lisäksi arvioitiin kliinisemmin raajojen vakavia ampumavammoja. Sairaalahoitoa vaativat ampumavammat ovat Suomessa vähentyneet tarkastelujakson aikana. 1980 -luvun lopussa sairaalassa hoidettujen ampumavammapotilaiden insidenssi oli 5. 1 tapausta 100 000 henkilövuotta kohden (254 kpl), mutta vuonna 2003 enää vain 2, 6 tapausta 100 000 henkilövuotta kohden (133 kpl). Tämä väheneminen perustui ensisijassa tapaturmaisten vammojen vähenemiseen, kun sen sijaan väkivaltaisissa ampumavammautumisissa ei selvää pysyvämpää muutosta havaittu. Kuolemaan johtaneissa ampumavammoissa havaittiin pieni väheneminen viimevuosina. Ylivoimaisesti merkitävin riskitekijä ampumiselle on itsemurhayritys. Sairaalahoitoa vaatineita räjähdysvammautumisia esiintyi 1990 -luvulla vain 2 tapausta 100 000 henkilövuotta kohden (100 kpl). Hyvin harvinaisissa kuolemaan johtaneissa räjähdysvammoissa havaittiin pieni lisääntyminen 2000 -luvun alussa. Tutkimuksen merkittävin löydös oli, että toisin kuin monissa muissa maissa, ampumavammojen määrä on Suomessa laskussa. Tärkeä löydös on vammautumiseen liittyvä merkittävä (kolmanneksessa tapauksista) samanaikainen alkoholin ja huumeiden käyttö. Tämä on haaste tulevaisuudelle mikäli alkoholin käyttö Suomessa kasvaa. Kolmas löydös oli, että raajojen vaikeiden ampumavammojen hoidossa esiintyi yllättäen yksittäisiä komplikaatioita. Näiden taustalla on ensisijassa vammojen harvinaisuus ja laajat etäisyydet jotka eivät suosi suuria tapaturmien hoitokeskuksia. Harvinaisissa räjähdyskuolemissa on esiintynyt hienoinen nousu viimevuosina ilman selvää osoitettavaa taustasyytä. Yhteenvetona tutkimus osoitti, että ampuma- ja räjähdysvammautuminen on Suomessa kokonaisuutena vakaa ja pääosin hallinnassa. Ampumalainsäädännön uudistuksien ja erilaisten preventiivisten ohjelmien voidaan katsoa onnistuneen tehtävässään...|$|R
