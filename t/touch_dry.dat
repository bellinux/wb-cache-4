The alkyd resin was synthesized {{with the aim of}} obtaining a varnish without standing film properties, especially drying characteristics enhance by significant amount of a-eleostetic acid (ctt, 9, 11, 13 - 18 : 3), where is having conjugated double bonds, presence in karawila seed oil. A series of alkyd resins were prepared maintaining 65 % oil length by changing the ratio of karawila seed oil from 0 - 50 % (by w/w%). The other constituents of alkyd resins werepentaerythritol, phthalic anhydride, xylene and sodium methoxide as catalyst. Due to the lowacid values of the seed oils monoglyceride process was selected and obtained accept able standard for transesterification and polye sterification reactions and 240 °C temperature was maintained at transesteritication and esterification stages. Patton constant and the ratio of OH:COOH groups were maintained closer to 1. 00 when preparing alkyd resins. In addition, the alkydresins were prepared by maintaining final acici. value below 20 mg/g to make sure the extent of polymerization was in the range of 90 % to 95 %. Physicochemical properties of these alkydresin solutions were examined to see the effect with the increase of karawila seed oil in the resin. The solid content was adjusted to 50 % and cobalt octate with lead octate were used as driers to prepare varnish from these alkyd resins. The film properties of the alkyd resins were examined to find the optimum ratio of karawila oil to soya bean oil. Mechanical properties, chemical resistant properties and drying properties of these films were examined and evaluated in this regardThe alkyd resin blended with 30 % karawila seed oil showed the best film properties in the oil blended series and it also render lower set to <b>touch</b> <b>drying</b> time and <b>dry</b> to <b>touch</b> <b>drying</b> time, better scratch hardness, adhesion and better gloss.

The industrial problems of skim coats are of two major types; mixing related and application related. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank these problems according to their relative importance. Difficult to trim, poor workability and poor mixing were having the highest ranking based on the comments given by the manufacturers, retailers and users. The effect of thickener percentage in the skim coat {{was found to be}} significant for difficulties in mixing. Mixing was easy up to 0. 5 % of thickener and the flowability was found to be the best in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of thickener. Increase of thickener percentage has increased the tendency for forming agglomerates and lumps of paste during mixing. Good workability and optimum setting could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 5 % of thickener. Optimum performance for trimming could be achieved with 0. 3 – 0. 6 % of thickener. The above qualitative results were verified quantitatively with the physical testing; ram extrusion, set to <b>touch</b> <b>drying</b> time test, pencil hardness test and dust weight on trimming.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Fingerprints have provided a crucial source of forensic evidence {{for well over a}} century. Their power lies in an inherent ability for human identification and individualisation, which is based on two fundamental properties: uniqueness and lifelong permanence. Latent fingermarks represent by far the most evidentially common and challenging form of deposition, whereby an invisible copy of the unique friction ridge fingertip pattern is left as an amalgamated secretory residue on any surface that is <b>touched.</b> <b>Dry</b> powder dusting, the first and most iconic method for visualising or developing these deposits, was developed {{in the latter part of}} the 19 th Century. In the period since, a great number of additional techniques, utilising physical, chemical and optical interactions in isolation or combined, have been devised for the same purpose. By selecting the correct technique in the correct order, it is now possible to extract significant print details from an unprecedented variety of surfaces. In the UK, such operational choices are recommended via Home Office issued protocol tables, which offer an optimum guide based on substrate type, substrate properties and fingermark conditions. Development technique specificity has improved in the last half-century alongside increased biochemical understanding of residue composition, however, the shear variety of potential deposition substrates that exist within a heavily industrialised world inevitably causes disparities in efficiency, even within single protocol classifications. These effects are compounded by the enormous potential for pre- and post-deposition residue composition variation, relating to donor factors (age, sex, diet, lifestyle, etc.) and time dependant changes (environmental, biological, etc.) respectively. As a result, routine technique application can cause sub-optimal development. This research utilises high resolution imaging and analysis techniques to demonstrate how subtle surface chemistry and topography features can selectively influence routine technique efficiency within a single protocol classification (smooth, nonporous plastics). Titanium dioxide, a widely used white pigment, has been shown as prevalent in a range of polymers following SEM and EDX analysis, either in a patchy or ubiquitous distribution. SEM analysis demonstrates a strong interaction between the pigment and carbon powder suspension, which causes detrimental overdevelopment effects in off-ridge areas. ToF-SIMS mapping of a Formica substrate places a significant amount of patchy distributed titanium dioxide in the top 30 nm of the surface. Mapping also indicated the presence of an aluminosilicate pigment coating; however, it’s involvement in the possible surface potential or surface energy interaction mechanism is unknown The effects of linear surface features, which have previously been implicated in off-ridge cyanoacrylate overdevelopment on two operationally relevant polymers, were also analysed by creating a silicon wafer model for micro-FTIR analysis. Fingermark residues, including hydroxyl groups, have been shown to migrate significant distances along induced scratches in the model substrate over a 48 hr period. It is likely that observed overdevelopment along large valley-like features (uPVC) and scratches (polyethylene) in the operationally relevant polymers is caused by a similar migration of residues.

The tower, as they left it behind, looked all the quainter, because such entrances are usually flanked by two towers; and this one looked lopsided.

High-resolution rainfall in each grid cell was downscaled by taking the climatological variables from the four grid cells in the coarse domain. The M 5 n model was configured as an MLP-BG network with three hidden layers using the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid activation function. The optimal predictors for M 5 n were rainfall in D 1 (RD 1), atmospheric temperature at 1400  mm (tk), geographical height (hgt), sea level pressure (slp), ground heat flux (grdflx), surface pressure (psfc), planetary boundary layer height (pblh), and humidity at 2  m (q 2). In addition to having high accuracy, applying WRF-ANN {{is also expected to}} reduce computational costs. Running 30 -km WRF and using ANN to downscale to 6  km is 89 % less expensive than running nested 30 - and 6 -km WRF simulations. We developed a calibration method (RE-ANN) to help ANN better capture dry days. This method treats a grid cell in D 2 T as dry if it was <b>touching</b> a <b>dry</b> grid cell in D 1. This improved our simulation of dry days with ANN. The network trained for RE events and calibrated with the RE-ANN calibration method delivered the best prediction for our study area and period.

The application of ANN with WRF was effective for rapidly downscaling daily basic rainfall data in a season at low computational cost.|$|R
