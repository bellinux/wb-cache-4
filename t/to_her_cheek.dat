But after completing the [...] "V" [...] on her breast and ribs she requested sterile dressings to avoid blood poisoning, and her plan was aborted by the authorities.

The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, [...] "My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled." ...|$|E
