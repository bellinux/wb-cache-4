Existing games also continue to thrive on new business models, such as <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> downloadable content to provide songs to players.

5|$|Romney {{supported}} raising various fees, {{including those}} for drivers' licenses and gun licenses, {{to raise more}} than $300million. He increased a special gasoline retailer fee by two cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in additional revenue. Opponents said <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> fees sometimes imposed a hardship on those who could least afford them. Romney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $181million from businesses {{over the next two}} years and over $300million for his term. He did so in the face of conservative and corporate critics who viewed these actions as tax increases.|$|E
5|$|The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit {{underwent}} substantial reconfiguration in the build-up to the event.

The most significant changes {{were made in the}} final part, with the Peraltada corner cut in half and the circuit redirected through the Foro Sol stadium complex in the circuit infield beginning with turn 12, following a similar layout to the one used by Champ Car between 2002 and 2007. The track layout featured two drag reduction system (DRS) zones, one on the main straight and another between turns three and four.|$|E

5|$|The {{archaeology}} of Iowa is {{the study}} of the buried remains of human culture within the state of Iowa from the earliest prehistoric through the late historic periods. When the American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500–2,800 years ago) American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on <b>the</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> {{expressions}} {{gives the}} language great flexibility. Because Lisp functions are written as lists, {{they can be}} processed exactly like data.
