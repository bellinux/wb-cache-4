5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a <b>trough</b> extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the <b>trough</b> and cold front moved eastward. The <b>trough</b> gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the <b>trough</b> as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the <b>trough.</b> The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents {{through the morning}} of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level <b>trough</b> of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east {{in response to the}} <b>trough.</b> Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the <b>trough</b> to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak <b>trough</b> moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the <b>trough</b> into two distinct segments.|$|E
5|$|An active <b>trough</b> of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the <b>trough</b> was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the <b>trough</b> extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the <b>trough,</b> about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar <b>trough</b> gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
25|$|The spiral <b>troughs</b> {{in the ice}} cap {{are formed}} by {{katabatic}} winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the <b>troughs,</b> likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes. The <b>troughs</b> are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction, which is shifted by the Coriolis effect, leading to the spiral pattern. The <b>troughs</b> gradually migrate towards the pole over time; the central <b>troughs</b> have moved about 65km in the last 2 million years. Chasma Boreale is a canyon-like feature older than the <b>troughs,</b> and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction.|$|R

A total of around 700 <b>troughs</b> were distributed by the trust in Australia and 50 in several other countries.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>troughs</b> of low {{pressure}} in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are characterized by decreasing atmospheric pressure from south to north while inverted <b>troughs</b> are characterized by decreasing pressure from north to south. The situation is opposite in the Southern Hemisphere. Inverted <b>troughs</b> in both hemispheres move to the west from the east, while mid-latitude <b>troughs</b> generally move with the westerlies toward the east.|$|R
5|$|The {{interaction}} of two tropical waves and an upper-level <b>trough</b> {{led to the}} development of a tropical depression over the central Atlantic by 12:00UTC on August2. The depression steadily organized after formation, intensifying into Tropical Storm Colin by 06:00UTC on August3. An abnormally strong ridge to the storm's north steered Colin to the west-northwest; reaching a forward speed up to 30mph (50km/h), the system was unable to maintain a closed circulation and instead degenerated into a <b>trough</b> by 18:00UTC that day. Over the coming days, the <b>trough</b> decelerated and recurved north into a weakness in the ridge while still producing tropical storm-force winds. Satellite imagery showed the reformation of a well-defined circulation by 12:00UTC on August5, and the system was once again classified as Tropical Storm Colin. After attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), an approaching <b>trough</b> sheared the cyclone and turned it northeast. Colin weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on August8 and degenerated into a <b>trough</b> for a second time twelve hours later; the <b>trough</b> dissipated early on August9.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trough</b> systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, <b>trough</b> collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the <b>trough.</b> Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the early}} hours of September6, Nate became quasi-stationary under a weak {{steering}} pattern between Hurricane Maria and a disturbance over The Bahamas. Satellite imagery indicated that the cloud pattern continued to organize with excellent outflow surrounding the storm. Late on September6 a developing banding eye feature became evident. Tropical Storm Nate strengthened further and became a hurricane at 1200 UTCon September7, as it began to turn away from Bermuda. Some models indicated that Nate could have been either absorbed by or merged with the larger Hurricane Maria, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast that Nate would survive as a separate system, which it did. The large low to the northeast of The Bahamas gradually opened into a broad <b>trough</b> as a shortwave <b>trough</b> approached from the northwest. The larger <b>trough</b> slowly became elongated in a northeast–southwest manner late on September7. At the same time, the shortwave <b>trough</b> moved southward along {{the west side of the}} other <b>trough.</b> The increasing southwesterly flow along the southeast side of the broad <b>trough</b> caused Nate to accelerate northeastward. Nate reached its peak intensity of 90mph (145km/h) late on September8 as it passed 120miles (205km) southeast of Bermuda, while its strongest winds remained well offshore.|$|E
50|$|The Wave {{consists}} of intersecting U-shaped <b>troughs</b> {{that have been}} eroded into Navajo Sandstone of Jurassic age. The two major <b>troughs</b> which comprise this rock formation are 62 ft wide by 118 ft long and 7 ft wide by 52 ft long. Initially, infrequent runoff eroded these <b>troughs</b> along joints within the Navajo Sandstone. After their formation, the drainage basin, which fed rainwater to these <b>troughs,</b> shrank {{to the point that}} the runoff became insufficient to contribute to the cutting of these <b>troughs.</b> As a result, the <b>troughs</b> are now almost exclusively eroded by wind, as indicated by the orientation of erosional steps and risers cut into the sandstone along their steep walls. These erosional steps and risers are oriented relative to the predominant direction of the wind as it is now naturally funneled into and through these <b>troughs.</b>|$|R

5|$|A non-tropical low {{pressure}} area developed about 240miles (390km) south-southwest of Bermuda on April 18 through the interaction of an upper-level <b>trough</b> and a surface frontal <b>trough.</b> The surface <b>trough,</b> which extended from the gale center to Hispaniola, brought a plume of moisture northward from the Caribbean Sea into the circulation, which caused heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico. The non-tropical low tracked generally northward, with a ridge to its east and west, and on April 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center; early that day, satellite imagery indicated {{the presence of a}} tight inner core of winds. After turning to the northwest, it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system, due to the deepening of the upper-level <b>trough</b> over the system. Convection became better organized over the center, and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on April 20 while located about 250miles (400km) west of Bermuda. Operationally, the subtropical cyclone was not classified by the National Hurricane Center until 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} <b>trough</b> {{consists of}} a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic <b>trough</b> systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level <b>trough</b> {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a <b>trough</b> about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|A <b>trough</b> {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August. The <b>trough</b> remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico and a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175miles (280km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|By late on May 29, a weak <b>trough</b> {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over the Yucatán Channel. Convection increased {{in association with the}} <b>trough,</b> and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from the <b>trough</b> extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; {{this was}} the result of the interaction between an upper-level <b>trough</b> and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level <b>trough</b> gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level <b>trough</b> to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} the Valles Marineris remains controversial. Erosional, tectonic, and hybrid {{processes}} have been proposed. To clarify these contradictions, the widths and depths of pit chains and <b>troughs</b> were compared and {{it was found that}} the features do not form a continuum. Rather, results are consistent with the hypothesis that pit chains formed by surficial collapse and <b>troughs</b> by deeper seated and coherent failure. All pit chains and linear depressions in the Valles Marineris region were classified by inspection into six morphologic categories: pit chains (linear arrays of small pits); floored chains (arrays of pit chains having flat or hummocky floors); scalloped <b>troughs</b> (wider linear depressions with scalloped wall segments); narrow <b>troughs</b> (depressions of intermediate width with straight wall segments); wide <b>troughs</b> (broad, linear depressions); and chaotic <b>troughs</b> (more irregular depressions displaying some channel morphologies).

5|$|During June1966, low {{atmospheric}} pressure {{stretched across the}} western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexicoa pattern that is conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. During {{the first few days}} of the month, a dissipating <b>trough</b> extended from the southeastern United States into the western Caribbean. A mid-level circulation developed along the <b>trough</b> near Cabo Gracias a Dios on June3. By the next day, the circulation had reached the surface, which marked the development of a tropical depression over eastern Nicaragua. On June 5, the depression crossed Honduras and emerged into the western Caribbean, moving north-northeastward through an area of warm sea surface temperatures. It had a good cyclonic circulation, convection, and moisture content, but most significantly, a passing <b>trough</b> to the north provided the depression with favorable outflow. On June 6, the depression rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm and later Hurricane Alma. This made it the earliest hurricane in the basin since Hurricane Able in 1951.|$|E

40|$|A {{subglacial}} {{drainage network}} underneath the paleo-ice sheet off West Greenland is revealed {{by a new}} compilation of high-resolution bathymetry data from Melville Bay, northeast Baffin Bay. This drainage network is an indicator for ice streaming and subglacial meltwater flow toward the outer shelf. Repeated ice sheet advances and retreats across the crystalline basement together with subglacial meltwater drainage had their impact in eroding overdeepened <b>troughs</b> along ice stream pathways.

Most of the <b>troughs</b> follow tectonic weakness zones such as faults and fractures in the crystalline bedrock. Many of these tectonic features correspond with the orientations of major fault axes in the Baffin Bay region. The <b>troughs</b> extend from the present (sub) glacial fjord systems at the Greenland coast and parallel modern outlet-glacier pathways. The fast flowing paleo-ice streams were likely accelerated from the meltwater flow as indicated by glacial landforms within and along the <b>troughs.</b> The ice streams flowed along narrow tributary <b>troughs</b> and merged to form large paleo-ice streams bedded in the major cross-shelf <b>troughs</b> of Melville Bay.

Within 12 hours of reaching peak intensity, however, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status. The approaching <b>trough,</b> which had previously caused Charley to turn northward, forced the hurricane to accelerate northeastward and later eastward, bringing the storm about 80 mi (130 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts on August 19. As the <b>trough</b> {{was not very}} strong, Charley slowly underwent the process of extratropical transition, unlike other tropical cyclones that complete the transition much quicker with a stronger <b>trough.</b> As a result, the storm maintained hybrid, or subtropical characteristics for several days.

5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level <b>trough</b> emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled.

A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E
