40|$|Compressed sensing {{deals with}} the {{recovery}} of sparse signals from linear measurements. Without any additional information, {{it is possible to}} recover an s-sparse signal using m ≳ s (d/s) measurements in a robust and stable way. Some applications provide additional information, such as on the location of the support of the signal. Using this information, it is conceivable the <b>threshold</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> can be lowered. A proposed algorithm for this task is weighted ℓ_ 1 -minimization. Put shortly, one modifies standard ℓ_ 1 -minimization by assigning different weights to different parts of the index set [1, [...] . d]. The task of choosing the weights is however non-trivial. This paper provides a complete {{answer to the question of}} an optimal choice of the weights. In fact, it is shown that it is possible to directly calculate unique weights that are optimal in the sense that the <b>threshold</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> needed for exact recovery is minimized. The proof uses recent results about the connection between convex geometry and compressed sensing-type algorithms. Comment: Changes in version 2 : Peer reviewed version.

40|$|The {{effects of}} binary tidal forces on {{transport}} within an accretion disk are studied with a time-dependent hydrodynamical {{model of a}} two-dimensional isothermal accretion disk. Tidal forces quickly truncate the accretion disk to radii of order half the average radius of the Roche lobe, and excite a two-armed spiral wave that remains stationary in the rotating reference frame of the binary system. We measure an effective alpha of order 0. 1 near {{the outer edge of}} the disk in all of our models, independent of the mass ratio, Mach number, and radial density profile. However, in cold disks with high Mach number, the effective alpha drops rapidly with decreasing radius such that it falls below our <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> (roughly. 001) at a radius of only one third the tidal radius. In warmer disks where the Mach numbers remain below 20, we can measure an effective alpha down to radii 10 times smaller than the maximum size of the disk. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{significance}} of treating a set of measurements as a time series is being explored. Time Series Analysis (TSA) techniques, part of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach, can provide much insight regarding the stochastic correlations that are induced {{on the outcome of}} an experiment by the measurement system and can provide criteria for the limited use of the classical variance in metrology. Specifically, techniques such as the Lag Plots, Autocorrelation Function, Power Spectral Density and Allan Variance are used to analyze series of sequential measurements, collected at equal time intervals from an electromechanical transducer. These techniques are used in conjunction with power law models of stochastic noise in order to characterize time or frequency regimes for which the usually assumed white noise model is adequate for the description of the measurement system response. However, through the detection of colored noise, usually referred to as flicker noise, which is expected to appear in almost all electronic devices, a lower <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> uncertainty for this particular system is obtained and the white noise model is no longer accurate.

40|$|In this work, {{time series}} {{analysis}} techniques are used to analyze sequential, equispaced mass measurements of a Si density artifact, collected from an electromechanical transducer. Specifically, techniques such as Power Spectral Density, Bretthorst periodogram, Allan variance and Modified Allan variance can provide much insight regarding the stochastic correlations that are induced {{on the outcome of}} an experiment by the measurement system and establish criteria for the limited use of the classical variance in metrology. These techniques are used in conjunction with power law models of stochastic noise in order to characterize time or frequency regimes by pointing out the different types of frequency modulated (FM) or phase modulated (PM) noise. In the case of phase noise, only Modified Allan variance can tell between white PM and flicker PM noise. Oscillations in the system can be detected accurately with the Bretthorst periodogram. Through the detection of colored noise, which is expected to appear in almost all electronic devices, a lower <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> uncertainty is obtained and the white noise model of statistical independence can no longer provide accurate results for the examined data set.

40|$|A {{number of}} authors (Voutilainen 1999; Brants 2000) have {{explored}} the ceiling on consistency of human grammatical annotation of natural-language samples. It {{is not always}} appreciated that this issue covers two rather separate sub-issues: (i) how refined can a well-defined scheme of annotation be? (ii) how accurately can human analysts learn to apply a well-defined but highly-refined scheme? The first issue relates to the inherent nature of a language, or of whichever aspect of its structure an annotation scheme represents. The second relates to the human ability to be explicit about the properties of a language. To give an analogy: if we aimed to measure the size (volume) of individual clouds in the sky, one limitation we would face is that the fuzziness of a cloud makes its size ill-defined beyond some threshold of precision; another limit is that our technology may not enable us to surpass some other, perhaps far lower <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> precision. The analogy is not perfect. Clouds exist independently of human beings, whereas the properties of a language sample are aspects of the behaviour of people, including linguistic analysts. Nevertheless, the two issues are logically distinct, though the distinction between them {{has not always been}} drawn in past discussions.

These subjects also had Whole Organ MRI Score (WORMS) scoring of cartilage damage, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), meniscal pathology, and synovitis, as well as baseline radiographic evaluation for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grading. Knee compartments were classified as progressors when exceeding <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> variability in normal knees. All potential risk factors of cartilage loss were dichotomized into “present” (score ≥ 2 for cartilage, ≥ 1 for others) or “absent”. Differences in baseline scores of ipsi-compartmental risk factors were compared between progressor and non-progressor knees by multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, alignment axis (degrees) and baseline KL grade. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % CIs were calculated for medial femorotibial compartment (MFTC) and lateral femorotibial compartment (LFTC) cartilage loss. Cartilage loss across both compartments was studied using Generalized Estimating Equations. Results 196 knees of 196 participants were included (age 59. 8  ±  6. 3 years [mean ± SD], BMI 29. 5  ±  4. 6, 62 % women).

Recent studies have revealed that concentrations below 1 pptV can significantly promote nucleation of sulfuric acid particles. While sulfuric acid detection is relatively straightforward, no amine measurements to date have been able to reach the critical sub-pptV concentration range and atmospheric amine concentrations are in general poorly characterized. In this work we present a proof-of-concept of an instrument capable of detecting dimethyl amine (DMA) with concentrations even down to 70 ppqV (parts per quadrillion, 0. 07 pptV) for a 15 min integration time. Detection of ammonia and amines other than dimethyl amine is discussed. We also report results from the first ambient measurements performed in spring 2013 at a boreal forest site.

The <b>measurements</b> reveal a microscopic state that evolves rapidly from entirely collisional to largely frictional, as the system is taken close to jamming. On coarse-grained time scales, some descriptors of the dynamics—such as the probability distribution of force fluctuations, or the mean friction angle—do not reflect this profound change in the micromechanics of the flow. Other quantities, such as the frequency spectrum of force fluctuations, change significantly, developing low-frequency structure in the fluctuations as jamming is approached. We also show evidence of spatial structure, with force fluctuations being organized into local collision chains. These local structures propagate rapidly in the flow, with consequences far away from their origin, leading to long-range correlations in velocity fluctuations...|$|R
