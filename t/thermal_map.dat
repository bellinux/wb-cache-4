50|$|One of the {{challenges}} for HW or SW designers is to validate their simulation data with empirical data. They require some type of utility or tool to measure power consumption and compare with their simulation data. One of these methods to capture real time data to validate power or thermal models is an infrared measurement setup developed by F.J. Mesa-Martinez, J.Nayfach-Battilana and J. Renau at University of California Santa Cruz. Their approach is to capture thermal maps using infrared cameras with high spatial resolution and high frame rate. Then a genetic algorithm finds a power equation for each floorplan block of processor that produces the capture <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> to give detailed information about power breakdown (leakage and dynamic). They also developed an image processing filter to increase the thermal image accuracy. The biggest challenge for this approach is to obtain a detailed power map from the thermal measurements. There is no direct mapping between measured information and power. A genetic algorithm was developed described in reference that iterates multiple thermal traces and compares them with the results from thermal simulator {{to find the best}} power correlation.|$|E
50|$|SThM {{requires}} {{the use of}} specialized probes. There are two types of thermal probes: Thermocouple probes where the probe temperature is monitored by a thermocouple junction at the probe tip and resistive or bolometer probes where the probe temperature is monitored by a thin-film resistor at probe tip. These probes are generally made from thin dielectric films on a silicon substrate and use a metal or semiconductor film bolometer to sense the tip temperature. Other approaches, using more involved micro machining methods, have also been reported. In a bolometer probe the resistor is used as a local heater and the fractional change in probe resistance is used to detect the temperature and/or the thermal conductance of the sample. When the tip is placed in contact with the sample, heat flows from the tip to sample. As the probe is scanned, the amount of heat flow changes. By monitoring the heat flow, one can create a <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> of the sample, revealing spatial variations in thermal conductivity in a sample. Alternately the sample may be actively heated, for example a powered circuit, to visualize the distribution of temperatures on the sample.|$|E

The {{composition}} and structure of enamel and dentin are different, resulting in different thermal properties. This gives an opportunity to characterize enamel and dentin from their thermal properties and to visually present the findings as a <b>thermal</b> <b>map.</b> The thermal properties of demineralized enamel and dentin may also be sufficiently different from sound tissue to be seen on a <b>thermal</b> <b>map,</b> underpinning future thermal assessment of caries. The primary aim of this novel study was to produce a <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> of a sound, human tooth-slice to visually characterize enamel and dentin. The secondary aim was to map a human tooth-slice with demineralized enamel and dentin to consider future diagnostic potential of thermal maps for caries-detection. Two human slices of teeth, one sound and one demineralized from a natural carious lesion, were cooled on ice, then transferred to a hotplate at 30 °C where the rewarming-sequence was captured by an infra-red thermal camera. Calculation of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity was undertaken, and two methods of data-processing used customized software to produce thermal maps from the thermal characteristic-time-to-relaxation and heat-exchange. The two types of thermal maps characterized enamel and dentin. In addition, sound and demineralized enamel and dentin were distinguishable within both maps.

40|$|Abstract—As chips become faster, {{the need}} to test them at their {{intended}} speed of operation has been recognized. High-speed operation, together with the higher switching activity typically induced during test, {{can result in a}} die-thermal distribution significantly different from that achieved during normal operation. Differences in <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> distribution between normal- and test-mode operations give rise to a nonuniform impact on the relative path delay within logic blocks. The impact of test-induced hot spots may artificially slow down non-critical paths or speed-up critical ones with respect to the clock making the whole die to fail (pass) delay testing for a good (bad) part. The non-uniform thermal-induced delay is especially important for clock circuitry, the most critical block, which is impacted even if exact zero-skew clock routing algorithms are adopted. In this work we analyze the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> temperature changes on the clock delay identifying a new delay-fault mechanism. We propose a technique to minimize the impact of different test- and normal-mode thermal maps by making the clock tree speed independent of temperature gradients. This technique allows applying confidently delay test patterns to the die regardless of the thermalmap test-induced modification.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method of}} extracting a {{conservative}} thermal model from an existing PCB assembled converter is investigated. This improves upon thermal management by increasing the thermal management contribution of the PCB itself. A thermal calibration loop is proposed in which a given converter is analyzed and data extracted, {{in order to create}} a <b>thermal</b> <b>map</b> of the surface tem-perature from which the component layout and thermal profiles can be estimated. Thermal figures of merit are vital to quantify the thermal adjustments, recorded in this <b>thermal</b> <b>map,</b> which are required during thermal calibration. The thermal figures of merit are also flexible enough to allow for specific optimization objectives such as high power density, or overall reliability. Two graphical means to predict temperature profiles required in the thermal cal-ibration loop have been investigated: a thermal resistor network method with a purely analytical approach, suitable for relatively small systems where the geometry and loss analysis are simple (fewer than ten components), or a more elaborate method using a finite difference method algorithm, implemented in a spreadsheet environment. Both provide flexible means for PCB thermal layout and provide straightforward graphical visualization. A case study illustrates the complete design method.

40|$|During {{the winter}} period ice {{is likely to}} form on roads, making {{pavement}} surfaces slippery and increasing accident risk. Road surface temperature (RST) {{is one of the}} most important parameters in ice formation. The LIFE+ “CLEANROADS” project aims to forecast RSTs in advance in order to support road maintenance services in the timely and effective preparation of preventive anti-icing measures. This support is provided through a novel MDSS (Maintenance Decision Support System). The final goal of the project is to quantitatively demonstrate that the implemented MDSS is capable to minimize the consumption of chemical anti-icing reagents (e. g. sodium chloride) and the associated environmental (water and air) impact while maintaining the current high levels of road safety. In the CLEAN-ROADS system RSTs have been forecast by applying the numerical model METRo (Model of the Environment and Temperature of Roads) to a network of RWIS (Road Weather Information System) stations installed on a test route in the Adige Valley (Italy). This forecast is however local and does not take into account typical peculiarities along road network, such as the presence of road sections that are particularly prone to ice formation. <b>Thermal</b> <b>mapping,</b> i. e. the acquisition of mobile RST measurements through infrared thermometry, permits to (i) identify and map those sections, and (ii) extend the forecast from a RWIS station to adjacent areas. The processing of <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> signals is however challenging because of random variations in the road surface emissivity. To overcome this we have acquired several <b>thermal</b> <b>mapping</b> traces along the test route during winter seasons 2014 - 2015 and 2015 - 2016.
