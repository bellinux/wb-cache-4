5|$|The Korean Peninsula {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{since the end of}} World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) {{consisted}} of only 132 aircraft and 2,000 personnel, of whom only 80 were pilots and most poorly trained. The <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> had very small air forces of their own, with the North Koreans' 132 aircraft organized into the KPAF 1st Air Division. At the early {{phase in the}} war, these aircraft were used boldly to the North Koreans' advantage. Aware of their air superiority over the Republic of Korea Air Force and not expecting UN intervention, they anticipated light resistance in the air. In all, the KPAF had 2,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of {{the border between the}} <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> and could be crossed in either {{direction}} throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E

5|$|The second crisis, {{known as}} the axe murder incident, {{occurred}} at Panmunjom, a village which stands in the DMZ between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea. Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's Joint Security Area. The attack coincided with {{a meeting of the}} Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at which Kim Jong-il, the son of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.|$|E
25|$|An {{historic}} {{event was}} held in 1990 when North Korea accepted the proposal for exchange between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas,</b> resulting in high-level talks, and cultural and sports exchanges. In 1991, a joint communiqué on denuclearization was agreed upon, and the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> simultaneously became members of the UN.|$|E
25|$|The government's stance towards North Korea was not {{to violate}} the {{agreement}} made between {{the heads of the}} <b>two</b> <b>Koreas,</b> but to mull over the economic feasibility and realizable possibility through negotiation based on mutual trust and respect, and prioritizing going forward with the project.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{continuation}} of the Sunshine Policy under the Roh administration, it was eventually declared a failure by the Ministry of Unification in November 2010 over issues of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, stymied further negotiations, and newly strained relations between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until the 1970s, Chongryon was the {{dominant}} Zainichi group, {{and in some}} ways remains more politically significant today in Japan. However, the widening disparity between the political and economic conditions of the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> has since made Mindan, the pro-South Korean group, the larger and less politically controversial faction.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} {{ended on}} 27 July 1953, when an armistice was signed. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone to separate North and South Korea, {{and allowed the}} return of prisoners. However, no peace treaty has been signed, and according to some sources the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> are technically still at war.|$|E

25|$|François de Grossouvre (29 March 1918 – 7 April 1994) was a French {{politician}} {{charged in}} 1981 by newly elected president François Mitterrand with overseeing {{national security and}} other sensitive matters, in particular those concerning Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, Morocco, Gabon, the Persian Gulf countries, Pakistan and the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> He was also {{in charge of the}} French branch of Gladio, NATO's stay-behind paramilitary secret armies during the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the formation of a Korean Economic Community could be a way to ease in unification of the Korean peninsula. Lee Myung-bak, departing from the Saenuri Party's traditional hardline stance, has outlined a comprehensive diplomatic package on North Korea that includes setting up a consultative body to discuss economic projects between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> He proposed seeking a Korean economic community agreement to provide the legal and systemic basis for any projects agreed to in the body.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{between the}} <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> have been {{strained}} in recent years, with provocative actions taken {{under the rule}} of Kim Jong-il (such as the suspected torpedoing of the ROKS Cheonan and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island) and his son, Kim Jong-un (such as the rocket launches in April and December of 2012 and North Korea's third nuclear test). Kim Jong-un's sudden accession and limited experience governing have also stoked fears about power struggles among different factions leading to future instability on the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|Table For Two International {{was founded}} in 2007. It is an {{international}} nonprofit organization. It was started from Table For Two International in Japan at first. It has been expending to the USA, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, India, Korea and so on. TFT has relation with 400 partners such as companies, universities, restaurants, public institutions and so on. Until 2012, TFT is going to offer 106 million meals to Africa children. Table For <b>Two</b> <b>Korea</b> was started from 2011 as a nonprofit organization and it has extended its boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Table For <b>Two</b> <b>Korea</b> (TFT) is {{a project}} that aims {{to solve the problem}} about {{unbalanced}} food distribution between developed countries and developing countries with one meal. In the world, about one billion people who live in developed countries have problem with hyper nutrition and about one billion other people who live in developing countries are suffering from starvation and malnutrition. TFT suggests one solution to solve these two problems with only one meal. If people who live in advanced countries eat a TFT meal reduced calorie, people who live in less developed countries can have one meal in the school with a donation form the calorie.|$|R

25|$|The {{industrialization}} of the Korean Peninsula {{began with}} the Joseon dynasty (in particular with King, and later Emperor, Gojong) while Korea was still independent but accelerated under Japanese occupation. It {{continues to be the}} subject of controversy between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> and Japan. The manner of the acceleration of industrialization under Japanese occupation, especially the utilization of industrialization only for the purposes of benefiting Japan, the exploitation of the Korean people in their own country, the marginalization of Korean history and culture, the environmental exploitation of the Korean Peninsula, and its long-term negative repercussions for modern-day North and South Korea are among the most provocative aspects of the controversy.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{with the}} North {{improved}} and a summit meeting was planned, but postponed indefinitely {{with the death}} of Kim Il-sung. Tensions varied between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> thereafter, with cycles of small military skirmishes and apologies. The government also carried out substantial financial and economical reforms, joining the OECD in 1996, but encountered difficulties with political and financial scandals which involves his son. The country also faced a variety of catastrophes which claimed many lives: a train collision and a ship sinking in 1993, and the Seongsu Bridge and Sampoong Department Store collapses in 1994 and 1995. These incidents were a blow to the civilian government.|$|E
25|$|The {{country now}} divided, the {{relationship}} between the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> turned more antagonistic as time passed. The Soviet forces having withdrawn in 1948, North Korea pressured the South to expel the United States forces, but Rhee sought to align his government strongly with America, and against both North Korea and Japan. Although talks towards normalization of relations with Japan took place, they achieved little. Meanwhile, the government took in vast sums of American aid, in amounts sometimes near the total size of the national budget. The nationalist government also continued many of the practices of the U.S. military government. In 1948, the Rhee government repressed military uprisings in Jeju, Suncheon and Yeosu. About 30,000 local people were gunned down.|$|E

25|$|Crossing {{the inner}} German border {{remained}} possible throughout the Cold War; {{it was never}} entirely sealed in the fashion of {{the border between the}} <b>two</b> <b>Koreas,</b> though there were severe restrictions on the movement of East German citizens. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river links. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions and harassment of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift– and Allied military convoys could pass through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E

He followed Mitterrand to the Elysée Palace in 1981, was appointed in June chargé de mission (operations manager) and then conseiller du président (counsellor of the president) of President Mitterrand, who entrusted him with security and other sensitive matters, in particular related to Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, Morocco, Gabon, the Gulf countries, Pakistan and the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas.</b> He travelled a lot, in particular to Arab countries where {{he worked in the}} arms trade. His relations with Gemayel and Syrian president Hafez el Assad enabled him to assist in the negotiations for French hostages in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|P. vivax is {{the only}} {{indigenous}} malaria parasite on the Korean peninsula. In the years following the Korean War (1950–53), malaria-eradication campaigns successfully {{reduced the number of}} new cases of the disease in North Korea and South Korea. In 1979, World Health Organization declared the Korean peninsula vivax malaria-free, but the disease unexpectedly re-emerged in the late 1990s and still persists today. Several factors contributed to the re-emergence of the disease, including reduced emphasis on malaria control after 1979, floods and famine in North Korea, emergence of drug resistance and possibly global warming. Most cases are identified along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. As such, vivax malaria offers the <b>two</b> <b>Koreas</b> an opportunity to work together on an important health problem that affects both countries.|$|E
