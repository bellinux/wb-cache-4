5|$|Everton {{spent the}} week before the match in <b>the</b> <b>spa</b> town of Buxton, and {{travelled}} to Dorking {{on the eve of the}} match. Manchester City spent the week in Bushey. Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was troubled by a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E

5|$|Several {{areas of}} Bath had {{undergone}} development during the Stuart period, and development increased during Georgian times {{in response to}} the increasing number of visitors to <b>the</b> <b>spa</b> and resort town who required accommodation. The architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone used for construction throughout the city was obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764).|$|E
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince the court that since the penalty was {{in the form of}} time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for <b>the</b> <b>Spa</b> incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E

Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips, were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and what remained of the manorial rights were purchased by the borough council.|$|E
5|$|Further {{controversy}} ensued at the Belgian Grand Prix at <b>the</b> <b>Spa</b> circuit. The circuit {{had been}} paved {{just days before}} the race, creating a track that many of the racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to the surface. Roberts and the new championship points leader, Virginio Ferrari, instigated a riders' revolt and refused to race. Once again, the FIM responded by suspending Roberts and Ferrari. The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to the press about forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E

5|$|The 1966 world {{championship}} season opened with the Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham {{was affected by}} a cold, and qualified poorly before retiring when the BT19's gearbox failed. Surtees led the race in his Ferrari before his differential failed on lap 15; the race was won by Jackie Stewart in a 2-litre BRM P261. At the following Belgian Grand Prix at <b>the</b> <b>Spa</b> circuit, Brabham survived an enormous 135miles per hour (215km/h) slide in the rain on the first lap. The shower eliminated half the field, including Stewart, who would miss the next race with his injuries. The BT19, using Goodyear tyres that were not suited to the conditions, came home fourth of five classified finishers. Surtees won the race for Ferrari, the last before he quit the Italian team.|$|E

5|$|Tunbridge Wells West {{station was}} opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1866 as the {{terminus}} of its competing line to Tunbridge Wells, but closed in 1985 {{along with that}} line. The station building—a Grade II listed building—is now a restaurant, and a Sainsbury's supermarket occupies the former goods yard. In 1996, however, part of the line was reopened by the Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society, which now—as <b>the</b> <b>Spa</b> Valley Railway—operates a steam heritage railway that runs from Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge via High Rocks and Groombridge. The western end of the service was extended from Groombridge to Eridge, on the London-Uckfield line of Southern Railway, on 25 March 2011, serving a platform at Eridge which had been disused for many years.

After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother.

Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like <b>the</b> <b>spa,</b> but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
5|$|In {{this very}} tense {{atmosphere}} {{it was decided}} that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation {{declared a state of emergency}} in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very tense, with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of <b>the</b> <b>Spa</b> Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9% of the population.

40|$|A simple {{procedure}} for the selective {{isolation of the}} protective species-specific protein antigens (SPAs) of Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii was developed to permit use of <b>the</b> <b>SPAs</b> in <b>the</b> immunodiagnosis and immunoprophylaxis of typhus infections. Although <b>the</b> <b>SPAs</b> were readily extracted from lysozyme- or detergent-treated rickettsiae, as measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis, other polypeptides were also present, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast, both water and seven buffers, each at a 10 mM concentration and pH 7. 6, were nearly equally effective in the selective release of <b>the</b> <b>SPAs</b> from whole cells by extraction for 30 min at 45 degrees C. High-ionic-strength buffers and MgCl 2 abolished this SPA release, thus suggesting that divalent cations were important in the binding of <b>the</b> <b>SPAs</b> to <b>the</b> cell envelope. The efficacy of the dilute buffer extraction {{procedure for}} isolation of large amounts of SPAs was tested by further characterization of the supernatants obtained by centrifugation (200, 000 x g) of two successive tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer (Tris) extracts. With this procedure, between 10 and 15 mg of SPA was obtained from 100 mg of purified rickettsiae. Although low-molecular-weight ribonucleic acid fragments were released into the Tris extracts in significant amounts, only <b>the</b> <b>SPAs</b> were detected, in significant quantities, as measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and rocket immunoelectrophoresis. The Tris extracts contained the same major and minor SPA polypeptides as those observed previously in SPA preparations obtained by extensive diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column chromatography, but <b>the</b> Tris <b>SPAs</b> were more satisfactory antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay...|$|R
