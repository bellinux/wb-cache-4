40|$|AbstractThe type {{concept of}} the logic {{programming}} language PROTOS-L supports sorts, subsort relationships, and parametric polymorphism. Due to the order-sortedness, types are also present at run time, replacing parts of the deduction process required in an unsorted version by efficient type computations. Together with the polymorphism, most of the flexibility of untyped logic programming carries over the order-sorted approach. The operational semantics of PROTOS-L is based on polymorphic order-sorted resolution. Starting from an abstract specification, we show how this operational semantics can be implemented efficiently by {{an extension of the}} Warren Abstract machine, and give a detailed description of all instructions and low-level procedures responsible for <b>type</b> <b>handling.</b> Since the extension leaves the WAM's AND/OR structure unchanged, it allows for all WAM optimizations like last call optimization, environment trimming, etc. Moreover, the extension is orthogonal in the sense that any program part not exploiting the facilities of computing with subtypes is executed with almost the same efficiency as on the original WAM...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increasing}} interest {{in the application of}} constraint solving techniques to the field of testing and analysis of software systems. A significant part of constraint-based techniques have been proposed and investigated in program analysis (static and dynamic), structural testing, model-based testing, property-oriented testing, etc. These applications also introduced specific issues which was at the root of dedicated constraint solving techniques. Among these issues, we may cite the requirement for heterogeneous <b>type</b> <b>handling,</b> the ability to deal with control structure, or the need to solve constraints over specific domains like the floating-point numbers. Thus, we initiated this workshop with the hope that people coming from these communities could meet together to exchange experiences and fruitful ideas which can enhance their current and future works. The need for such a workshop has raised from our discussions within the V 3 F project. This project started three years ago with the aim to address the specific features of floating-point computations in critical software verification and validation. The underlying technology of the project was based on constraint solving techniques ove...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that major pollution problems and potential hazardous consequences now exist worldwide. Such concerns have {{lead to increased}} efforts in pollution transport and diffusion modeling by many researchers (Pielke, 1984; Domenico and Schwartz, 1990). A rapid h-adaptive finite element model has been developed to calculate 2 - and 3 -D environmental fluid flow and species transport. The model runs on enhanced PCs, SGI workstations, and Cray class supercomputers. The employment of adapting, unstructured meshes permits one to accurately solve large problems with a reduced number of nodal points. This is accomplished by concentrating (refining) nodes in those regions {{where most of the}} activity takes place, and unrefining in regions where solutions are smooth. However, the key to successful implementation of adaptive mesh techniques is in the choice of element <b>type,</b> <b>handling</b> of interface transitions, and rapid mesh refinement and unrefinement operations during the transient solution. Adaptive techniques are currently being used to simulate a wide range of complex flows, e. g., groundwater transport in porous media (Pepper and Stephenson, 1995), atmospheric transport over complex terrain (Pepper and Carrington, 1995), and compressible flows with shock capture (Devloo et al., 1988) ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 85 - 88) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxi, 90 leavesThere {{has been}} a surge {{in the number of}} digital audio and video content in recent years. Advances in the compression and storage technologies and improvements in the speed of internet connection have enabled widespread use of multimedia content. A wide variety of devices have been introduced to decode and play these media contents. Initially designed as a mere voice communication device, the mobile phones nowadays come equipped with a variety of multimedia capabilities including media players despite their limited system resources. Nowadays, huge servers host dramatically increased audio and video contents Users prefer to watch these contents while streaming rather than downloading them first. So, streaming media players are responsible to present multimedia contents without annoying interrupts. This thesis firstly introduces challenges in design and implementation of a streaming media player and then proposes solutions. Main challenges are keeping audio-video synchronization and server-client synchronization and detecting stream <b>type,</b> <b>handling</b> of multithreaded operations and buffer management. Audio-video synchronization problem is solved by using audio as master stream. Server-client synchronization problem is solved by designing a playback mechanism that keeps synchronization with the server by tuning the playback rate of a streaming media without losing lip-sync between audio and video. The proposed streaming player also has a feature of identifying the type of a media stream very rapidly without using a discrete stream inspector module. The presented design is heavily multithreaded which is implemented on Linux platform, moreover it is also convenient for and implementable on any multithreaded platform...|$|E
