40|$|The {{grading plan}} of a highway is mainly {{determined}} by the alignment, profile, cross sections, and drainage requirements of the highway. In {{the case of an}} intersection, the grading is determined through the consideration of the aforementioned elements of intersecting highways as a whole with adjacent roads, structures, and surrounding topography.

40|$|Geometric cross {{sections}} for state highways {{are governed by}} functional classification criteria, traffic volume, and whether the highway is in a rural or an urban area. (See Chapter 1140 for information on functional class.) Consider High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes when continuous through lanes are to be added {{within the limits of}} an urban area with a population over 200, 000 (see Chapter 1410). When a state highway within an incorporated city or town is a portion of a city street, develop the design features in cooperation with the local agency. (See Chapter 1140 for guidance on geometric design data when a state highway within an incorporated city or town is a portion of a city street.)

40|$|High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) {{facilities}} include separate HOV roadways, HOV lanes, transit lanes, HOV {{direct access}} ramps, and flyer stops. The objectives for the HOV facilities are: • Improve {{the capability of}} corridors to move more people by {{increasing the number of}} people per vehicle. • Provide travel time savings and a more reliable trip time to HOV lane users. • Provide travel options for HOVs without adversely affecting the generalpurpose lanes. Plan, design, and construct HOV facilities that provide intermodal linkages. Give consideration to future highway system capacity needs. Whenever possible, design HOV lanes so that the level of service for the general-purpose lanes is not degraded. In urban corridors that do not currently have planned or existing HOV lanes, complete an analysis of the need for HOV lanes before proceeding with any projects for additional general-purpose lanes. In corridors where both HOV and generalpurpose facilities are planned, construct the HOV lane before or simultaneously with the construction of new general-purpose lanes.

After Colfax Street, Arden Way gains it major thoroughfare status, intersecting Del Paso Boulevard (old US 40) and running parallel with the Regional Transit light rail tracks and a residential frontage street of Arden Way up until Royal Oaks Drive. It passes two light rail stations: The Arden/Del Paso station and the Royal Oaks station. Arden Way then travels over the light rail and Union Pacific railroad tracks at a large overpass, where the <b>roadway</b> <b>turns</b> southeast towards the interchange of Business 80 (also known as the Capital City Freeway) and Highway 160, known locally as the Arden Y.
