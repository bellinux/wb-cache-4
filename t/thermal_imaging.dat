5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. <b>Thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis The {{night sky}} remains a largely {{unexplored}} frontier for biologists studying {{the behavior and}} physiology of freeranging, nocturnal organisms. Conventional imaging tools and techniques such as night-vision scopes, infraredreflectance cameras, flash cameras, and radar provide insufficient detail for the scale and resolution demanded by field researchers. A new tool is needed {{that is capable of}} imaging noninvasively in the dark at high-temporal and spatial resolution. <b>Thermal</b> infrared <b>imaging</b> represents the most promising such technology that is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe and document the behavior of free-ranging organisms in the dark.

40|$|Intracellular {{biopolymer}} networks perform many essential {{functions for}} living cells. Most of these networks show a highly nonlinear mechanical response that originates from the properties if the indi-vidual filaments {{and the network}} architecture. While much theoretical {{work has been done}} to connect the macroscopic response to specific network properties, such as filament persistence length, cross-linking geometry and pore size, {{there is a lack of}} experimental techniques that can simultaneously determine the structure and the mechanical properties of a network in situ on the single filament level and thus basic assumptions made in theoretical and computer models are untested. Here we describe three-dimensional <b>thermal</b> noise <b>imaging</b> as a novel submicroscopic imaging technique that visualizes biopolymer networks on length scales and under conditions that are inaccessible to any other micro-scopic technique.

40|$|High {{resolution}} <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>imaging</b> is {{a pioneering}} method giving indices of sympathetic activity via the contact-free recording of facial tissues (thermal imprints). Compared to established stress markers, the great {{advantage of this}} method is its non-invasiveness. The goal of our study was to pilot the use of <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>imaging</b> in the classical setting of human stress research. Thermal imprints were compared to established stress markers (heart rate, heart rate variability, finger temperature, alpha-amylase and cortisol) in 15 participants undergoing anticipation, stress and recovery phases of two laboratory stress tests, the Cold Pressor Test and the Trier Social Stress Test. The majority of the thermal imprints proved to be change-sensitive in both tests. While correlations between the thermal imprints and established stress markers were mostly non-significant, the thermal imprints (but not the established stress makers) did correlate with stress-induced mood changes. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that {{in contrast to the}} established stress markers the thermal imprints could not disambiguate anticipation, stress and recovery phases of both tests. Overall, these results suggest that <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>imaging</b> is a valuable method for the estimation of sympathetic activity in the stress laboratory setting. The use of this non-invasive method may be particularly beneficial for covert recordings, in the study of special populations showing difficulties in complying with the standard instruments of data collection and in the domain of psychophysiological covariance research.
