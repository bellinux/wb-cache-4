5|$|Rope dart: <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> dart is {{a weapon}} used in Chinese martial arts. It {{consists}} of a long rope with a metal dart attached at the end. The dart can be thrown as a long range weapon while <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is used to pull the dart backwards. The first written description of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD).|$|E

5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> he had been hanged with around his neck. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E

Variations include using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for a slingshot somersault leg drop and a slingshot springboard (where the attacker leaps onto top of <b>the</b> <b>ropes)</b> diving leg drop. Another variant is when the attacker slingshots onto the opponents neck.|$|R

5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E
5|$|Enraged upon {{learning}} the truth, Tiberius soon ordered more killings. Livilla committed suicide or was {{starved to death}} by her mother Antonia Minor. The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> around her neck. Their bodies were thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E

50|$|According to Herodotus, <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> {{were not}} only used as mooring ropes but also {{supported}} the wooden logs forming the bridge deck which is a rather unusual method of construction. Sailors carefully prevent ropes from chafing or from being pressed by hard objects and thus try to avoid early deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> <b>The</b> constant movement of the ships caused by waves and by the marching troops and the heavy loads of the soldiers and of the earth covering the logs putting pressure on <b>the</b> stretched <b>ropes</b> would have led to an early failure of <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> In addition, this setup would not have allowed to have a flat and even bridge deck. <b>The</b> <b>ropes</b> in between <b>the</b> ships would have sagged under the load {{of the earth and}} of the people which would have caused a constant up and down of the road. On top, the earth would have accumulated {{in the center of the}} sags and thus increased the local load on <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> There was no necessity for this configuration: the space between the ships being only three meters, the gap could easily have been bridged by the logs put from one ship to the next and parallel to <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> This would have been a better basis for the road and would not have had any bad influence on <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|R

Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others to follow him down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope match between Randy Orton and Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes started the match by {{performing}} {{a series of}} elbows on Orton's head. Orton, however, took the advantage after hitting Rhodes' head several times with the cowbell, {{which was in the}} middle of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> connecting the two men. After a final hit to the head, Orton pinned Rhodes to win the match. After the match, Orton attempted to punt Rhodes in the head, but Rhodes' son, Cody, made the save.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

Near {{the end of}} the round, Cooper threw three successive jabs as Ali stood against <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> Ali retreated further against <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> when Cooper unleashed a left hook which struck Ali squarely on his jaw, lifting Ali on impact. Two things happened simultaneously at this stage which saved Ali from a possible knockout. First, the round came to an end. Second, <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> had cushioned Ali's fall.As Cooper later recalled: [...] <b>The</b> <b>ropes</b> let him down gentle. You went from the top, to the middle, to <b>the</b> bottom <b>rope.</b> Now, if that had been {{in the middle of the}} ring, and he'd gone down on his head, that would have shook him up.

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E

Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E
