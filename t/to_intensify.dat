5|$|At around 0000 UTC on July 31, Brenda {{moved into}} Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, it lost its {{tropical}} characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It dissipated by August 1 over southern Canada. Because Brenda {{was in the}} vicinity of land for most of its course, it was not able <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> beyond tropical storm status.|$|E
5|$|On September14, Abby, while moving west-northwest, {{began to}} develop a central dense {{overcast}} and thus began <b>to</b> <b>intensify.</b> On the morning of September15, the JMA upgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. Despite reports from Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicating that low-and upper-level circulations were not properly aligned, both the JTWC and JMA estimated that Abby became a typhoon early on September16.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Gulf of Mexico on August22, the {{tropical}} storm continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify,</b> reaching hurricane strength {{early the next}} day north of the Yucatán Peninsula. A ship in the hurricane's vicinity reported a barometric pressure of 994mbar (hPa; 29.36inHg), and other ships also reported similarly low pressures. Beginning on August24, the system began to curve northwards towards the Louisiana coast {{in response to a}} nearby cold front. The hurricane continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> as it moved northwards, reaching Category2 hurricane intensity the same day and subsequently the equivalent of a Category3 hurricane on August25. A ship reported an eye associated with the system, observing 100mph (160km/h) winds with a pressure of 959mbar (hPa; 28.32inHg) at 2100UTC that day.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} days, the low moved towards {{the west and}} started to regenerate with a circulation center becoming visible early on October 3. Based on this, the EPHC re-upgraded Madeline to a tropical depression. Continuing <b>to</b> <b>intensify,</b> Madeline was soon upgraded to a tropical storm for the second time. During {{the next day or}} two, Madeline remained near stationary before turning towards the northeast on October 5. As the cyclone moved over an area of warm seas surface temperatures, the storm started <b>to</b> <b>intensify.</b> During the next day, Madeline slowly developed an eye before intensifying into a hurricane. In addition, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds 75 mph (120 km/h) winds and a pressure of 984 millibars.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{tropical}} {{depression of the}} season formed {{off the coast of}} Antigua on August 14. Initially, forecasters anticipated the system <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> into a tropical storm; however, a reconnaissance mission into the depression on August15 revealed that it was poorly organized and was declassified a tropical cyclone. Tropical Depression Four peaked at 35mph (55km/h) and dissipated on August 15.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} originated as a tropical depression on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. It continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> steadily, eventually reaching hurricane status on September 24 as it exited the Yucatán Channel. The hurricane continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> as it moved north-northwest and attained Category 2 intensity in the Gulf of Mexico. During the afternoon, the storm intensified further into a major hurricane. At this time, the hurricane was 300 miles (480km) west-northwest of Cuba. The hurricane maintained intensity and continued to drift north-northwest, and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane as it made landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, on September 27. The hurricane weakened as it moved inland, quickly weakening to a tropical storm by September 28. The storm became extratropical on September 29.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify,</b> reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Cilla {{affected}} several {{islands in}} the South Pacific. The cyclone developed from a monsoon trough on January 26 northwest of Fiji, and initially moved to the east in conditions unfavourable for cyclones. After wind shear lessened, Cilla reached its peak intensity on January 28, attaining maximum winds of 75km/h (45mph) sustained over 10minutes. After slightly weakening, Cilla was able <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> again to match this intensity on January 29. Strong vertical wind shear conditions then returned, and Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day on}} August9, Arlene passed {{directly}} over Bermuda with winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> after passing the island, with reconnaissance recorded a minimum pressure of 969mbar (hPa; 28.61inHg) and maximum winds reached 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane began to weaken hours later, with winds decreasing below 100mph (155km/h) by the afternoon of August10. Shortly after, Arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while maintaining hurricane-force winds, over the north Atlantic. The remnants were absorbed by a larger cyclone near Newfoundland on August11.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1160s, Foliot {{also served as}} a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, but left the archbishop's service as Becket's dispute with the king began <b>to</b> <b>intensify.</b> He was elected to Hereford in 1173, and served as a royal and papal judge while bishop.

5|$|Humberto {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> on {{the morning}} of the 23rd as the central dense overcast became well defined, despite the lack of a clear eye feature. However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow interfered with that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined eye, as it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while still moving west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E

Upon moving ashore, the depression produced a storm surge of 2–4ft (0.6–1.2m) along the southern coastline of Texas.

At {{the same time the}} JMA were reporting that Rammasun had winds of 150km/h (90mph). The typhoon then continued <b>to</b> <b>intensify</b> quickly with the JMA reporting that Rammasun had winds of 160km/h (100mph), the JTWC then reported that Rammasun had become a Category 4 typhoon with winds of 225km/h (140mph).
