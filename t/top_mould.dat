5000|$|The {{process is}} multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is {{vertically}} heat extruded through a circular throat {{to form a}} hanging tube called the parison. This extruded tube is then enclosed within a two-part mould, and the tube is cut above the mould. The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or sterile filling space, where filling needles (mandrels) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould. Following {{the formation of the}} container, the mandrel is used to fill the container with liquid. Following filling the mandrels are retracted and a secondary <b>top</b> <b>mould</b> seals the container. All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution.|$|E
40|$|Vertical direct chill (VDC) casting of {{aluminium}} alloys is a mature process that has evolved over many decades through gradual change to both equipment design and casting practice. Today, air-pressurised, continuous lubrication, hot <b>top</b> <b>mould</b> systems with advanced station automation are selected as the process of choice for producing extrusion billet. Specific sets of operating parameters are employed on these stations for each alloy and size combination to produce optimal billet quality. The designs and parameters are largely derived from past experience and accumulated know-how. Recent experimental work at the University of Queensland has concentrated on understanding {{the way in which}} the surface properties of liquid aluminium alloys, e. g., surface tension, wetting angle and oxide skin strength, influence the size and shape of the naturally-stab le meniscus for a given alloy, temperature and atmosphere. The wide range of alloy-and condition-dependent values measured has led to the consideration of how these properties impact the stability of the enforced molten metal meniscus within the hot <b>top</b> <b>mould</b> cavity. The actual shape and position of the enforced meniscus is controlled by parameters such as the upstream conduction distance (UCD) from sub-mould cooling and the molten metal head. The degree of deviation of this actual meniscus from the predicted stable meniscus is considered to be a key driver in surface defect formation. This paper reports on liquid alloy property results and proposes how this knowledge might be used to better design VDC mould systems and casting practices...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} machining of miniature components {{is an interesting}} and very challenging task. Machining of miniature components will take long lead {{time to get the}} required size and tolerance due to the limitations of size of the machining tool and limited material removal rate. This paper presents the process of machining metal mould using aluminum- 2024 material in 3 -Axis CNC milling machine with enclosed wall of free form surfaces. The mini propeller mould is divided in to two halves namely top and bottom. The <b>top</b> <b>mould</b> has the twisted cavity contours of suction surface of the propeller blade airfoil. The bottom mould has the twisted cavity contours of pressure surface of the propeller blade airfoil. Smooth matching of leading and trailing edges over the span of the blade are also accomplished. To avoid the cutting tool interference during machining of the space between two blades, smooth contours in the mould is given and machined accordingly. The machining operations are divided in to ‘rough machining’ and ‘finishing operation’ to minimize the machining time. To avoid local gouging on the profile, sufficient allowance is kept in comparison to actual material to be removed by leaving extra material for finishing operation. During the finishing operation on the propeller blade profile which consists of free form surface, two boundaries were introduced instead of single boundary method to generate the tool path in span wise direction. The matching of two boundaries profile after finishing operation is within the accepted tolerance of + 0. 04 mm. The machined moulds were inspected and compared with the IGES model of the mould. New machining method adopted here has saved 40 % machining time without compromising in accuracy of machining top and bottom moulds of the propellers. The geometrical accuracies and surface finish of propellers blade obtained through this process are good in comparison to RPT process...|$|E
