It was assumed, that no manager would be capable of supervising more than 5-6 direct subordinates. However, this conclusion built on the assumption, that the superior must actively monitor the work of all subordinates. Later on, this statement was diversified, and Davis (1951) divided managerial work into two categories, one requiring the attention to physical work, the other one requiring mental activity. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision,</b> a span of 3-8 subordinates for managers at higher levels was considered adequate, while first level supervisors, i.e. those supervising shop floor personnel could have up to 30 subordinates.|$|E

The Jewish {{community}} {{requires a}} number of religious institutions for daily life, and it falls to rabbis, with their knowledge of Jewish law, to supervise them to ensure they operate in accordance with Jewish law. Examples would be Jewish slaughter (shekhita), Jewish dietary laws in shops and institutions (kashrut), the ritual bath (mikveh), the elementary school (heder), the Sabbath boundaries (eruvin), and the burial society (hevra kadisha). Traditionally this function fell to the town's rabbi. In the modern era, rabbis who specialize in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> will find full-time employment as a Mashgiach (supervisor of ritual law), {{and some of these}} functions are now performed by national organizations, such as the Orthodox Union which offers kosher certification.|$|E

In 1852 Massachusetts appointed a commission and California, Connecticut, Indiana, Missouri, New York and Vermont either established a separate insurance department or vested the power to regulate insurance in an existing agency. Shortly thereafter, other states followed until by 1871 nearly every state had [...] "some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> and control over insurance companies."

The physical interactions that officers have with the inmates is minimal, {{for most of the}} communication comes through an intercom system. Inmates are placed in their own cells and officers have physical barriers to ensure their own safety. When havoc is wreaked, a call for a response team is placed over the intercom. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> is strong, but has some drawbacks, such as the creation of blind spots. These are created through indirect supervision because the guards standing watch can have objects blocking tiny spots or they may just not be looking in the right direction at the right time.

30|$|A new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> {{pedagogy}} {{emerged from}} the literature review that embraced the notion of creating communities of scholars and resulted in teamwork. This more participatory supervision involved the concepts of connectedness, more intense supervision, and group supervision. The group could be the team of supervisors and the student {{or a group of}} peers (fellow postgraduate students) {{that may or may not}} be combined with outside experts in the field. As noted above (Lee, 2008), central to many of the new approaches to supervision was the idea of enculturation into a disciplinary community (whether it was a single discipline or multi/transdisciplinary); this approach was integrated with emancipation in which graduate students found their professional ‘voice’ (Lee, 2008). In this instance, the term ‘voice’ refers to becoming active as independent researchers in their own right and not tied to their supervisor’s reputation or research agenda.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to perform}} the {{cultural}} adaptation to Portuguese of the Nursing Clinical Facilitators Questionnaire (NCFQ), which was designed by the Centre for Learning and Teaching at the University of Technology of Sydney, and to validate this instrument. Methods: this methodological study involved the cultural adaptation of the questionnaire by using translation, back-translation, semantic comparison, idiomatic and conceptual equivalence, and validation through validity and reliability analyses and used a sample of 767 students in their second year of the Nursing Program. Results: construct validity had a two-factor solution according to the varimax rotation method. In addition, there was a high overall internal consistency for the questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha of 0. 977) and for the factors found (0. 966 and 0. 952, respectively).

Therefore, the Neural Gas was successfully used in classification problems. In this paper we present a novel method to learn the Neural Gas with fully and partially labelled data sets.

Hesitation process is based on neuron’s class membership probability and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
