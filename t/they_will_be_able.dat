5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded {{in the years}} since its beginning, it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to manipulate water.|$|E

5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not {{become part of}} the Final Fantasy series until Final Fantasy XI. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional Final Fantasy game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the Final Fantasy series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the Active Time Battle system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused Conditional Turn-Based Battle system. Originally, Final Fantasy X was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in Final Fantasy X come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen {{at the end of an}} event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{amount of}} water needed for the dough depends on the final shape of the pasta. Long pastas should have less {{moisture}} content (and therefore less water) so <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are piston pumps in which the water flow rate is controlled by adjusting the piston stroke, screw feeder, and gear and lobe pumps where {{the speed of the}} rotation determines the water flow. In more advanced systems, electronic devices are used to regulate the water flow.|$|E
