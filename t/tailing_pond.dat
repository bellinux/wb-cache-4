5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large <b>tailing</b> <b>pond</b> owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east–west rail lines, the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the Great Salt Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the Great Salt Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the oil sands development, there have been several leaks into the Athabasca River polluting it with oil and <b>tailing</b> <b>pond</b> water. The close proximity of the tailing ponds to the river drastically increases the likelihood of contamination due to ground water leakages. In 1997, Suncor admitted that their tailing ponds had been leaking [...] of toxic water into the river a day. This water contains naphthenic acid, trace metals such as mercury and other pollutants. The Athabasca River is the largest freshwater delta in the world but with Suncor and Syncrude leaking tail ponds the amount of polluted water will exceed 1 billion cubic meters by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife {{living near}} the Athabasca River have been greatly {{impacted}} due to pollutants entering the water system. An {{unknown number of}} birds die each year. Particularly visible and hard hit are migrating birds that stop to rest at <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds.</b> There have been numerous reports of large flocks of ducks landing in <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> and perishing soon after.

50|$|Presently, the 700 MW {{reversible}} hydro turbines (7 x 100 MW) {{located at}} the toe of Nagarjuna Sagar Dam are unable to operate in pumping mode due to non availability of <b>tail</b> <b>pond</b> for storing the released water during the power generation mode. With the completion of <b>tail</b> <b>pond,</b> surplus electricity from the electricity grid {{would be used for}} pumping the water back to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir and recycled for meeting peaking load on daily basis. Thus surplus electricity is consumed when it is available and used to meet the peak electricity requirements without letting the water out of the Nagarjuna Sagar <b>tail</b> <b>pond.</b> 700 MW peaking power for eight hours duration can be met from the one Tmcft of live storage water capacity available in the <b>tail</b> <b>pond.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{project is}} also called Dummugudem to Sagar <b>tail</b> <b>pond</b> lift canal project. The canal starts from Dummugudem pond at [...] to Nagarjuna Sagar <b>tail</b> <b>pond</b> located across the Krishna River. This lift canal is an inter river basin {{transfer}} link by feeding Godavari river {{water from the}} Dummugudem pond to Krishna river basin {{to the extent of}} 165 tmcft. The total length of the canal is 244 km and the capacity of the canal is 22,000 cusecs to feed 165 tmcft water in three months duration of the monsoon season. Presently, the canal is planned to terminate at [...] by feeding the water into the Halia river to reach the downstream Nagarjuna Sagar <b>tail</b> <b>pond.</b> The required pumping head is 128 meters for the elevation difference of 30 meters between Dummugudem pond (45 MSL) and Nagarjuna Sagar <b>tail</b> <b>pond</b> (75 MSL). Dummugudem pond to Nagarjuna Sagar <b>tail</b> <b>pond</b> link canal is entirely located in Telangana State and needs to be routed through high lands which necessitated more pumping head.|$|R
2500|$|Suncor {{invested}} $1.2 {{billion in}} their Tailings Reduction Operations (TROTM) method [...] that treats mature fine tails (MFT) from tailings ponds with chemical flocculant, an anionic Polyacrylamide, {{commonly used in}} water treatment plants to improve removal of total organic content (TOC), to speed their drying into more easily reclaimable matter. Mature tailings dredged from a pond bottom in suspension were mixed with a polymer flocculant and spread over a [...] "beach" [...] with a shallow grade where the tailings would dewater and dry under ambient conditions. The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would {{reduce the number of}} tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a <b>tailing</b> <b>pond</b> from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with land rehabilitation continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations. For the reporting periods from 2010 to 2012, Suncor had a lower-than-expected fines capture performance from this technology.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{the issue}} of safe {{production}} of <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> has become a common social problem facing China.

On the basis of the structure of the <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> on-line monitoring system, this paper systematically studied the dam displacement GPS on-line monitoring method and the vibrating wire type saturation line on-line monitoring method with regard to the technical indicators for the dam displacement and saturation line that should be observed for <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> rated at Class IV or higher, and come up with the structure and fulfilling means for the on-line monitoring system of these two indicators.

40|$|Mine <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> are {{environmental}} hazards {{because of high}} susceptibility to leaching and erosion by water and wind. Vegetation establishment is an effective technique to reclaim <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> but requires knowledge of the spatial relationship between the structural composition and {{physical and chemical properties}} of soils. In this study we have demonstrated the use of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), combined with soil chemical analyses, to determine the structural and chemical composition of mine <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> to assess efficient measures of environmental protection. We used a Syscal R 1 resistivity meter to generate two-and three-dimensional (2 -D/ 3 -D) ERI images from El Lirio and Brunita mine <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds.</b> Soil samples were collected at 1 -m intervals to a depth of 15 m, and were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity and cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) contents. Results show that materials in the ponds can be classified into three categories: fine tailings – low ER (, 8 V-m), coarse waste rock – intermediate ER (8 – 150 V-m), and bedrock – high ER (. 150 V-m). Our interpretation of the 2 -D/ 3 -D ERI images with respect to the historical depositions of materials in the ponds show that at El Lirio, decant water outlet was initially at the center and advance...|$|R

Economics was behind the discharging of this material, resulting in <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> created in inappropriate areas. There is an ongoing process of depositing tailings on old <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds,</b> although no special {{attention has been paid to}} the subsequent effect on the environment. Application of intelligent multi-criteria analysis AHP and PROMETHEE has been performed in this paper for the purpose of ranking the degree of negative impact on the environment of <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds.</b> Analysis is performed for five <b>tailing</b> <b>ponds</b> of MMCC (Mining Metallurgy Chemical Combine) “Trepča”, whereby two of the ponds are active and three inactive. The ponds are in relatively close proximity to the municipalities of Zvečan and Kosovska Mitrovica, to the north of Kosovo and Metohija, Republic of Serbia. In order to achieve the most objective results, the AHP and PROMETHEE methods were applied. By using these methods for calculations, the following ranking for the flotation tailing waste deposits was obtained, regarding their environmental impact: Žitkovac, Tvrđanski Do, Bostanište, Gornje Polje and Žarkov Potok. This result can contribute to the decision-making process of a prioritizing strategy for rehabilitation and remediation of these five flotation tailings.
