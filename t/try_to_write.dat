5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E

The rules for a six-contestant game are the same as on the TV show (with similar scoring, such as receiving points for matching two answers and more points for matching all three answers), but the home game also has variations for fewer than six contestants.

25|$|Some Christian {{artists as}} Third Day, Kutless, Thousand Foot Krutch and Disciple have sung songs that carry overtly Christian messages. Bands such as Underoath, Blessthefall and Haste the Day {{incorporate}} symbolism and Christian messages more indirectly. Bands such as Flyleaf {{do not call}} themselves Christian bands, though they state that their Christian faith affects their lyrics. Bands such as Switchfoot have said they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> music for both Christians and non-Christians alike.|$|E
25|$|Playing shows {{late into}} the night, and living {{with his wife and}} young child in his tiny apartment, Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there. Songwriter Joe Melson, an {{acquaintance}} of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> some songs together. In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison and Melson recorded seven songs at RCA Nashville, with Atkins producing, but only two were judged worthy of release by RCA; Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of producer Fred Foster at Monument Records.|$|E

On June 27, 2011, [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was the twelfth song to be made available. In the accompanying quote, Beyoncé said: [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs that will {{bring out the best}} in all of us and keep us close together.

500|$|Hensleigh {{found the}} {{rewriting}} process {{to be too}} difficult and dropped out, and felt he [...] "wasted nine months in pre-production". It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a script for a third time. France claimed [...] "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure {{if this was a}} science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions about turning it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie." [...] France was writing the script on fast track from July—September 1999. Filming for Hulk was to start in April 2000.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{in the basement of}} the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood. [...] Although Kiedis had recently become clean, his withdrawal symptoms increased and affected his musical contributions to the group. After fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis decided to take drugs again as a one-time attempt to celebrate his new music, which led to his resumed addiction. The recording process for the album became difficult as Kiedis would often disappear to seek drugs. [...] Beinhorn recalled that [...] "There were points in pre-production where I really thought the record wasn't gonna get made." [...] Kiedis felt [...] "excruciating pain and guilt and shame" [...] when he would miss a recording session so he would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> lyrics while searching for drugs; although the band was upset by his drug use and frequent disappearances, they were impressed with his musical output at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{market for}} science fiction {{expanded}} dramatically the following year; several new magazines were launched, including Startling Stories in January 1939, Unknown in March (a fantasy companion to Astounding, also edited by Campbell), Fantastic Adventures in May, and Planet Stories in December. [...] All of the competing magazines, including {{the two main}} extant titles, Wonder Stories and Amazing Stories, were publishing space opera, stories of interplanetary adventure, or other well-worn ideas {{from the early days}} of the genre. [...] Campbell's attempts to make science fiction more mature led to a natural division of the writers: those who were unable to write to his standards continued to sell to other magazines; and those who could sell to Campbell quickly focused their attention on Astounding and sold relatively little to the other magazines. [...] The expansion of the market also benefited Campbell because writers knew that if he rejected their submissions, they could resubmit those stories elsewhere; this freed them to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> to his standards.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that {{had happened in the}} past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|Other {{big name}} SF authors {{approached}} LGBT themes in individual works: In Time Enough for Love (1973) by Robert A. Heinlein, {{the main character}} argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex {{for the purpose of}} procreation remains held as the ideal. The female bisexuality in Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a [...] "wrongness" [...] deserving pity. Heinlein's use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled [...] "The Embarrassments of Science Fiction" [...] by SF writer Thomas Disch. Disch was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel On Wings of Song (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his mosaic novel 334, gay people are referred to as [...] "republicans" [...] in contrast to the straight [...] "democrats". However, he did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> to a particular community: [...] "I'm gay myself, but I don't write 'gay' literature." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and wanted to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> [...] "a story {{in the mind of}} a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence. [...] "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," [...] said Jonze. [...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to do that in [...] And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E
500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E

500|$|While {{writing and}} {{recording}} for her debut album, Stefani cited her major influences as Club Nouveau, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure and early Madonna and advised the producers and writers {{that she wanted}} a similar sound for the album. According to MTV's Jennifer Vineyard, musician and songwriter Linda Perry [...] "put Gwen in a headlock" [...] during a party after the Grammys and told her they could make beautiful music together"; however, Stefani felt scared and insecure about working with Perry. While recording at Perry's house, Stefani was initially insecure about her writing process and [...] "would go into another room to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> some lyrics, {{and when she came}} back, Perry would already have the whole song nailed." [...] After a writing session where [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] was created, Stefani became less insecure and felt more comfortable when making songs. After working with other musicians, Stefani and Perry worked together on [...] "The Real Thing". On October 3, 2005, Interscope Records released the song as a promotional single exclusively in the Philippines. The label released a CD single, which featured the album version and a remix by Wendy & Lisa of the song.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on {{all five}} {{original}} songs on Wrapped in Red, {{some of which}} were written in December 2012 to avoid writing Christmas tunes during the 2013 summer season. She co-wrote the opening and title track, [...] "Wrapped in Red", with Ashley Arrison, Aben Eubanks, and Shane McAnally. A Christmas ballad, the song was inspired by a scene in the holiday feature film Love Actually (2003), in which someone confesses unrequited love towards another. Critics singled out the track the one that resonates the Wall of Sound the most. The second track, [...] "Underneath the Tree", was written by Clarkson and Kurstin, making it the first time they had co-written a track together. Clarkson remarked: [...] "Greg and I have worked a lot together, but usually I just come in and I just sing. We've never have actually written a song together at this point. And he and I were like, 'Let's just <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something for the record." [...] RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge remarked that its release as a single was partly inspired by the success of [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] by Mariah Carey. The following track is a rendition of the holiday standard [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", which Clarkson had selected for its saccharine content.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E
