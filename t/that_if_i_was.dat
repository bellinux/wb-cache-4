25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

After impressing during the trial, Haber signed for West Brom {{for an undisclosed}} fee, agreeing to personal terms and passing his medical on January 12, 2010. On joining the club, Haber said that [...] "The club were pretty straightforward with me from day one. They said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> given the opportunity, they would work to improve me as a young player". He was given a squad number of 40.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{became friends}} with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging {{that might have been}} the day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized that I wanted to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Zappa's band." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 1978, Genesis began {{a period}} of {{inactivity}} as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I {{was never going to}} leave the band. It was just <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|E
500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, 2008, Ellison's {{mother died}} of {{complications}} from diabetes, twenty-one months after his great-aunt Alice Coltrane's death. Ellison said, [...] "I decided <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to speak after that experience , it better be something honest, and deeper than a record that was just made for the times.

He had begun cooking, which he described [...] "as my secret passion," [...] after his wife entered politics, likening the recipes he found to the [...] "Dead Sea Scrolls." [...] In an interview Orr noted, [...] "Recipes were like the Dead Sea Scrolls...Kay's a great cook, but I realized with her involvement in politics <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to have home cooking, I {{was going to have}} to do it myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Gardiner {{was only}} {{allowed to vote}} in Metro Council to break ties, he was a voting member of all four policy {{committees}}. The committees would do the early work of working through proposals preparing them for Council. Gardiner prided himself on his work ethic, the same style he had used since his days at high school. [...] "I {{was not going to}} change my way of proceeding. It was more necessary than ever. My diagnosis was <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to get anywhere I had to know more about any given subject than any individual councillor, and more about metropolitan business as than all the members of council combined." [...] Gardiner would wait to speak on important resolutions after others had spoken. When a close vote was anticipated, Gardiner went around the council table, rebutting objections one by one.|$|E
2500|$|Members of the Frist {{family have}} been major donors to Princeton University, {{pledging}} a reported $25 million in 1997 {{for the construction}} of the Frist Campus Center. Frist has said that, a few years after his 1974 graduation from Princeton, [...] "I made a commitment to myself <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever in a position to help pull together the resources to establish a center [...] where there could be an informal exchange of ideas, and to establish an environment that is conducive to the casual exchange of information, I would do so." [...] Daniel Golden, a Wall Street Journal journalist {{and author of the book}} The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges — and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, has suggested that two of Frist's sons (Harrison and Bryan) were admitted to Princeton as recognition of this donation rather than their own academic and extracurricular merit.|$|E
