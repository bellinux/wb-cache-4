40|$|M. Comm. Just as a {{portfolio}} of shares needs to be managed constantly to yield the best return, {{a portfolio}} of property investments {{also needs to be}} managed on a continuous basis for the same reason. Until recently, most institutional property investors didn't have this approach. Properties were managed as assets, and not as investments. One reason for this was that until recently investors could not invest outside South Africa, which caused institutional investors to invest relatively large percentages of their total assets in fixed properties. Investors were caught off guard by changes in the market, and as a result they have properties in their portfolios that are no longer performing well as investments. Institutional investors are now trying to reduce their exposure to properties. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the factors that a property portfolio manager must consider to maximize the return of the portfolio at an acceptable risk. From these factors a questionnaire was developed to evaluate an individual building. The questionnaire was linked to a decision tree by means of a points system. The decision tree can be used by the portfolio manager as a qualitative decision making tool to enhance the property portfolio. According to the points scored, a general classification is given to the building (A-grade to E-grade), as well as on the location, technical aspects, profitability, and potential of the property. There are five possible outcomes to the decision tree: keep the property in the portfolio; keep the property in the portfolio, but do the necessary upgrading; keep the property in the portfolio, do the upgrading, but sell within five years; sell the property as soon as possible; and demolish the existing building, and redevelop the property. The most important criterion for enhancing the portfolio, is the location of the specific property. If the location of the property is classified as "A-grade", the property will be kept in the portfolio, except when the <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> of the property is "E-grade", in which case the building is demolished, and the property redeveloped. If the location of the property is classified as "B-grade", the property will be kept and upgraded if the <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> is not lower than "B-grade". If the location of the property is classified as "B-grade", and the <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> is "C-grade", the portfolio manager should look at the profitability and potential of the building. If the profitability and potential of the of the property is classified as "C-grade" or better, the property should be upgraded, and sold within five years. If the location of the property is classified as "C-grade" or lower, the property should be sold as soon as possible. The portfolio manager should bear in mind that the decision tree does not take economic conditions (for example supply and demand in the property market) and the investor's portfolio enhancement strategy (for example to reduce the portfolio's exposure to a certain type of property), into account. However, the decision tree can be applied to give the portfolio manager an indication whether a specific property should be kept or sold...|$|E

This was particularly highlighted when author Jonathan Franzen, after his book The Corrections was selected, remarked in several publications that some of Oprah's book club picks were middlebrow [...] In her seminal account of the Book-of-the-Month Club (as it was from its inception in 1926 to the 1980s before it transformed to a purely commercial operation), A Feeling for Books, Janice Radway argues that middlebrow culture {{is not simply a}} diluted impersonation of highbrow, but instead distinctly defined itself in defiance of avant-garde high culture. [...] The club provided subscribers with literature selected by expert and ‘generalist’ judges, but held the personal, emotional experience of reading a good book as paramount, while simultaneously maintaining ‘high standards’ for literary quality. In this way, the club was in opposition to the general criticism of middlebrow culture in that it is forced high culture. Instead, Radway demonstrates that the middlebrow culture allows readers to simultaneously access the emotional and intellectual challenges that good reading provides. Radway also identifies the conflicting gender messages sent by the selections. While the club was marketed extensively to the female reader, including its emphasis on the emotional pleasure of books, the focus on intellectual, academic literature of the middlebrow trapped the reader into the constrictive masculine standards of value, classifying ‘great books’ as those that fell in line with male, <b>technical</b> <b>classifications</b> of excellence.|$|R

40|$|The International Patent Classification (IPC) gives a {{fundamental}} {{importance to the}} distinction between function and application. This distinction constitutes {{one of the most}} important classifying rules for patent documents. Most indexing languages do not follow this principle [...] they deal with this difference by selecting supplementary exact terms or by establishing more definite multiple-term syntagms. End-users have to formulate their searches with relevant terms or a combination of them. With so many different principles, is a connection between scientific information and technical information based only on the IPC still relevant? In this paper, we present a study which attempts to show that the lack of formal distinction between function and application, in the case of thematic indexing, does not create ambiguities. Moreover, at the same time, it allows one to select bibliographic references which only refer to functional aspects and references which only refer to applications. By means of a few examples, we endeavour to show that the distinction between function and application can be advantageously exploited by using both this <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> and the indexing of scientific databases. Additionally, this distinction provides the opportunity to explore one of the multiple paths between the documentary representation of the scientific literature and the documentary representation of the technical literature. ...|$|E
40|$|The classifications {{of trees}} are mainly based on {{descriptive}} (attributive) characters {{and they have}} a great significance in thinning. In forestry practice (tree marking for felling, forest inventory, etc) in the Republic of Srpska, the most frequently applied classifications are silvicultural-technical (UT) and <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> of trees, which are based on the knowledge of tree species, stem diameter and stem quality. In IUFRO classification, based on the silvicultural role of trees, and in UT classification, the trees are classified in three categories.

Economic losses in spruce plantations occur because of untimely tending, especially thinning, which has multiple adverse effects on tree quality.

This article {{proposes a}} reexamination of traditional micro-economic wage theory, {{centered on the}} formation of wage structure within firms. Two fundamental questions are explored: Why is there a division of workers into wage classes and what factors account for the size of wage differentials between groups of workers?Starting from the assumption of utility maximization, the author shows that wage differentials derive from employers' attempts to equalize labor cost to labor revenue (productivity) at the margin on the one hand, and from workers' efforts to obtain wage payments compensating for undesirable job conditions. In this view, productivity differentials as well as differing job conditions lead to wage differentials. The author then introduces an additionnal factor in the explanation of wage differentials: segmentation through unequal access to education, training and jobs with a resulting decrease in labor mobility. According to the author, this form of analysis is confronted by three major problems: (1) Instead of an initial assumption, the <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> of jobs and its consequent classification of labour should be considered {{part of what is}} explainable {{as a result of the}} theory itself. (2) Similarly, the theory's assumption that a causal relationship exists between inter-group/inter-individual inequalities and the presence of long-term economic benefits (rents), neglects consideration of the reciprocal nature of this relationship. (3) Lastly, the theory does not permit the measuring of classification differentials, making empirical verifications impossible...|$|E
40|$|Since {{guidelines}} on antibiotic drug treatment often focus on appropriate first choice drugs, assessment of guideline adherence should only {{concentrate on the}} first drug prescribed, and not on subsequent antibiotics prescribed after failure of the first one. PURPOSE: To determine a valid cut-off point for a definition of "first" or "new" prescription in indicators {{for the assessment of}} the quality of antibiotic drug treatment on the basis of pharmaceutical data. METHODS: Three possible definitions for the term "new prescription" were compared, based on three different periods of time, viz. more than 35, 28, or 21 days after starting a previous antibiotic. In an observational study, 1, 225 antimicrobial prescriptions from the medical files of five family practices were audited ("clinical classification") and compared with a classification based on the three definitions ("technical classification"). Agreement between these clinical and technical classifications was determined by calculating Cohen's kappa. The <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> was analyzed as a diagnostic test, using the clinical classification as the gold standard, and sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities were calculated. RESULTS: Defining "new prescription" as "more than 35 days after a previous prescription was issued" resulted in a Cohen's kappa of 0. 93 (95 % CI 0. 92 - 0. 98). The diagnostic value of this definition was extremely high, with a sensitivity of 0. 976, specificity of 0. 987, positive likelihood ratio of 77. 7, and negative likelihood ratio of 0. 02. CONCLUSION: We recommend using a cut-off value of 35 days since the last antimicrobial prescription as the definition of a "new prescription" when no diagnostic information is available, i. e., when using pharmaceutical data to assess the quality of antibiotic prescribing behavior...|$|E
40|$|Archaeological {{research}} {{carried out}} on buildings (Building archaeology, Archeologie du bâti, Bauforschung, Archeologia dell'Architettura) allows the objective representation and description of variety of aspects including: the structure itself, construction techniques, details of the materials used and their state of conservation {{as well as the}} dating of its construction and its historical context. Certain types of stone, bricks and pozzolana present in mortars can be identified by normal observation. However, for an accurate identification of the provenance and make-up of a mortar and the extent of its decay, one is dependant on chemical and petrographic analysis. It is a question of a relationship between archaeology and archaeometry. When the archaeologist states that certain materials have always been used for the construction of port structures, teaching regulations and the transmission of material culture have a bearing on the evolution of the dialogue: it has been possible to study these structures because they have survived for hundreds, if not thousands of years making durability one of their main characteristics. According to Gauss'law, the prolonged use of such materials was not a coincidence but was due to a certain degree of knowledge of these same materials. The questions answerable through archaeometry are thus related to the chemical and mechanical resistance of these materials in a marine environment. If this resistance proves to be stronger in the long term it points to chois made after rational experiments {{over a long period of}} time, even if empirical (choices based on the effects and not to their causes); a process traceable to the Palaeolithic. It is a know fact that, for example, that mortars lime (with magnesium) and cocciopesto or pozzolana are the most resistant if made in the traditional way: today these traditions have been lost because they have not been passed down the generations. But if archaeometry specialists are consulted regarding the cuses of the optimal reaction of mortars in ancient ports, their answer will focus on the 'silico-alluminosi' compound of the lime during setting. If however, if one uses the <b>technical</b> <b>classification</b> of hydraulic binders introduced after the discovery of cements, one notes that the mortars of pozzolana and cocciopesto are considered less resistant, while in reality they have been performed better than hydraulic concrete. If at this point one focuses on the influence of magnesium, the setting properties of these materials and their microstructures one notes that the chemical and physical behaviour of these materials is far more complex than originally thought by researchers in the field. Because of this, and optimal effects rather than for scientists to discover the true methods and procedures.
