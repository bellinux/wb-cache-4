5|$|I., II., and III./KG 55 {{were also}} in action. III./KG 55 bombed Heathrow Airport. Results are unknown and losses are unclear. KG 55 {{suffered}} heavy losses the previous day, so its operations seemed limited. On 12 August it lost 13 Heinkel He 111s and their crews. The next day, 14 August, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Alois Stoeckl.|$|E
5|$|A 2–2 draw in {{the second}} leg meant that Ajax progressed to the quarter-finals {{courtesy}} of a 7–3 aggregate victory. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> to Czech side Dukla Prague 3–2 over two legs. The match marked the emergence of Ajax in European football, two seasons later they reached the final, but lost 4–1 to Milan. They {{would go on to}} win the European Cup three consecutive times in the early 1970s. The match represents Liverpool's record defeat in European competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the strong finish at Los Angeles, who led the Western Conference and overall standings at the time, United failed to win any matches {{during the month of}} June, {{amassing}} three subsequent draws and a loss. The loss would come the following week on 11 June, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> at home against San Jose Earthquakes. Consequently, the loss, along with a Columbus victory, saw United fall to fourth in the conference and 11th in the overall standings.|$|E
50|$|With the loss, Kansas City fell to 1-4. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> also <b>lose</b> Jamaal Charles for the season, as he tore his ACL in this game.|$|R
50|$|The Steelers would {{host the}} AFC Championship Game {{for the third}} time in four years; however, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{ultimately}} <b>lose</b> to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos.|$|R
5000|$|On April 2, 2008, Al Connors and Krieger, {{the only}} DJs still {{working for the}} station, said they were told [...] "restructuring" [...] was planned and <b>they</b> too <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs.|$|R
5|$|Roughly {{three years}} after the {{foundation}} stone laying ceremony, the airport was inaugurated on 14 March 2008 amid protests. The Telugu Desam Party repeated its demand for the naming of the domestic terminal. In addition, on 12 and 13 March, 20,000 AAI employees had conducted a strike against the closure of Begumpet Airport, {{as well as that of}} HAL Airport in Bangalore, fearing <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs.|$|E
5|$|The Sasanians {{would not}} only assume Parthia's legacy as Rome's Persian nemesis, but they would also attempt to restore the {{boundaries}} of the Achaemenid Empire by briefly conquering the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt from the Eastern Roman Empire during the reign of Khosrau II (r.590–628AD). However, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> these territories to Heraclius—the last Roman emperor before the Arab conquests. Nevertheless, for a period of more than 400 years, they succeeded the Parthian realm as Rome's principal rival.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
50|$|The Broncos also <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> in an NFL AFC Divisional Playoff {{match against}} the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium on December 30, 1978, 33-10. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> also <b>lose</b> {{the next season}} to the Houston Oilers 13-7 in a classic NFL Wild Card Playoff match played in the Astrodome on December 23, 1979.|$|R
25|$|As {{it would}} turn out, {{this would be the}} Patriots only playoff loss at Foxboro Stadium. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> not <b>lose</b> another home playoff game again until 31 years later, seven years after Gillette Stadium opened.|$|R
5000|$|If {{they were}} [...] "of the Popish religion" [...] {{and had not}} taken any part in the wars, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> still <b>lose</b> {{a third of their}} lands unless they had {{actually}} fought for the parliament.|$|R
5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed to cover the costs of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats {{did not want to}} lower the tariff so much that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2016 NLA playoffs, Merzlikins led Lugano to the NL final which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} <b>lose</b> in 5 {{games to}} SC Bern. He posted a [...]937 save % and 2.32 goal average in 15 playoffs games.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1999-00 season, former Moccasin Brian Curran was {{selected}} as head coach. Playing a more aggressive style, the team would advance once again to the playoffs where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> subsequently <b>lose</b> {{in the first round}} to Arkansas.|$|R
60|$|Luckily {{there came}} a day of snow, when they must all stay indoors: {{otherwise}} Birkin said, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> all <b>lose</b> their faculties, and begin to utter themselves in cries and shrieks, like some strange, unknown species of snow-creatures.|$|R
5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A key issue was whether a plebiscite {{should be held}} to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore {{the idea of an}} NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} his time in the Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
50|$|Carlisle {{helped lead}} the Pistons to their first 50-win season since 1997, and their first playoff series victory since 1991 by {{defeating}} the Toronto Raptors in five games. <b>They</b> <b>would,</b> however, <b>lose</b> to the Boston Celtics in five games.|$|R
50|$|In {{his second}} season with the Hoosiers, Lemonis {{finished}} the 2016 season 32-24 overall and 15-9 in conference play. Lemonis and the Hoosiers would be invited to the Big Ten Tournament where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> eventually <b>lose</b> to Maryland, in the second round.|$|R
50|$|The Conservatives were {{narrowly}} re-elected in Westminster in the 1986 {{local council}} elections. Fearing that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> eventually <b>lose</b> control {{unless there was}} a permanent change in the social composition of the borough, Porter instituted a secret policy known as 'Building Stable Communities'.|$|R
5|$|Poland and Lithuania formed one state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{from the}} Union of Lublin in 1569 to the Third Partition in 1795. Both Poland and Lithuania regained their {{independence}} {{in the aftermath of}} World War I, but both soon became engaged in territorial disputes over the Suwałki and Vilnius Regions. During the Polish–Soviet War, Poland launched an offensive against the Soviet Union and captured Vilnius (Wilno) during the Vilna offensive in April 1919. Lithuanians described Vilnius as their historical capital and {{an integral part of the}} ethnographic Lithuania, while to the Poles, because of its large Polish population, it was a Polish city. Poland's Chief of State Józef Piłsudski sought a union with Lithuania in hopes of reviving the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Międzymorze federation). The Lithuanians believed <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their sovereignty under the proposed federation and wanted their own national state. Although Polish–Lithuanian relations were not immediately hostile, they grew worse as each side refused to compromise.|$|E
5|$|Teams only {{averaged}} around 80 {{points per}} game {{in the years following}} the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946. Before the introduction of the shot clock, teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans irritable. Starting in the 1954–55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the allotted time, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> possession. This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games. All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot-clock era.|$|E
5|$|The Midshipmen's win was {{the first}} in school history, and {{continued}} the team's shutout streak. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> their only game in the 1883 season, ending the consecutive shutouts, and the Naval Academy would not get another shutout until the 1886 season, when they defeated Johns Hopkins 6–0. The 1882 season also marked the start of an eight-season long rivalry with Johns Hopkins, which Navy would win, five games to four. The team would not have another coach until the 1892 season, when Ben Crosby was hired to lead. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2. The squad would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3.|$|E
50|$|At the year's end, River {{played the}} 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, beating Sanfrecce Hiroshima 1-0 in the semi-finals {{with a goal}} from Lucas Alario. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> later <b>lose</b> the final against European champions Fútbol Club Barcelona by 3-0, with goals from Messi and Suárez (x2).|$|R
50|$|Sams {{suffered}} {{a broken leg}} against the Cincinnati Bengals and missed the remainder of Baltimore's 2007 season. Before suffering the injury, he helped keep the team in the game with 177 return yards, though <b>they</b> <b>would</b> ultimately <b>lose</b> on a late flag that negated a Todd Heap touchdown.|$|R
5000|$|Mücke Motorsport {{were given}} a four-race ban due to a {{force-deflection}} test that revealed that each {{oil pressure relief valve}} spring was of a different characteristic than the standard spring installed in the engine.

5|$|The homeless, {{who were}} by {{majority}} South and Central American males, {{said that they}} came into the area from their respective countries in promise of work. A particular individual who was interviewed said that the work he was told about had only been short term and, along {{with many of the}} others, had nowhere else to go. Most who had been approached about relocation into nearby homeless shelters express their hesitation to leave the Grove Church Cemetery grounds, fearful that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the freedom they had on the public property. Measures were taken to remove and clean up the cemetery, and it is believed that while some may have entered into shelters, others likely still reside in the general area, while some had moved into the wooded eastern side of the Palisades hills in Union City, where many shacks can be seen supporting the homeless.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Pistons {{won their}} first playoff series since 1991. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> in the Eastern Conference Semifinals to the Celtics in five games.|$|E

25|$|The Cowboys {{would go}} one better in 2005, {{when they reached}} their first grand final in club history. With the help of new {{recruits}} Carl Webb and Johnathan Thurston, the side finished in 5th spot and with back-to-back finals appearances. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> ultimately <b>lose</b> the grand final to the Wests Tigers.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the first}} round of the 2017 playoffs, the Blue Jackets were placed in a matchup against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
