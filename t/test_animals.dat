5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory <b>test</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in <b>test</b> <b>animals,</b> but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
25|$|Also paeoniflorin {{seems to}} have a detoxifying effect on the acute {{toxicity}} of aconitine in <b>test</b> <b>animals.</b> This may result from alternations of pharmacokinetic behavior of aconitine in the animals due to the pharmacokinetic interaction between aconitine and paeoniflorin. In addition, in emergencies, one can wash the stomach using either tannic acid or powdered charcoal. Heart stimulants such as strong coffee or caffeine may also help until professional help is available.|$|E

25|$|The Voskhod was {{designed}} as an incremental improvement on the Vostok to meet Khruschev's goal. One of the difficulties {{in the design of}} the Voskhod was the need to land it via parachute. The three-person crew could not bail out and land by parachute, since the altitude would not be survivable. So the craft would need much larger parachutes in order to land safely. Early tests with the craft resulted in some failures causing the death of <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> until use of stronger fabric improved parachute reliability.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} the toxins of Ixodes holocyclus cause {{a failure of}} {{secretion}} of neurotransmitter acetylcholine at neuro-muscular junctions. In experiments where nerve-muscle preparations were incubated in solution containing toxin the paralysis effect was delayed for six to seven hours after the addition of toxin. As in live <b>test</b> <b>animals,</b> this effect was temperature dependent, paralysis being more rapid at higher temperatures. Live mice injected with toxin did not develop signs of paralysis for some 8 to 12 hours after the injection. The cause of the delayed toxicity is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{autoclave}} treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial spores {{in addition}} to fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but {{is not expected to}} eliminate all prions, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state 121-132°C for 60 minutes or 134°C for at least 18 minutes. The 263K scrapie prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of CJD and BSE are more resistant. Using mice as <b>test</b> <b>animals,</b> one experiment showed that heating BSE positive brain tissue at 134-138°C for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 log decrease in prion infectivity.|$|E
50|$|The median infective dose (ID50) is {{the number}} of organisms {{received}} by a person or <b>test</b> <b>animal</b> qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral).

25|$|After the {{deprivation}} is complete, mild psychological disturbances, such as anxiety, irritability, hallucinations, {{and difficulty}} concentrating may develop and appetite may increase. There are also positive consequences of REM deprivation. Some {{symptoms of depression}} {{are found to be}} suppressed by REM deprivation; aggression, and eating behavior may increase. Higher norepinepherine is a possible cause of these results. Whether and how long-term REM deprivation has psychological effects remains a matter of controversy. Several reports have indicated that REM deprivation increases aggression and sexual behavior in laboratory <b>test</b> <b>animals.</b> Rats deprived of paradoxical sleep die in 4–6 weeks (twice the time before death in case of total sleep deprivation). Mean body temperature falls continually during this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} sit upright was an {{important}} requirement for <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> in order that another common fatal injury among human victims, decapitation, could be studied. Additionally, {{it was important for}} researchers to be able to determine to what extent cabin design needed to be modified to ensure optimal survival circumstances. For instance, a dashboard with too little padding or padding which was too stiff or too soft would not significantly reduce head injury over a dash with no padding at all. While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash. Rear-view mirror impact is a significant occurrence in a frontal collision; how should a mirror be built so that it is both rigid enough to perform its task and yet of low injury risk if struck.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 {{pet food}} recalls {{comprise}} the contamination and wide recall of many brands of {{cat and dog}} foods beginning in March 2007, and the ensuing developments involving the human food supply. The recalls in North America, Europe, and South Africa came in response to reports of renal failure in pets. Initially, the recalls {{were associated with the}} consumption of mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on 16 March 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the <b>test</b> <b>animals.</b> Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure. In the following weeks, several other companies who received the contaminated wheat gluten also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. One month after the initial recall, contaminated rice protein from a different source in China was also identified as being associated with kidney failure in pets in the United States, while contaminated corn gluten was associated with kidney failure with pets in South Africa. As a result of investigating the 2007 pet food recalls, a broader Chinese protein export contamination investigation unfolded, raising concerns about the safety of the human food supply.|$|E
25|$|Brenda, still {{distressed by}} the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, {{the only person in the}} group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.|$|E
500|$|Only {{pigs and}} rats {{were used in}} the Baker test. [...] All the pigs and most of the rats died. Several days elapsed before sailors were able to reboard the target ships where <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> were located; during that time the {{accumulated}} doses from the gamma rays produced by fission products became lethal for the animals. Since much of the public interest in Operation Crossroads had focused on the fate of the <b>test</b> <b>animals,</b> in September Blandy asserted that radiation death is not painful: [...] "The animal merely languishes and recovers or dies a painless death. Suffering among the animals as a whole was negligible." [...] This was clearly not true. While the well-documented suffering of Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin as they died of radiation injury at Los Alamos was still secret, the widely reported radiation deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki had not been painless.

2500|$|Cysteine {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a preventative or antidote {{for some of the}} negative effects of alcohol, including liver damage and hangover.

2500|$|The {{hepatotoxicity}} of {{vinyl chloride}} {{has long been}} established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its infant stages. In the very first study {{about the dangers of}} vinyl chloride, published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> to just a single short-term high dose of vinyl chloride caused liver damage. In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that vinyl chloride caused liver injury among workers. In 1954, B.F. Goodrich Chemical stated that vinyl chloride caused liver injury upon short-term exposures. [...] Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects. They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies. The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made. In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm). Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in vinyl chloride workers. In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in vinyl chloride workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans. In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P. L. Viola, a European researcher working for the European vinyl chloride industry, indicated, [...] "every monomer used in V.C. manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver. Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes. The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures." [...] In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of vinyl chloride exposure, Viola added that he [...] "should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing vinyl chloride, such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer …" [...] In 1970, Viola, reported that <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> exposed to 30,000 ppm of vinyl chloride developed cancerous tumors. Viola began his research looking for the cause of liver and bone injuries found in vinyl chloride workers. Viola's findings in 1970 were a [...] "red flag" [...] to B.F. Goodrich and the industry. In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European vinyl chloride industry, found liver tumors (including angiosarcoma) from vinyl chloride exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1921, Banting {{traveled}} to Toronto to explain his idea to J.J.R. Macleod, Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto, and asked Macleod if he could use his lab space to test the idea. Initially skeptical, Macleod eventually agreed and supplied Banting with ten <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> (dogs) and two medical students, Charles Best and Clark Noble, as lab assistants. Since Banting required only one lab assistant, Best and Noble flipped a coin to see which would assist Banting {{for the first half}} of the summer. Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This may have proved unfortunate for Noble, Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and a large part of the credit for the discovery. Banting's method was to tie a ligature around the pancreatic duct; when examined several weeks later, the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system, leaving thousands of islets. They then isolated an extract from these islets, producing what they called [...] "isletin" [...] (what we now know as insulin), and tested this extract on the dogs starting July 27. Banting and Best were then able to keep a pancreatectomized dog named Marjorie alive for the rest of the summer by injecting her with the crude extract they had prepared. Removal of the pancreas in <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> in essence mimics diabetes, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Marjorie was able to remain alive because the extracts, containing isletin, were able to lower her blood glucose levels.|$|E
