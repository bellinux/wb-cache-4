5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line,</b> maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line</b> in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 Long unsuccessfully {{challenged}} the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice {{announced his retirement}} the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler's return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot's avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post's relative unimportance. He was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, {{despite a lack of}} support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line,</b> but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008 Presidential Election, <b>the</b> Independence <b>Party</b> {{endorsed}} John McCain for President and Sarah Palin for Vice President. They received 163,973 {{votes on}} <b>the</b> Independence <b>Party</b> <b>line,</b> compared to 170,475 on <b>the</b> Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>line</b> and 2,418,323 on <b>the</b> Republican <b>Party</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lincoln {{ran for the}} Whig {{nomination}} for Illinois's 7th district of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1843, but was defeated by John J. Hardin. However, Lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby Hardin would retire after only one term {{to allow for the}} nomination of another candidate. Lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. Lincoln was indeed elected to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line.</b> Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.|$|E
5|$|The LCL had governed, {{primarily}} {{under the}} stead of Sir Thomas Playford, for 32 years, and finally lost to Labor in 1965. A {{year and a}} half later, when Playford retired, Steele Hall was elected to replace him. A young farmer from a rural constituency, Hall had never conflicted with <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line,</b> and was expected to uphold the existing LCL principles, having spoken out in support of the Playmander and the restrictive Legislative Council before. However, when the LCL was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership, with the help of malapportionment, Hall was under pressure. Labor had led the LCL 52.0 to 43.8% on primary votes, but owing to the Playmander, both ended with 19 seats and an independent supported the LCL and returned them to power. Large protests against the Playmander broke out, and there were strong calls for reform.|$|E
5|$|There {{were rumors}} that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, {{intended}} to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, {{as head of}} the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton's lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, so it can be concluded that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks' attempt to contest the election, which was published in the Little Rock Republican on October 8, 1873 and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints {{from the likes of}} Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line,</b> Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E
5|$|The unified {{armed forces}} of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the Wehrmacht. This {{included}} the Heer (army), Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force). From 2 August 1934, members {{of the armed forces}} were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally. In contrast to the previous oath, which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments, this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal. Hitler decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen—the mobile death squads responsible for millions of deaths in Eastern Europe—when it was tactically possible to do so. Members of the Wehrmacht also participated directly in the Holocaust by shooting civilians or undertaking genocide under the guise of anti-partisan operations. <b>The</b> <b>party</b> <b>line</b> was that the Jews were the instigators of the partisan struggle and therefore needed to be eliminated. On 8 July 1941, Heydrich announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot.|$|E

25|$|Under the Soviet rule, {{particularly}} during Joseph Stalin's reign, Azeri writers {{who did not}} conform to <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line</b> were persecuted.

25|$|Foreign {{observers}} {{have attempted to}} explain the Party’s rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming {{from a variety of}} factors. These include Falun Gong’s popularity, its independence from the state and refusal to toe <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> <b>line,</b> internal power politics within the Communist Party, and Falun Gong’s moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with the Party's Marxist–Leninist atheist ideology.|$|E

25|$|This {{check on}} the {{executive}} branch, however, is a weak one. Since Cabinet ministers are often {{the leaders of the}} majority party in Parliament, they may enforce party discipline and loyalty through the party whip such that MPs from that party conform to <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line.</b> This means that a majority of Parliament will be less inclined, if at all, to oppose or challenge the executive's decisions.|$|E
25|$|Although a Religious Zionist, Bakshi-Doron was {{not afraid}} to buck <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>line.</b> In 2000, while visiting the Jewish {{community}} in Singapore, Bakshi-Doron declared {{that he was in}} favor of giving away parts of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as a way towards ending the Arab-Israeli Conflict. He stipulated that any agreement would have to allow for the Temple Mount to remain in Israeli hands.|$|E
25|$|Wang {{is often}} seen as a leading liberal in China's ruling elite, {{representing}} a school of thought that advocates for a greater role of the free market, gradual political liberalization, and a government that is {{more in touch with}} the needs of ordinary people.

25|$|Dion's wife Janine Krieber {{also drew}} some {{controversy}} in the 2008 campaign. She complained {{that she was being}} muzzled by the Liberals, though party officials denied it.
