5|$|In January 2012 Cricket Ireland chief {{executive}} Warren Deutrom publicly declared Ireland's ambition to play Test cricket by 2020. Their desire to achieve Test status {{was in part}} <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Irish players using residency rules to switch to England {{for the opportunity to}} play Test cricket. Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E
5|$|In {{diplomatic}} {{talks with}} the Ho-Chunks {{at the close of}} the war, General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region. Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were trespassing on Ho-Chunk land, but after the war, settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers, and U.S. officials proved to be unable or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> By January 1828, there were as many as 10,000 illegal settlers on Ho-Chunk land, including militia general Henry Dodge, who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave. Having no other options, on August 25, 1828, the Ho-Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States, agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in a more formal treaty to be held later.|$|E

50|$|Following his apprehension, Breivik was characterised by analysts {{as being}} a right-wing extremist with anti-Muslim views and a {{deep-seated}} hatred of Islam, who considered himself a knight dedicated <b>to</b> <b>stemming</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Muslim immigration into Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Breivik {{is linked}} to a 1,518-page {{compendium}} entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence bearing the name [...] "Andrew Berwick". The file was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses about 90 minutes before the bomb blast in Oslo. Analysts described him as having Islamophobic views and a hatred of Islam, and as someone who considered himself as a knight dedicated <b>to</b> <b>stemming</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Muslim immigration into Europe.|$|R
5|$|The Great Depression {{provided}} a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 {{resulted in the}} break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and {{paved the way for}} authoritarian forms of government. The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 percent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|In early 1918, the {{collapse}} of Tsarist Russia enabled the Germans to transfer {{a significant number of}} troops to the Western Front and in March, having amassed 192 divisions, they launched an offensive against the British forces in the Somme. Heavily outnumbered, the British and Dominion troops were pushed back by the initial onslaught and the Australian Corps was thrown into the line in an effort <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> The 15th Battalion was moved initially to Bavincourt before securing Hebuterne late in the month, where they experienced a heavy artillery bombardment before turning back a German attack. Later, after being relieved by a battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, they moved to Rossignol Farm. Throughout April, while the 13th and 15th Brigades fought significant actions around Villers-Bretonneux, the battalion received several drafts of reinforcements, bringing it up to a total of 57 officers and 955 other ranks as it prepared to move up to replace the 15th Brigade in late April. Following their arrival, they undertook a support role, constructing defences before moving on to Freschencourt on 22 May, remaining there until they marched {{at the end of the}} month to Hamelet near Corbie, where they conducted several patrol actions.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next five months, the 39th Battalion rotated between the front line and rear areas, holding the line in Belgium {{throughout}} winter. In the spring of 1918, when the German Army launched its last effort at victory, known as the Spring Offensive, the 39th was among the many Australian battalions that were hurriedly moved south to France in order <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of the German onslaught towards Amiens; fighting a series of defensive actions in the Somme between late March and early June. When the Allies launched their own offensive—the Hundred Days Offensive—on 8 August 1918, the battalion along with the rest of the 10th Brigade, was serving as the divisional reserve and they did not participate in the advance that has since become known as one of the greatest days for the Allies on the Western Front. On 10 August, the battalion was committed to battle once more, undertaking an attack on the village of Proyart, but this attack was ill-conceived and ultimately failed. Despite this, the battalion remained in the line throughout August and early September as the 3rd Division advanced through the Somme Valley.|$|E
50|$|These {{were desperate}} {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> radical <b>tide</b> of <b>the</b> government of Gualberto Villarroel López. On 21 July 1946, students and workers overthrew {{the government and}} Gualberto Villarroel was killed.|$|R
25|$|On {{becoming}} {{head of the}} government, Botha {{retained the}} defence portfolio until October 1980, when he appointed chief of the South African Defence Force, General Magnus Malan, his successor. From his ascension to the cabinet, Botha pursued an ambitious military policy designed to increase South Africa's military capability. He sought to improve relations with the West – especially the United States – but with mixed results. He argued that {{the preservation of the}} apartheid government, though unpopular, was crucial <b>to</b> <b>stemming</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of African Communism, which had made in-roads into neighbouring Angola and Mozambique after these two former Portuguese colonies obtained independence.|$|R

5|$|In early 1918, {{after the}} {{capitulation}} of Tsarist Russia the Germans, having moved {{the bulk of}} their forces to the Western Front, launched the Spring Offensive, striking against the British forces in the Somme. The initial onslaught pushed the Allied forces back and the Australian divisions, which had been merged into the Australian Corps, were thrown into the line in an effort <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> In early March, the 11th Battalion moved to the Hollebeke sector, where they were subjected to gas attacks before being sent south to Amiens at the start of April, joining the rest of the 1st Division in defence of Hazebrouck {{in the middle of the}} month. For the next couple of months the battalion rotated through the line in a defensive role as the German offensive was blunted. In June, as the Allies sought to regain some of the initiative, they undertook a series of Peaceful Penetration raids. On 2 June, the 11th Battalion attacked Mont de Merris, which resulted in the capture of a large amount of German equipment and over 200 prisoners for the loss of 16 men killed and 74 wounded. A lesser attack was launched on the German trenches opposite the battalion on 22 June. Around this time, a small group of US soldiers was attached to the 11th Battalion to gain experience. The following month, the battalion captured Gerbedoen Farm before supporting the 10th Battalion's successful attack on Merris.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{regional}} and international expressions and efforts, such as by the UN and EU, have attempted <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of war. Other efforts, such as by the ICRC, seek to alleviate the humanitarian suffering and ameliorate the crisis caused by the conflict.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the attack}} on the Khyber, {{secondary}} attacks had been planned on Quetta and Kurram, and in the north in Chitral state and in the south in Baluchistan and the Zhob Valley. On 23 May the British posts around the Kurram Valley had to be abandoned. The following day Handley Page bombers attacked Kabul; however, it did little <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> and the supply situation in Landi Kotal grew worse.|$|E
50|$|During {{the second}} half the 5th century BC the Romans and the Latins appears <b>to</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Volscian aggression.

50|$|While the Parimala {{follows the}} advaitic approach, Dikshitar has written another {{commentary}} Sivaarka-mani-deepika on the Brahmasutras. But this is written {{from the point}} of view of Siva-visishtadvaita.. These two works - Sivaarka-mani-deepika and Parimala - are his magnum opus both in bulk and importance. Though both are commentaries on the Brahma sutra, Parimala aligns itself to the advaitic interpretation while the other work expounds the Sivadvaita philosophy of Srikanta Shivacharya. Dikshitar's patron, King Chinna Bomma Nayak of Vellore made endowments for the maintenance of a college of 500 scholars who studied Sivaarka maniDipika under Sri Dikshitar himself, thus equipping themselves for the Saivite propaganda work, which had been organised with a view <b>to</b> <b>stemming</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Vaishnavite attacks and encroachments.|$|R

25|$|J. P. Ricciardi, then {{director}} of player development under Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, {{was named the}} Blue Jays' General Manager and was expected to slash the payroll immediately, <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of red ink. During the off-season, the team traded or let go several popular players, including Alex Gonzalez, Paul Quantrill, Brad Fullmer and closer Billy Koch to let talented youngsters such as Eric Hinske and Felipe López {{get a chance to}} develop into major leaguers.|$|E
25|$|The Pigtail Ordinance was {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to the overcrowding of jails due to the 1870 Sanitary Ordinance, which was originally meant to prevent unsafe tenement conditions in San Francisco. When in violation of the Sanitary Ordinance, one could either pay a fine or serve a week or more in jail; for thousands of impoverished Chinese immigrants, free room and board was a welcome punishment. Ostensibly to prevent outbreaks of lice and fleas, the Supervisors began requiring that all prisoners' heads be shaved. Many equal rights advocates, however, claimed the Supervisors' true intent was <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of willing Chinese convicts.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1989, revolts {{had spread}} from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b> Gorbachev's {{abrogation}} of the Brezhnev Doctrine was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable {{in the face of}} popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of secret police.|$|E
30|$|We hope Brooks (2015) {{is correct}} in saying, “On almost every campus faculty members and administrators are trying <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> careerist <b>tide</b> and <b>to</b> widen the system’s narrow {{definition}} of achievement. Institutes are popping up — with interdisciplinary humanities programs and even meditation centers — designed to cultivate the whole student.” Carlile et al. (2016) offer encouraging examples.|$|R
50|$|In summer 663, Tibet {{launched}} a major {{attack against the}} Tang vassal Tuyuhun. Emperor Gaozong sent Su to lead an army to aid Tuyuhun, but while there was no further record {{at that time of}} the Tibetans being victorious over Tuyuhun, there were also no records that Su was able <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan <b>tide.</b> He died in 667.|$|R
50|$|In between {{theoretical}} writings, Orobón {{was deeply}} involved in efforts to form a revolutionary alliance <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> rising <b>tide</b> of Fascism and to prepare the way towards revolution.

25|$|Hancock's assault {{started at}} 4:35a.m. on May 12 and easily crashed through the Confederate works. Despite the initial success at obliterating {{much of the}} Mule Shoe salient, there was a flaw in the Union plan—no one had {{considered}} how {{to capitalize on the}} breakthrough. The 15,000 infantrymen of Hancock's II Corps had crowded into a narrow front about a half mile wide and soon lost all unit cohesion, becoming little more than an armed mob. Following the initial shock, the Confederate leadership at all levels began to react well to the Union onslaught and reinforcements were rushed in <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1844, {{two-thirds of}} Episcopal clergy were evangelical. Nevertheless, the growing {{influence}} of the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement on Episcopal Church leaders worried evangelicals. They experienced a loss {{of confidence in the}} church's institutions after 1844 when the church's General Convention refused to label the Oxford Movement a heresy. Their own attempts <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> through heresy trials ultimately failed as well. In response, evangelicals chose to form their own distinctly evangelical Episcopal voluntary societies to promote education and evangelism, such as the Protestant Episcopal Society for the Promotion of Evangelical Knowledge (which later merged with what is now known as the Episcopal Evangelism Society) and the American Church Missionary Society (which was modelled on the English society).|$|E
25|$|In Pax Britannica, Voigt set out {{his views}} {{as to how}} the post-war world should be ordered, placing {{particular}} emphasis on the role that Britain should play in the new world order. He argued that the continuance of British imperial power was essential <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Communist revolution and maintain peace and stability in what was termed the Third World. Furthermore, he believed a strong Britain and a rehabilitated Germany were essential to prevent Soviet expansion in Europe, and that British foreign policy should have three main principles: the maintenance of {{the balance of power in}} Europe, ensuring the independence of all her neighbours and “armed strength, and readiness, upon just cause, to fight”.|$|E
50|$|Though the Edict {{went so far}} as {{to forbid}} the {{discussion}} of religious topics at work, in the fields, or over meals, it proved insufficient <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> rising <b>tide</b> of reform in religion. Sterner measures would be taken in the next edict of the series, the Edict of Compiègne, 1557, which applied the death penalty for all convictions of heresy.|$|R

[...] More to blame, he said, was the failure of governments and religious leaderships {{to face up to the}} practices that facilitated the spread of HIV.|$|R
50|$|Abū Yūsuf Ya‘qūb al-Manṣūr (ابو يوسف يعقوب المنصور) (c. 1160 Morocco - 23 January 1199 Marrakesh, Morocco), {{also known}} as Moulay Yacoub, was the third Almohad Caliph. Succeeding his father, al-Mansur reigned from 1184 to 1199. His reign was {{distinguished}} by the flourishing of trade, architecture, philosophy and the sciences, {{as well as by}} victorious military campaigns in which he was able <b>to</b> temporarily <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of Christian Reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula.|$|R
25|$|A {{major change}} was the {{introduction}} of television in 1956. The Labor Party had, in June 1949, pledged to introduce television into Australia as soon as possible, but it had lost office later that year, and the Liberal Menzies government was opposed to television, which Menzies hoped would never come to Australia. Nonetheless, he was unable <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of public opinion, and the Broadcasting and Television Act (1956) allowed for television in Australia {{just in time for}} the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. The addition of television caused a spurt of growth at the ABC, as staff numbers grew from 2,000 in 1956 to 3,000 in 1960, while the budget doubled from ₤3.7 million to ₤7.4 million.|$|E
25|$|The British force, {{numbering}} initially {{over forty}} five hundred men, was easily able to outmaneuver the Nepalese army defenders and {{force them to}} abandon one post after another. Despite a significant victory over Captain Hearsey’s force, which had been sent on a flanking movement though Eastern Kumaun, and the capture of the captain himself, the Nepalese army was unable <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of the British advance. Hasti Dal Shah arrived in Almora with a small body of reinforcement troops. A further reinforcement of four companies was sent from Kathmandu to aid the beleaguered defences of Kumaun, but the difficulties of communication through the hills prevented them from arriving in time to be of any help.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Ruairi's death in 1198, King Henry II of England had invaded Ireland and given the part of it he {{controlled}} to his son John as a Lordship when John was just 10 in 1177. When John succeeded to the English throne in 1199, he remained Lord of Ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland into personal union. By the mid-13th century, while the island was nominally ruled by the king of England, from c.1260 the effective area of control began to recede. As various Cambro-Norman noble families died out in the male line, the Gaelic nobility began to reclaim lost territory. Successive English kings did little <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide,</b> instead using Ireland to draw upon men and supplies in the wars in Scotland and France.|$|E
50|$|The government's ambitious {{plans to}} {{increase}} {{the standard of living}} in rural areas fell short of their objectives. Limited investment in social capital, despite the various land development schemes, had failed <b>to</b> either <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> of rural-urban migration or raise the incomes of rural families. In West Malaysia, 90% of all households earning less than M$100 a month were located in rural areas. The vast majority of these were Malay households.|$|R
50|$|Philip II of Spain, {{reacting}} to the Protestant Reformation sweeping through Europe during the 16th century, devoted much of his lengthy reign (1556-1598) and much of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of New World gold <b>to</b> <b>stemming</b> <b>the</b> Protestant <b>tide.</b> His protracted efforts were, in the long run, partly successful; however, the same counter-reformational impulse had a much more benign expression thirty years earlier in Philip's decision to build the complex at El Escorial.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} Japanese {{attacked}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 (8 December {{west of the}} date line), Parrott and her sister ships joined the American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) effort <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>the</b> Japanese <b>tide</b> sweeping down from the north. Parrott operated in the Netherlands East Indies archipelago until the fall of Java, participating in two major engagements—the Battle of Makassar Strait (24 January 1942) and the Battle of Badoeng Strait (20 February 1942).|$|R
