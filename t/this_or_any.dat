5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> sum, point blank, and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E

25|$|So Kock went {{directly}} to President Lincoln. Lincoln had his doubts about Kock's sincerity at first. He suspected that Kock was only after the $50 per person which had been promised. Kock managed to convince him, however, and on December 31, the President promised that he would think about his plan. But just one day later, on January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which contained not a single word about <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other colonial plan.|$|E
25|$|Catholics {{say that}} Santa Muerte is an idol, {{the worship of}} which has been {{rejected}} by God in the Old Testament. Veneration of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other idol can be a form of inadvertent devil-worship, because regardless of the intent of the worshipers; the devil can trick people into doing such things. Priests regularly chastise parishioners, telling them that death is not a person but rather a phase of life. However, the Church stops short of labeling such followers as heretics, instead accusing them of heterodoxy.|$|E
25|$|We {{have too}} many Jews in the towns. They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade.

I have never persecuted anyone from <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} noted here that the {{erection}} of episcopal conferences was as yet by no means obligatory. This, then, was a freely agreed-upon instrument of mutual help and cooperation. And as such it was in advance of most European Conferences, which were only established {{in connection with the}} Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Rome, though praising the Scandinavian initiative by sending a high-level congratulatory telegram, did not formally recognise <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> of the existing conferences. Nor did the Holy See as yet use them as consultative bodies, but all this was to come. The necessities arising from Vatican II brought about the change.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{excavations}} of {{ruins of}} Hindu temples, {{such as the}} 14th century Malinithan {{at the foot of}} the Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the Chutiya reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar, has led to suggestions that the Idu (Mishmi) had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. Again, however, no evidence directly associates Bhismaknagar with <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other known culture but the Chutiya rulers held the areas around Bhismaknagar from the 12th to 16th century. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso was born in Tawang.|$|E
25|$|The ABO {{blood group}} system {{is used to}} denote the {{presence}} of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes. In human blood transfusions {{it is the most}} important of the 35 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized. A very rare (in modern medicine) mismatch in <b>this,</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other serotype, can cause a serious, potentially fatal, adverse reaction after a transfusion, or a contra-indicated immune response to a organ transplant. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, which are produced {{in the first years of}} life by sensitization to environmental substances, such as food, bacteria, and viruses. ABO blood types are also present in some other animals, for example rodents and apes, such as chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas.|$|E

25|$|Captioning is {{modulated}} {{and stored}} differently in PAL and SECAM 625 line 25 frame countries, where teletext is used {{rather than in}} EIA-608, but the methods of preparation and the line 21 field used are similar. For home Betamax and VHS videotapes, a shift down of this line 21 field must be done due to the greater number of VBI lines used in 625 line PAL countries, though only {{a small minority of}} European PAL VHS machines support <b>this</b> (<b>or</b> <b>any)</b> format for closed caption recording. Like all teletext fields, teletext captions can't be stored by a standard 625 line VHS recorder (due to the lack of field shifting support); they are available on all professional S-VHS recordings due to all fields being recorded. Recorded Teletext caption fields also suffer from a higher number of caption errors due to increased number of bits and a low SNR, especially on low-bandwidth VHS. This is why Teletext captions used to be stored separately on floppy disk to the analogue master tape. DVDs have their own system for subtitles and/or captions that is digitally inserted in the data stream and encoded on playback in video field lines.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in their construction, microphones have their own characteristic responses to sound. This difference in response produces non-uniform phase and frequency responses. In addition, microphones are not uniformly sensitive to sound pressure, and can accept differing levels without distorting. Although for scientific applications microphones with a more uniform response are desirable, this is often {{not the case for}} music recording, as the non-uniform response of a microphone can produce a desirable coloration of the sound. There is an international standard for microphone specifications, but few manufacturers adhere to it. As a result, comparison of published data from different manufacturers is difficult because different measurement techniques are used. The Microphone Data Website has collated the technical specifications complete with pictures, response curves and technical data from the microphone manufacturers for every currently listed microphone, and even a few obsolete models, and shows the data for them all in one common format for ease of comparison.. Caution should be used in drawing any solid conclusions from <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other published data, however, unless it is known that the manufacturer has supplied specifications in accordance with IEC60268-4.|$|E
25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>any</b> other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E
