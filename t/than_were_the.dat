5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the AFL {{was doing}} a better job of {{expanding}} into the fast-growing white collar sector, with its organizations of clerks, public employees, teachers, and service workers. Although the AFL building trades maintained all-white policies, the AFL had more black members in all as the CIO. The problem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO's industrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> AFL's trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions. But Meany had a strong record in fighting corruption in New York unions, and was highly critical of the notoriously corrupt Teamsters.|$|E
25|$|It {{was settled}} by the Romans earlier <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> current centers of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. These colonists {{constructed}} a ford through the river, shortly past {{the confluence of}} the three rivers, for their military highway. Due to this strategic location, Pforzheim later became a center for the timber-rafting trade, which transported timber from the Black Forest via the rivers Wuerm, Nagold, Enz and down the Neckar and Rhine to, among other markets, the Netherlands for use in shipbuilding. There timbers were also used to construct the foundations for Amsterdam, which was built in a swamp.|$|E

After visiting East Berlin during the annual May Day celebration, she felt that the East German government was dealing better with the residual effects of fascism <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> West Germans. Many of her roommates were active in the radical Socialist German Student Union (SDS), and Davis participated in some SDS actions. Events in the United States, including the formation of the Black Panther Party and the transformation of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to an all-black organization, made her ready to return there.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained {{a higher level of}} education than their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they had}} {{acquired}} some immunity in their homeland, Africans were {{more resistant to}} these tropical fevers <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Europeans. As the rice industry was developed, planters continued to import African slaves. By about 1708, South Carolina had a black majority. Coastal Georgia developed a black majority after rice cultivation expanded there in the mid-18th century. Malaria and yellow fever became endemic. Fearing these diseases, many white planters and their families left the Lowcountry during the rainy spring and summer months when fevers ran rampant. Others lived mostly {{in cities such as}} Charleston rather than on the isolated plantations, especially those on the Sea Islands.|$|E

25|$|The {{interiors}} of the Tudor style building have evolved considerably {{along with the}} style, often becoming truer to the replicated era <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> first examples of the revival style. At Ascott House, Devey's great masterpiece constructed throughout {{the last twenty years}} of the 19th century, the only internal concessions to the Tudor age are the low ceilings necessitated through the external Tudor theme. There are certainly no beam ceilings, low narrow doorways or inglenook fireplaces heating small rooms: the large airy rooms are in fact more redolent of the 18th century than the 16th. Cragside is slightly more true to its theme, although the rooms are very large, some contain Tudor style panelling, and the dining room contains are monumental inglenook, but this is more in the style of Italian renaissance meets Camelot than Tudor. While in the cottages at Mentmore the interiors are no different from those of any lower middle-class Victorian small household.|$|E
500|$|Financial {{problems}} compounded the VNQDD's difficulties. Money {{was needed}} {{to set up a}} commercial enterprise, a cover for the revolutionaries to meet and plot, and for raising funds. For this purpose, a hotel-restaurant named the Vietnam Hotel was opened in September 1928. The French colonial authorities were aware of the real purpose of the business, and put it under surveillance without taking further preliminary action. The first notable reorganisation of the VNQDD was in December, when Nguyen Khac Nhu replaced Hoc as chairman. Three proto-governmental organs were created, to form the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government. The records of the French secret service estimated that by early 1929, the VNQDD consisted of approximately 1,500 members in 120 cells, mostly in areas around the Red River Delta. The intelligence reported that most members were students, minor merchants or low-level bureaucrats in the French administration. The report stated that there were landlords and wealthy peasants among the members, but that few were of scholar-gentry (mandarin) rank. According to the historian Cecil B. Currey, [...] "The VNQDD's lower-class origins made it, in many ways, closer to the labouring poor <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Communists, many of whom… from established middle-class families." ...|$|E
500|$|Westerners {{were more}} {{enthusiastic}} toward the game <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Japanese, {{although there were}} a few negative appraisals. [...] GamePro magazine opined Alisia Dragoons responsive controls, coupled with the hectic action and handsome graphics, made the game highly desirable for owners of the Genesis console. The Lessers of Dragon magazine were equally impressed with the gameplay, praising Alisia Dragoon for its [...] "solid arcade action" [...] that satisfied their [...] "need for fast reflexes". Mean Machiness Julian Rignall praised the game for its pet monsters design, calling the management of the pets in the game an encouragement toward tactics. His fellow reviewer, Richard Leadbetter, wrote the game was visually attractive with [...] "beautiful sprites" [...] and [...] "amazing backdrops". He found the gameplay challenging, being forced to conserve energy as the game [...] " [...] everything but the kitchen sink at [...] ". Rignall agreed with Leadbetter on the game's difficulty, which along with the secret rooms and power-ups to be discovered made Alisia Dragoon an excellent action platform game that had long-lasting appeal. [...] Of the hundreds of Genesis games, Mega magazine rated Alisia Dragoon among the top 100 games, calling it [...] " [...] the best dragon-based platform game around." [...] Despite the positive sentiments, sales of the game outside Japan were weak.|$|E

2500|$|Conrad had insulted Manuel {{by calling}} him [...] "King of the Greeks" [...] {{rather than his}} formal title of [...] "Emperor of the Romans", and the {{imperial}} pretensions of the Germans made them far more suspect in Byzantine eyes <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> French. Following oaths taken by the German leaders that they intended no injury to the Byzantine Empire, Manuel made preparations for markets to be made available as the crusader army crossed imperial territory. A Byzantine force under the experienced general Prosouch (Borsuq), who was of Turkish origin, shadowed the Germans. A minor clash between the Byzantine force and the crusaders occurred near Adrianople, with the Byzantines repulsing an attack by Conrad's nephew, the future emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The crusaders also suffered a natural disaster, when part of their encampment was swept away by a flash flood with considerable loss of life.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Reynald Secher {{argued that}} {{the actions of the}} French republican {{government}} during the revolt in the Vendée (1793–1796), a popular mostly Catholic uprising against the anti-clerical Republican government during the French Revolution was the first modern genocide. Secher's claims caused a minor uproar in France and mainstream authorities rejected Secher's claims. Timothy Tackett countered that [...] "the Vendée was a tragic civil war with endless horrors committed by both sides—initiated, in fact, by the rebels themselves. The Vendeans were no more blameless <b>than</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> republicans. The use of the word genocide is wholly inaccurate and inappropriate." [...] However, historians Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn consider the Vendée a case of genocide. Historian Pierre Chaunu called the Vendée the first ideological genocide. Adam Jones estimates that 150,000 Vendeans died in what he also considers a genocide.|$|E
