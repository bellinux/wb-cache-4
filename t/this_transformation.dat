5|$|Darlington {{additionally}} used {{a transformation}} found by Hendrik Bode that predicted {{the response of}} a filter using non-ideal components but all with the same Q. Darlington used <b>this</b> <b>transformation</b> in reverse to produce filters with a prescribed insertion-loss with non-ideal components. Such filters have the ideal insertion-loss response plus a flat attenuation across all frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Overall Set {{was viewed}} with ambivalence, until {{during the first}} {{millennium}} BCE he {{came to be seen}} as a totally malevolent deity. <b>This</b> <b>transformation</b> was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{its long}} history, the {{division}} {{has taken on}} numerous roles. Serving as the 100th Infantry Division until the 1950s, the division then briefly became the 100th Airborne Division before becoming the 100th Division (Training). Since <b>this</b> <b>transformation,</b> the division has primarily taken on numerous training roles for other Army units.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve <b>this</b> <b>transformation,</b> the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} about France {{rose in the}} 1880s and an electrically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. Additional contact mines were added, forcing incoming vessels to sail into a channel alongside St Mawes, illuminated with electric search lights. As part of <b>this</b> <b>transformation,</b> the castle's 64-pounder guns were partially replaced with light, quick-firing guns in the 1890s, able to engage any torpedo boats or mine sweepers attempting {{to break through the}} defences. The batteries for these were found to be poorly sited, and an additional battery was therefore built above the Henrician castle between 1900 and 1901, again for housing quick-firing guns.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but {{in the context of}} a brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized <b>this</b> <b>transformation</b> by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} was inactivated on 15 June 1997 in Germany. Over {{the next}} four months, the unit's inactive components were reorganized and redesignated as a brigade sized unit, allowing it {{to take on a}} larger support staff that could command more soldiers. <b>This</b> <b>transformation</b> occurred as the brigade was reassigned to the continental United States. It was activated on 24 October 1997 as the 166th Aviation Brigade at Fort Riley, Kansas. It was also activated into the Active duty force.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that <b>this</b> <b>transformation</b> represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E

5|$|To expand {{upon the}} concept of Reserve {{component}} and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for reserve units' readiness and mobilization exercises. Division East activated at Fort Riley. <b>This</b> <b>transformation</b> {{was part of an}} overall restructuring of the US Army to streamline the organizations overseeing training. Division East took control of reserve units in states east of the Mississippi River, eliminating the need for the 24th Infantry Division headquarters. As such, the 24th Infantry Division was again inactivated on 1 August 2006 at Fort Riley.|$|E
5|$|New gods {{continued}} to emerge after <b>this</b> <b>transformation.</b> Some important deities like Isis and Amun {{are not known}} to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could suddenly inspire {{the creation of a}} deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings were said to be divine, although only a few {{continued to}} be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials.|$|E
5|$|This {{demand was}} {{far-reaching}} and required {{transformation of the}} empire into a federal state, placing Lithuania {{on a par with}} the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian constitutional system. Heated discussions continued on the means to achieve <b>this</b> <b>transformation.</b> Some argued for armed resistance, but were reminded that the previous uprisings in November 1831 and January 1863 had failed. Others suggested peaceful and passive resistance: refusing to pay taxes, boycotting products from monopolistic companies (mostly those selling alcoholic beverages), not allowing children to attend Russian schools, evading drafts into the Russian army, and organizing factory worker strikes. The delegates, who were mostly small farmers, also discussed land reform, demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it. However, no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage the peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening in other parts of the Russian Empire.|$|E

40|$|The {{aluminium}} induced layer exchange {{process is}} used for growing crystalline Si films on amorphous substrates like glass, which are further epitaxially thickened {{and can be used}} for photovoltaic applications. In this work we investigated Al 2 O 3 membranes separating the Al and Si layer during the layer exchange by means of high resolution transmission electron microscopy and studied the influence of the membranes structure on crystallization of Si. We observed a phase transformation of the membrane from the amorphous state to amp; 947; Al 2 O 3 at exchange temperatures at above 450 C.

5|$|In Cocoon, the {{citizens}} of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse. Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During <b>this</b> <b>transformation,</b> the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok. Arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, the party finds Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of Rule 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros. With <b>this</b> <b>transformation,</b> every six steps of the Rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of the Rule 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of Rule 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{archaeology}} of Iowa is {{the study}} of the buried remains of human culture within the state of Iowa from the earliest prehistoric through the late historic periods. When the American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. <b>This</b> <b>transformation</b> happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500–2,800 years ago) American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on the reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and American Indians in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state.|$|E
40|$|For a {{constant}} membrane potential, a predominantly inhibitory GABAergic synaptic response {{is shown to}} undergo long-term transformation into an excitatory response after pairing of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with postsynaptic depolarization or pairing of pre- and postsynaptic stimulation. Current- and voltage-clamp experiments suggest that <b>this</b> synaptic <b>transformation</b> {{is due to a}} shift from a net increase of conductance to a net decrease of conductance in response to GABA. GABA-induced elevation of intracellular calcium is prolonged after the same stimulus pairing and may, therefore, contribute to <b>this</b> synaptic <b>transformation</b> via Ca(2 +) -activated phosphorylation pathways. <b>This</b> synaptic <b>transformation,</b> which does not follow unpaired stimulus presentations, occurs in a neuronal compartment spatially separated from the soma, which also changes during stimulus pairing...|$|R
