40|$|Serializability is a {{prominent}} correctness criterion for an interleaved execution of concurrent transactions. Serializability guarantees that the interleaved execution of concurrent transactions corresponds to some serial {{execution of the}} same transactions. Many important business applications, however, require the system to impose a partial serialization order between <b>transactions</b> <b>pinned</b> to a specific point in time and conventional transactions that attempt to commit before, at, or after that point in time. This report introduces temporal faithfulness as a new correctness criterion for such cases. Temporal faithfulness does not require real-time capabilities but ensures that the serialization order {{of a set of}} business transactions is not in conflict with precedence requirements between them. The report also shows how a temporally faithful transaction scheduler can be built by extending proven scheduling techniques. ...|$|R

In conventional method identification is done based on ID cards and static 4 digit password. Whereas in our purposed system, Bankers will collect the customer fingerprints and mobile number at the time of opening the accounts then only customer will be able to access ATM machine. The primary step of this project is to verify currently scanned fingerprint with the fingerprint which is registered in the bank during the account opening time. If the two fingerprints get matched, then a message will be delivered to the user’s mobile which is the random 4 digit pin number to access the account. For every <b>transaction</b> new <b>pin</b> numbers will be send to the user’s mobile thus there will not be fixed pin number for every <b>transaction.</b> Thus, <b>Pin</b> number will vary during each transaction...|$|R

40|$|Card {{payments}} {{are getting more}} and more popular across the world. The dominant standard used for Electronic Funds Transfer transaction is EMV. It is widely used across Europe and Canada, and currently it is being introduced in the USA. The most frequently used Cardholder Verification Method in EMV <b>transaction</b> is <b>PIN,</b> which requires from the payment terminal to be equipped with pinpad - which increases the cost of the whole payment device. In this article I present an alternative Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) that can be used instead of traditional PIN. The key advantage of the presented mechanism is that it can be easily implemented in currently utilized authorization protocols, it does not affect rules of EMV specification and may decrease time of transaction processing...|$|R

To pay using this system, a customer passes the card within 4 cm of a reader at a merchant checkout. Using this method, for transactions under $100, the customer {{does not need to}} authenticate his or her identity by PIN entry or signature, as on a regular EFTPOS machine. For <b>transactions</b> over $100, <b>PIN</b> verification is required.|$|R
5000|$|A PIN pad or PIN {{entry device}} is an {{electronic}} device {{used in a}} debit, credit or smart card-based transaction to accept and encrypt the cardholder's personal identification number (PIN). PIN pads are normally used with automated teller machines and integrated point of sale devices in which an electronic cash register is responsible for taking the sale amount and initiating/handling the <b>transaction.</b> The <b>PIN</b> pad is required so that the customer card can be accessed (in the case of chip cards) and the PIN can be securely entered and encrypted before it {{is sent to the}} transaction manager of the switch or the bank. In some cases, with chip cards, the PIN is only transferred from the PIN pad to the chip (within the PIN pad itself) and it is verified by the chip card. In this case the PIN {{does not need to be}} sent to the bank or card scheme for verification. (This is known as [...] "offline PIN verification".) ...|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} payment devices, {{contactless}} cards {{have a number}} of security features. Depending on the economic space, there may be a payment limit on single transactions, and some contactless cards can only be used a certain number of times before customers are asked for their PIN. Contactless debit and credit transactions use the same chip and PIN network as older cards and are protected by the same fraud guarantees. Where PIN is supported, the contactless part of the card remains non-functional until a standard chip and <b>PIN</b> <b>transaction</b> has been executed. This provides some verification that the card was delivered to the actual cardholder.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} PIN {{procedures}} for the operation of a high security interchange <b>transaction.</b> The supplied <b>PIN</b> is encrypted at the entry terminal, during this step, a secret cryptographic key is used. In addition to other transaction elements, the encrypted PIN is transmitted to the acquirer's system. Then, the encrypted PIN is routed from the acquirer's system to a Hardware Security Module. Within it, the PIN is decrypted. With a cryptographic key used for interchange, the decrypted key is immediately reencrypted and is routed to the issuer's system over normal communications channels. Lastly, the routed PIN is decrypted in the issuer's security module and then validated {{on the basis of}} the techniques for on-line local PIN validation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} imperfect contract enforcement {{on the extent of}} the division of labor and the pattern of trade. We consider a world economy comprising two large countries, with a continuum of goods and one factor of production, labor. Each good is characterized by its complexity, defined as the number of elementary tasks that must be performed to produce one unit. There are increasing returns to scale in the performance of each task, which creates gains from the division of labor. When contracts are not perfectly enforced, the trade-off between these gains and <b>transaction</b> costs <b>pins</b> down the size of productive teams across sectors in each country. When the two countries open up to trade, the country where teams are larger under autarky — in efficiency units of labor — specializes in the more complex goods. In our model, it is the country where the product of institutional quality and workers’ productivity is larger. Institutions and productivity levels are complementary sources of comparative advantage. Our model predicts that when institutional improvement and productivity gains occur in developed countries, all countries gain; but that when they occur in developing countries, developed countries might be hurt...|$|R
50|$|<b>PIN</b> <b>transactions</b> {{are usually}} free to the customer, but the {{retailer}} is charged per-transaction and monthly fees. Equens, an association with all major banks as its members, runs the system, and until August 2005 also charged for it. Responding to allegations of monopoly abuse, it has handed over contractual responsibilities to its member banks through who now offer competing contracts. The system is organised through a special banking association Currence set up specifically to coordinate access to payment {{systems in the}} Netherlands. Interpay, a legal predecessor of Equens, was fined €47 million in 2004, but the fine was later dropped, and a related fine for banks was lowered from €17 million to €14 million. Per-transaction fees are between 5-10 eurocents, depending on volume.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal features of both a Visa credit card and the Oyster product, Barclaycard OnePulse included the ability to pay for low value items under £20 using the Visa contactless system by waving the card over a reader in participating outlets. Purchases made using either the contactless or standard payment methods were debited directly from the Barclaycard account {{as opposed to being}} deducted from the Oyster Pre-Pay account. No PIN was necessary for contactless transactions, providing a similar customer experience to Oyster. The chip in the card contained risk management logic that prompted the cardholder to revert to a normal (contact) chip and <b>PIN</b> <b>transaction</b> from time to time for security. The standard consumer protections associated with credit cards also applied to contactless transactions, so the consumer was protected in the event of unauthorised use of their card.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{available}} in English and DutchGuidelines are presented to cope with identity problems in chains. A chain is a collaboration of {{a great number of}} autonomous organisations and professionals to tackle a dominant chain problem. In many chains identity fraud is an aspect of the dominant chain problem. Identity fraud is using some-body else's identity with malicious intent to acquire goods or rights that one is not entitled to. Traces inherently point to the victim, the culprit remaining hidden behind the misused identity. Therefore, only prevention can effectively reduce identity fraud by deterring a fraudster or getting him caught red-handed. Prevention in a chain process can be achieved by simultaneous multifactor identity verifications (token, <b>PIN,</b> <b>transaction</b> code, etc.), because an identity fraudster is unable to manipulate them all consistently at the same time. Multifactor identity verification in a closed interactive communication loop also produces meta-data (for example, the result of a calculation or a telephone number) {{that can be used for}} consistency checking, as well...|$|R
50|$|In the UK {{debit cards}} (an {{integrated}} EFTPOS system) are an established {{part of the}} retail market and are widely accepted both by bricks and mortar stores and by internet stores. The term EFTPOS is not widely used by the public; debit card is the generic term used. Debit cards commonly issued are Debit MasterCard and Visa Debit, with Maestro, Visa Electron and UnionPay also in circulation. Banks do not charge customers for EFTPOS transactions in the UK, but some retailers make small charges, particularly where the transaction amount in question is small. The UK has converted all debit cards in circulation to Chip and PIN (except for Chip and Signature cards issued to people with certain disabilities and non-reloadable prepaid cards), based on the EMV standard, to increase <b>transaction</b> security; however, <b>PINs</b> are not required for internet transactions (though some banks employ additional security measures for online transactions such as Verified by Visa and MasterCard Secure Code), nor for most contactless transactions.|$|R
5000|$|The Chip and PIN {{implementation}} was criticised {{as designed}} to reduce the liability of banks in cases of claimed card fraud by requiring the customer {{to prove that they}} had acted [...] "with reasonable care" [...] to protect their PIN and card, rather than on the bank having to prove that the signature matched. Before Chip and PIN, if a customer's signature was forged, the banks were legally liable and had to reimburse the customer. Until 1 November 2009 there was no such law protecting consumers from fraudulent use of their Chip and <b>PIN</b> <b>transactions,</b> only the voluntary Banking Code. While this code stated that the burden of proof is on the bank to prove negligence or fraud rather than the cardholder having to prove innocence, there were many reports that banks refused to reimburse victims of fraudulent card use, claiming that their systems could not fail under the circumstances reported, despite several documented successful large-scale attacks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} {{a method of}} deriving PINs from passwords. The method is useful to obtain friction-free user onboarding to mobile platforms. It has significant business benefits to organizations that wish to introduce mobile apps to existing users – but which are reluctant to make the users authenticate with passwords. From the user’s perspective, a PIN is easier to enter than a password, and a derived PIN {{does not need to}} be remembered – assuming the user can recall her password. The use of tiered authentication – relying on both PINs and passwords – hardens systems against compromise. This is because <b>transactions</b> relying on <b>PINs</b> can have lower transaction limits and flagging thresholds than transactions authenticated using passwords. Even though our PINs are derived from passwords, they do not contain sufficient information about the passwords to make the passwords easy to infer from compromised PINs. We quantify exactly how much information about the passwords and the derived PINs contain, and how much information is lost – based on reallife password distributions. We also assess the usability of the proposed method using one 25 -subject qualitative study and one 100 -subject quantitative study.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} software (SW) synthesis using Embedded System Environment (ESE), a {{tool set}} for design of multicore embedded systems. We propose a classication of multicore embedded systems {{based on their}} platform architecture. We identify key design decisions and models that are required for embedded system synthesis. We present a a model based design methodology that starts with an application model consisting of C processes communicating via abstract message passing channels. The application model is mapped to a platform net-list of SW and hardware (HW) cores, buses and buffers. A high speed Transaction Level Model (TLM) is generated to validate abstract com-munication between processes mapped to different cores. The TLM is further rened into a Pin-Cycle Accurate Model (PCAM) for board implementation. The PCAM includes C code for all the communication layers including routing, packeting, synchronization and bus transfer. The generated embedded SW provides a library of application level services to the C processes on individual SW cores. Therefore, the application developer {{does not need to}} write low level SW for board implementation. Synthesis results for multi-core MP 3 decoder and JPEG encoder designs, using ESE, show that the embedded SW is generated in order of seconds, compared to hours of manual coding. The quality of synthesized code is comparable to manually written code in terms of performance and code size. Over 3 X productivity gain in overall multicore design is shown to result from automatic SW synthesis.
