This system is ideal for use in credit cards and similar identification cards {{which are based on}} "data transfer by contact" which at present uses the conventional using integrated circuits (IC) or magnetic strips. The system consists of the design of a compatible low cost tag as well as the measurement set up using a metallic cavity. Using the presented technique it is easily possible to code 23 bits within the dimensions of a conventional credit card. Emphasis is <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>security</b> <b>as</b> well as larger data capability. It can be seen that the presented technique is robust and cost effective compared to the existing techniques and {{can be used as a}} viable alternative in identification cards based on data transfer by contact...|$|R
60|$|Scotland had {{a strong}} will of its own yet, however. King Edward, {{determined}} that the Scottish King should not forget he was his vassal, summoned him repeatedly to come and defend himself and his judges before the English Parliament when appeals from the decisions of Scottish courts of justice were being heard. At length, John Baliol, who had no great heart of his own, had so much heart put into him by the brave spirit of the Scottish people, who took this as a national insult, that he refused to come any more. Thereupon, the King further required him to help him in his war abroad (which was then in progress), and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up, <b>as</b> <b>security</b> for his good behaviour in future, the three strong Scottish Castles of Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and Berwick. Nothing of this being done; on the contrary, the Scottish people concealing their King among their mountains in the Highlands and showing a determination to resist; Edward marched to Berwick with an army of thirty thousand foot, and four thousand horse; took the Castle, and slew its whole garrison, and {{the inhabitants of the}} town as well--men, women, and children. LORD WARRENNE, Earl of Surrey, then went on to the Castle of Dunbar, before which a battle was fought, and the whole Scottish army defeated with great slaughter. The victory being complete, the Earl of Surrey was left as guardian of Scotland; the principal offices in that kingdom were <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Englishmen; the more powerful Scottish Nobles were obliged to come and live in England; the Scottish crown and sceptre were brought away; and even the old stone chair was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, where you may see it now. Baliol had the Tower of London lent him for a residence, with permission to range about within a circle of twenty miles. Three years afterwards he was allowed to go to Normandy, where he had estates, and where he passed the remaining six years of his life: far more happily, I dare say, than he had lived for a long while in angry Scotland.|$|R
40|$|The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) {{protocol}} plays a {{vital role}} in Web Services Security. Though the HTTPs provide excellent security, they are not flexible enough to allow caches. HTTPi provides high integrity and low security whereas HTTPs provide low integrity and high security. The goal of WS activity is to build up set of technologies in order to direct WS to their complete prospective application. WS play an excellent role, without which the internet applications cannot be made. To provide both high security and high integrity in Web Services (WS), a new model is proposed. In this model, the combined HTTPs&rsquo;s security and HTTPi&rsquo;s flexibility are considered to provide the best WS. In addition, the user affords the self encrypted data for privacy preserving the requester agent. Finally, the requester agent encrypts the particular data so as to create two protections known as self protection and agent protection. Due to mounting threats in the WS, numerous developers and researchers attempt to enhance additional safekeeping in service level. When WS usages are constantly increasing, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>give</b> proper <b>security</b> <b>as</b> well as flexibility in WS. The requester agent sends the data to the next level. In this message level, the header information can be self verified through appropriate security mechanism proposed in the model. The results of this proposal are compared with the existing methods and better performance is obtained by calculating the throughput and response time...|$|R
