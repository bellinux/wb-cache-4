[...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Even</b> Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E
2500|$|Asquith demoted or {{dismissed}} {{a number}} of Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet ministers. Lord Tweedmouth, the First Lord of the Admiralty, was relegated to the nominal post of Lord President of the Council. Lord Elgin was sacked from the Colonial Office and the Earl of Portsmouth (whom Asquith had tutored) was too, as undersecretary at the War Office. The abruptness of their dismissals caused hard feelings; Elgin wrote to Tweedmouth, [...] "I venture to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> a prime minister may have some regard for the usages common among gentlemen… I feel that even a housemaid gets a better warning." ...|$|E
50|$|Chemerinsky {{supports}} {{gun control}} and {{disagreed with the}} decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if an individual {{right to bear arms}} exists, the District of Columbia was justified in restricting that right because it believed that the law would lessen violence. George Will specifically mentioned and responded to Chemerinsky's argument in a column that ran four days later.|$|R
50|$|Taub has {{problems}} with his wife, because she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> {{at the age of}} 40 he's still doing an intern's job, instead of having his own private practice. Taub convinces her that he confronted House for keeping him from Thanksgiving dinner by showing her a picture of House's beaten-up face (by Chase), claiming he was responsible, which soothes her.|$|R
500|$|According to Liberty, the Marquis idea {{most likely}} to be disbelieved is his claim that the Northern Cheyennes held a conference with their bitter enemies, the Crows, in July 1875 to discuss {{territorial}} borders. However, Liberty <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> this idea is worthy of further consideration, and offers other evidence of a slow thaw in Cheyenne–Crow relations. Of the controversial ideas concerning the Cheyenne as a whole, Liberty concludes that, ...|$|R
2500|$|Bisbee {{was asked}} the same question, but {{preferred}} {{to focus on the}} facts of his case. He stressed that [...] "hat was reported to them was basically a headline: 'Things were bad in OB and the administration was responsible.'" [...] Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked about the Pickering test: [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> protected speech could also serve to demonstrate sufficient disruption to the employer's operation that a firing could be justified?" [...] Bisbee conceded that it could, but [...] "it seems to me there has got to be some reasonable basis for thinking that the speech was doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ban {{struggled}} {{to win the}} approval of France. His official biography states that he speaks both English and French, the two working languages of the UN Secretariat. However, he has repeatedly {{struggled to}} answer questions in French from journalists. Ban has repeatedly acknowledged his limitations at French, but assured French diplomats that he was devoted to continuing his study. At a press conference on 11 January 2007, Ban remarked, [...] "My French perhaps could be improved, and I am continuing to work. I have taken French lessons {{over the last few}} months. I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> if my French isn't perfect, I will continue to study it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama's fellow Illinois Democrats praised {{him after}} the speech. [...] Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan reacted by saying, [...] "He is a star...For Barack, the sky's the limit," [...] while Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said, [...] "He hit a grand slam home run." [...] Senate President Emil Jones responded, [...] "It was such a moving speech that I had tears in my eyes...It was electrifying. When I looked around the room, all across the people were so emotional, tears in their eyes. They're crying. A great individual, a great Illinoisan." [...] Governor Rod Blagojevich stated, [...] "After the speech last night, I would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if he had an opponent, he might get 100 percent of the vote." [...] Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley Braun said, [...] "Obama {{represents}} {{the best of what}} we brought from our generation...he represents a kind of division within the Democratic Party. It's not the old left." ...|$|E

60|$|But Mannhardt goes farther. He {{not only}} recognises, as {{everyone}} must do, the Sun, as explicitly named, when he plays {{his part in}} myth, or popular tale (Marchen). He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> when the Sun is not named, his presence, and reference to him, and derivation of the incidents in Marchen from solar myth, may sometimes be detected with great probability (pp. 326, 327). But he adds, 'not that every Marchen contains a reference to Nature; that I am far from asserting' (p. 327).|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{order to}} have found us, {{they would have been}} obliged to meet some of the people here, and they {{probably}} did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> safe, <b>even</b> though everyone had so much to attend to." ...|$|R

60|$|I <b>think,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>even</b> had {{the master}} been {{regarding}} us {{he would have}} seen no reason for mortification {{in the manner of}} his servant. The man was extremely polite and attentive, suggesting various refreshments, such as wine and biscuits, and I never was treated by a lackey with more respect.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't like to <b>think</b> of <b>that</b> <b>even</b> now. I {{felt like}} a murderer while I did it, though my anger was hot against him.

6000|$|... "She would be," [...] Lady Blennington remarked, dryly. [...] "Look at her husband. The {{poor man}} {{ought to have}} known better than to have married her, of course, but do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he looks <b>even</b> {{reasonably}} happy?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Oltenians (Olteni) and Muntenians (Munteni) {{are seen}} as trying to be ingenious and fast-paced, but failing every time.

500|$|Oakley and Weinstein {{decided to}} include Abe in the episode {{because they had}} an [...] "obsession" [...] with old people. Weinstein said they both [...] "love them and seem to really hate them" [...] at the same time. He also said that they enjoy writing for {{characters}} such as Abe and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he and Oakley get to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang". Executive producer David Mirkin thought {{it was difficult to}} make Abe funny because he is a [...] "boring and tedious" [...] character. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though [...] "Abe's doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually funny {{in the context of the}} boring and tedium." [...] Mirkin thought this was a [...] "big challenge, and Bill and Josh pulled it off very well." ...|$|R
