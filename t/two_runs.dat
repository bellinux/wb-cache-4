5|$|Philadelphia {{scored the}} first runs {{of the series}} when Chase Utley {{hit a home run}} with Jayson Werth on base {{in the top of the}} first inning. Tampa Bay loaded the bases in the bottom of the third inning; however, Upton {{grounded}} into an inning-ending double play and the score remained 20. The Phillies extended their lead when Carlos Ruiz batted in Victorino in the fourth inning. A solo home run from Carl Crawford pulled the Rays back within <b>two</b> <b>runs.</b> Tampa Bay added their second run the following inning on an RBI double by Akinori Iwamura. Philadelphia starter Cole Hamels pitched seven innings and allowed only <b>two</b> <b>runs,</b> while Brad Lidge recorded his 47th consecutive save in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Following their four-game {{sweep of}} Milwaukee in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in <b>two</b> <b>runs,</b> while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only <b>two</b> <b>runs.</b> The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored <b>two</b> <b>runs</b> in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed a three-run homer as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E

He played his first ODI in 18 months when he returned for the fourth match at Mohali.

5|$|Returning to {{play for}} Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and {{suffering}} from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. He was more effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than <b>two</b> <b>runs</b> per over across five games.|$|E

5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies {{were hard to}} come by as the season was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring <b>two</b> <b>runs</b> in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the <b>two</b> <b>runs</b> which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E

The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding <b>two</b> <b>runs</b> without taking a wicket.|$|E

The Braves scored <b>two</b> <b>runs</b> {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning but the Indians won the game, 4–3, to clinch the franchise's first World Series title since 1920. Lemon was the only pitcher from either club to win two games in the Series. He finished the Series with a 1.65ERA.|$|E

His one-day form remained strong, with 172 runs at 43.00 in the ODI series in India, as Australia bounced back to win the series 3–2.
