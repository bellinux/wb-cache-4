As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E

5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that}} the Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> {{as an important}} application of moral law to public policy.

5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career.

Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations.

5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.

In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan.

5|$|In 1948 the United States {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> {{initiative to}} help rebuild postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union {{to give up its}} claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation in the form of land and property left behind by the German population of the annexed western territories.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to reach an}} agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program {{led to the creation of}} the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{personal}} expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the CIA and the National Security Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the National Security Agency (NSA).|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the winter {{came at a time}} of heavy {{government}} spending with 15per cent of the GDP being spent on the armed forces and large expenditure on the new National Health Service and post-war reconstruction. This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through <b>the</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E
