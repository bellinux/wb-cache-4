25|$|One {{could say}} that <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> search for the origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to {{penetrate}} and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal matrix. Matter, Substance, represents the absolute origin, the beginning of all things.|$|E
25|$|Her {{secret is}} in her ability to {{transfer}} to the musical plane {{the suffering of the}} character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.|$|E
25|$|The {{secure and}} dismissive {{attachment}} styles {{are associated with}} higher self-esteem compared to <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain {{can be characterized as}} generally positive or generally negative.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} defense mechanisms, repressors (n= 14), highly anxious (n = 37) and low anxious (n = 7) {{groups were}} tested with the Meta Contrast Technique (Smith, Johnson, Almgren & Johanson, 2001). The division into repressors and anxiety groups {{was made on}} a larger group (N = 140), which was also investigated with respect to experienced access to preconscious processes, here operationalized as memory for dreams. Results: The repressors got higher scores on immature defense mechanisms than the highly or low anxious groups (p =. 04 versus p <. 05). The repressors as well as <b>the</b> highly <b>anxious</b> group were higher on a measure of overall defense than <b>the</b> low <b>anxious</b> group (p <. 05 in both comparisons). Regarding the separate defense categories, a {{significant difference was found}} for repression, which was more frequent in <b>the</b> highly <b>anxious</b> than in <b>the</b> low <b>anxious</b> group (p =. 003). Memory for dreams differed only in the men. The male repressors scored significantly lower on dream memory than <b>the</b> highly <b>anxious</b> men (p <. 02). The immature defensive structure in the repressors was discussed in terms of regressive reactions, speculatively {{due to a lack of}} symbolic functioning concerning anxiety-arousing areas, i. e. alexithymia...|$|R

500|$|The {{most radical}} {{figure in the}} New School faction was {{prominent}} evangelist Charles Grandison Finney. Finney's revivals were characterized by his [...] "New Measures", which included protracted meetings, extemporaneous preaching, <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> bench, and prayer groups. Albert Baldwin Dod accused Finney of preaching Pelagianism and urged {{him to leave the}} Presbyterian Church. Finney did just that in 1836 when he joined the Congregational church as pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Further to Laing's {{reading of}} the song's message, author and critic Tim Riley deems the {{barriers}} in communication to be the boundaries imposed by <b>the</b> <b>anxious,</b> Western concept of time, as Harrison instead [...] "seeks healthy exchange and the enlightened possibilities" [...] offered outside such limitations. According to Riley, [...] "the transcendental key" [...] is therefore the song's concluding lines – [...] "I don't mind / I could wait forever, I've got time" [...] – signifying the singer's release from vexation and temporal restrictions.|$|E

500|$|The {{doctors who}} {{attended}} Louise reported she was severely concussed and in shock, and that [...] "it was a wonder her skull was not fractured". Louise's ear {{had been injured}} when her earring caught {{on the side of}} the sleigh, tearing her ear lobe in two. The press played down the story on instructions from Lorne's private secretary, an act that was described by contemporaries as [...] "stupid and ill advised". For example, one New Zealand newspaper reported, [...] "Excepting immediately after the blow, the Princess was perfectly sensible during the whole time..." [...] Knowledge of Louise's true condition might have elicited sympathy from the Canadian people. As it was, one Member of Parliament wrote: [...] "Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I think there was no injury done worth mentioning." [...] Therefore, when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements, people thought she was malingering. News of the accident was also played down in Britain, and in letters home to <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> Queen Victoria.|$|E
500|$|Willis defended Catharine, who {{maintained}} her innocence, in the Home Journal {{and suggested}} that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority. On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court, Forrest beat Willis with a gutta-percha whip in New York's Washington Square, shouting [...] "this man is the seducer of my wife". Willis, who was recovering from a rheumatic fever at the time, was unable to fight back. His wife soon received an anonymous letter with an accusation that Willis was in an adulterous relationship with Catherine Forrest. Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed {{he had seen the}} couple [...] "lying on each other". As the press reported, [...] "thousands and thousands of <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> public" [...] awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.|$|E

500|$|Once riders have {{boarded the}} train, it departs the station {{entering}} the gamma-ray accelerator, where <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> voice of Bruce Banner issues from speakers in the walls: [...] "Everything looks good...I think...I think this time it's...going to work!" [...] On cue, a female voice announces {{that there has}} been a malfunction. Klaxons begin to sound inside the tube as Dr. Banner screams in terror: [...] "No. No! No!! NO!!!" [...] The last [...] "No!" [...] is synchronized with the launch mechanism, which propels the train from 9 to [...] in 2 seconds. Upon exiting the gamma-ray accelerator, the train immediately goes into a zero-g roll, down a [...] drop, and into a cobra roll over the park's main lagoon. Riders complete a vertical loop, then enter a subterranean tunnel full of mist. The train encircles the gamma-ray accelerator and is sent into the back area via corkscrew. A smaller vertical loop wraps around the mid-course brake run, which is flanked by two over-banked turns. The train is slowed down by the mid-course brakes before being sent down another hill to a corkscrew and turn-around. Riders then travel sideways through an on-ride camera zone and then to the ride's final brake run after a helix.|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave Zooropa an [...] "A", {{calling it}} [...] "harried, spontaneous-sounding, and {{ultimately}} exhilarating album". Browne {{noted that it}} sounds [...] "messy" [...] and [...] "disconnected", but clarified [...] "that sense of incoherence is the point" [...] {{in the context of}} the record's technology themes. He concluded, [...] "For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it [...] "captured <b>the</b> <b>anxious,</b> even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour" [...] so much so that [...] "it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour" [...] and yet sounds like a [...] "souvenir" [...] of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a [...] "creative stretch", noting that the band experiments more yet retains their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's [...] "yearning anthemic reach" [...] and [...] "obvious, slinky pop charm" [...] are replaced with [...] "darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a [...] "freewheeling feel of going with the flow" [...] throughout the album and calling it [...] "rootless and loose, restless and unsettled". For Du Noyer, U2 sounded [...] "monstrously tight as a performing unit and fluidly inventive as composers, so the results transcend the merely experimental".|$|E
500|$|Critics harshly {{criticized the}} film's {{controversial}} change in title from Rapunzel to Tangled. Holding Flynn's role and characterization partially responsible for it, they accused {{the character of}} being a marketing tool manipulated by Disney to attract larger male audiences via the film's trailers. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Dawn C. Chmielewski observed that Tangleds marketing campaign involved [...] "amp up {{the role of the}} dashing Errol Flynn-styled male lead to share the spotlight with the golden-haired namesake of the classic Brothers Grimm story". Tom Charity of CNN received Flynn as [...] "an attempt to lure boys and men into the theater". One of the film's trailers features Flynn [...] "trying to win over ... Rapunzel by giving her 'the smolder'" [...] while [...] "emphasiz ... action components ... over the more girl-oriented fairy tale stuff", according to Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine. Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail felt that Flynn was [...] "obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie". Richard Corliss of Time mocked the film's marketing and the idea that [...] "The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish guy ... whose mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside." [...] Referring to the film's title as [...] "idiotic", Matt Neal of the Standard-Examiner wrote, [...] "Disney claims it changed the film's title from Rapunzel to Tangled to emphasise Flynn Rider's role in the film ... but that title-change excuse doesn't fly." [...] The Daily Mails Chris Tookey felt that Flynn's narration [...] "feels wrong", describing it [...] "as a commercially calculated move to reassure males in the audience that the film won't be too 'girly'." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times received Flynn as a [...] "hijacking of a princess's tale", panning the character as [...] "a crude commercial calculation, a sign to <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> boys in the audience that things aren't going to be too girly, or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude." [...] Claire Martin of The Denver Post felt that Flynn's sole purpose in the film was for potential merchandising opportunities, specifically to [...] "take Ken's role as [...] male arm candy".|$|E

Next, the children saw a banner unfurl beneath the Lady. Slowly, a message appeared: But pray, my children. God will hear you in time. My Son allows Himself to be touched.

2500|$|An {{instance}} of the application of <b>the</b> <b>anxious</b> scrutiny level of review is the 1995 case of R. v.

In ex parte Smith, Smith and three other individuals appealed a Ministry of Defence ruling that mandated the discharge of homosexuals from the service. The court accepted that [...] "he more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable". This is {{as long as the}} decision remains within the range of responses open to a reasonable decision-maker.|$|E
