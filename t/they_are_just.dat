5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds herself at {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes that it was just a dream.|$|E

5|$|There {{are among}} other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely {{alongside}} one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> like four streams of thought, each going its own way– differently and randomly for each performance– until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.|$|E
5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who {{has been}} nursing Mark (Paul Schneider) at the {{hospital}} since he fell into the pit, says he has acted much nicer since the incident. Ann also reveals she has broken up with Andy (Chris Pratt). Mark and Leslie kissed before he fell, but both insist <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> friends. Mark tries to ask Ann out, but she declines {{out of respect for}} Leslie's friendship. Meanwhile, the Bulge holds a party in Leslie's honor, which she attends along with Tom (Aziz Ansari) to announce she has not taken a political stand. However, she accepts the free drinks they offer her and ends up getting drunk and having a great time. The next day, she is invited to go on the Pawnee Today talk show to discuss her supposed stance on same-sex marriage with Marcia Langman and television host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army, a third force, not all that much smaller than either, would operate on Dutch soil: the French 7th Army. It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy, and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory. The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of their many waterways. However, both the French and the Germans saw {{the possibility of a}} surprise flanking attack in this region. For the Germans this would have the advantage of bypassing the Antwerp-Namur line. The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> opposite the Thames estuary, so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England.|$|E

5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy and nutrients from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals and nutrients. Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E
5|$|Max's {{daughter}} Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes {{angry at}} Max for never mentioning Bradley, leading to his confessing {{that he knows}} Bradley did not kill Archie. Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, who is no longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> friends and he promised he would always look out for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she knows this. She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone. Lauren later hands the recording to Janine as Stacey and Ryan have begun having an affair. Max wipes the recording so on Christmas Eve, Janine publicly announces in the pub after trying to play the recording that Stacey killed Archie. Outside, Stacey privately tells Ryan that Janine is telling the truth.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E

25|$|The 5-HT3 antagonists {{are also}} {{indicated}} in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV), when needed, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

25|$|Taxis {{are mostly}} {{informal}} and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary {{in size from}} small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for {{a large part of}} the car stock. In many cases <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide on-call taxi service.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play {{a factor in the}} perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). You will see dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light & dark through the body and on legs, distinct & indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> not preferred.|$|E
