40|$|Traditionally, {{irrigation}} pumping {{plants have}} been tested using an instantaneous appraoch, which tests performance parameters over {{a very short time}} interval. Using this method, the tester measures the necessary work and energy use parameters to calculate the desired pumping plant performance values. The primary limitation of this approach is its inability to determine the season long efficiency of an irrigation pumping plant. A new approach to evaluating irrigation pumping plant performance is the use of pump monitoring systems which use high frequency, real-time data collection and telemetry to relay information directly from the pump to the user. This method of testing essentially conducts a continuous pumping plant performance evaluation. Throughout a typical irrigation season, a single pumping plant typically operates at a wide range of <b>total</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>heads</b> as a result of changes in operational conditions due to factors such as aquifer drawdown and irrigation demand changes. When coupled with telemetry, this approach to irrigation pumping plant testing can provide real-time feedback to the irrigator on pumping plant performance, even as the operating conditions of the system changes throughout the season. Nearly 100 pumping years of diesel and electric pumping plant data was evaluated over four irrigation seasons using a network of these pump monitoring systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In several industries, {{like the}} mining business, {{it is very}} common to observe high head pumping systems, which {{transport}} water {{to more than one}} discharge point. These discharge points could have, in some cases, variable discharge pressures and, furthermore, could be utilized as water sources (a water reservoir, for example) for other facilities using the same pipes that feed them (flow in double direction). Because of this particular design, the pumping systems can have different <b>Total</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Head</b> (TDH) depending on the water level in the reservoir(s), resulting in a complication for the design and operation of the pumping systems. The objective of this investigation is to understand the operation of pumping systems with variable reference head, visualize the advantages of this type of design, and better understand related operating problems. In this case study, we analysed the design of an existing system that transports water from a river to a 4. 2 million m 3 reservoir and then on to a base metal process plant. To address this problem, a steady-state analysis was conducted to determine the TDH and flow discharge per pump for several operation scenarios and different types of problems noted from the calculations performed. The first problem was related to the control system being required to supply pumped water directly to the process plant and to the reservoir at the same time. Another problem was related to the performance of the pumps in all pump stations: a broad range of operation in terms of flow discharge. To avoid this type of problem, a redesign or mitigation measures should be considered, like the use of variable frequency drives for the pump motors or the increase of the water tank volume in pump stations.

40|$|The annual {{agricultural}} electric pumping usage in California {{is around}} 10 million MWh {{and most of}} it occurs in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, wher e the majority of agriculture is located (Burt et al., 2003). Pumping costs are often higher than they should be for two reasons: more water is pumped than is necessary, and/or the pumping plant operates inefficiently (either the pump itself is inefficient, or the <b>total</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>head</b> is greater than needed). Ideally, new electric overall pumping plant efficienci es (OPPE) should be at leas t 70 percent (for greater than 25 kilowatts) and every new pumping plant should be tested to verify/determine the starting OPPE. Current practices in the California agricultural irri gation market do not typically guarantee a new OPPE, nor are verification tests performed by the pump vendor or others. Pumps that are initially efficien t can become inefficient through pump wear, changes in groundwater conditions, and changes in the irrigation system (Hanson, 1988). Options for improving OPPE include adjusting impellers, repairing or replacing worn pu mps, replacing mismatched pumps, and converting to energy efficient electric motors (Hanson, 2002). Variable frequency drives, while not improving the OPPE, reduce the input kW by only produc ing the flow and pressure combin ation that is required at the moment. Pumping plants should be evaluated every several years to determine th e status of the pump and possible reasons for poor efficiency. Evalua ting a pumping plant requires a pump test, during which capacity (flow rate), lift, discharg e pressure and input horsepower are measur ed. Electric utilities such as Pacific Gas and Electric Company have provided such eval uations for over 70 years in California to minimize energy consumption in the irrigation sector. Additional programs have been sponsored by the California Energy Commission (Burt and Howes, 2005). Though pump repair or replacement can substantially improve performa nce, energy savings will also depend on management and the design of the irrigati on system. To reduce electrical energy use, the kilowatt-hours must decrease because of fewer kilo watts (kW) or less operati ng time, or both. If the new/repaired pump produces a higher flow rate than before, the hours of operation must be reduced to deliver the same volume; operating the same number of hours can use just as much electricity as before. Irrigation pumps are typica lly overdesigned to cope with the worst working conditions (normally peak demands, and low groundwater levels) but this means that in normal operation the pump will use more kW than necessary for a desired flow rate. In such cases, installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) allows pumps to run at slower speeds in cases of lower demand (pressure or flow rate), requiring less kW â even though the impeller/bowl efficiency may be lower than at the maximum design flow rate and pressure. High efficiency motors should save 3 - 5 % of their operating co st, although some motors labeled as being âhigh efficiencyâ a ppear to have lower efficiency th an standard motors (Burt et al. 2008). The points above are well known in concept. However, information from large da tasets of actual pump performance is difficult to obtain.
