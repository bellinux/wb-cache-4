40|$|A fully printed ring {{oscillator}} circuit is reported, {{which has not}} only horizontally arranged parts, but inverter stages stacked vertically {{on top of each}} other in four <b>through-connected</b> substrate layers. For the preparation of the inverters exclusively gravure and flexographic printing were used. Characteristics of the stacked {{ring oscillator}} are similar to planar circuits. A very interesting path of development for printed electronics is opened with this approach, because three-dimensional circuits become possible...|$|E
40|$|Electropolymerization of o-aminophenol at planar glassy {{carbon and}} ultraporous carbon nanofoam {{electrodes}} in buffered aqueous electrolytes produces an ultrathin coating of poly(o-aminophenol), POAP. Poly(o-aminophenol) is not electroactive at the deposition pH of 4. 7, {{and thus the}} electrodeposited POAP film rapidly passivates the electrode surface against further monomer oxidation. The self-limiting nature of the deposition process allows ultrathin coatings to be deposited onto and within ultraporous electrode structures without occluding the <b>through-connected</b> pore network of the nanofoam. When transferred to acidic aqueous electrolytes, POAP protonates and becomes electroactive. The charge-storage capacity for the resulting composite POAP-coated carbon is higher than that for bare carbon because of the added faradaic electrochemical reactions from the polymer coating...|$|E
40|$|Silicate-based oxides are of {{interest}} as electrolytes and electrode materials in intermediate-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). [1 – 7] We have developed a sol–gel-based strategy {{for the production of}} mesoporous, nanostructured, singlephase La 9. 33 Si 6 O 26 apatite in an aerogel-type framework. Silicon alkoxides react with lanthanum(III) aqueous ions in alcohol solutions driven by a proton-scavenging agent, propylene oxide. Varying the means by which pore fluid is removed from the resultant lanthanum silicate gels yields three distinct pore–solid monolithic nanoarchitectures: aerogels, ambigels, and xerogels. The ambigel and aerogel nanoarchitectures exhibit high specific surface areas (from 285 to 408 m 2 g– 1), aperiodic <b>through-connected</b> networks of mesopores, and covalently bonded networks of non-agglomerated nanoparticles. Calcination at relatively mild temperatures for this oxide (800 °C) converts the amorphous gels to nanocrystalline apatite La 9. 33 Si 6 O 26. Although densified during calcination, the aerogel and ambigel nanoarchitectures retain porosity, high surface area, and limited particle agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|Fabrication {{of novel}} {{three-dimensional}} material architectures {{is essential for}} successful development of energy storage devices that allow high rate operation along with sufficient energy capacity. To this end, we report a facile methodology to fabricate hierarchically-porous nanofiber-based electrodes for electric double layer capacitors. In particular, blends of polyacrylonitrile and a sacrificial polymer at different compositions were electrospun into non-woven nanofiber mats with the fiber diameter {{in the range of}} 200 – 400 nm and the mat thickness of 150 - 200 µm. Electrospun nanofiber mats were then subjected to carbonization to obtain porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as polyacrylonitrile converted to carbon and the sacrificial polymer decomposed out creating intra-fiber pores resulting in high specific surface areas of upto 1600 m 2 /g. No additional chemical or physical activation process was used. Electrochemical measurements in aqueous electrolyte showed large specific capacitance of up to 210 F g− 1 at a high cyclic voltammetry scan rate of 100 mV s− 1. These materials retain 75 % capacitance at a large current density of 20 A g− 1 indicating excellent power handling capability. These porous CNFs provided an ideal three-dimensional, free standing (without any binders) electrode design with multi-levels of pore sizes; <b>through-connected</b> Macropores (~ 500 nm- 1 µm), created due to inter-fiber spacing in the nanofiber mat & Micro (d < 2 nm) and/or Meso pores (2 <d< 50 nm) created in each nanofiber due to decomposition of sacrificial polymer. While the intra-fiber pores provided large specific surface areas and hence large capacity, the inter-fiber pores facilitated the permeation of electrolyte to the carbon surfaces to allow fast charge adsorption/desorption and enhanced power handling capability...|$|E
