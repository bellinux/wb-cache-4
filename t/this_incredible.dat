Within two hours, we had <b>this</b> <b>incredible</b> seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} Canada’s {{national}} policy toward Latin America – and {{other regions of}} the globe – had almost completely diverged from that of the United States. This was an especially momentous time in Canadian foreign politics because, until this point, Canada had been under the vast political and economic influence of her neighbour to the South. <b>This</b> <b>incredible</b> divergence was essentially manifested in Mitchell Sharp’s “Options for the Future” (otherwise known as the ‘Third Option Paper’), which reaffirmed the tenets of “Foreign Policy for Canadians”, but considered U.S.-Canada relations in greater detail. Sharp’s paper advocated the growth of Canadian economic, political and cultural ‘distinctiveness’, but did not encourage alienation from America. Ultimately, Sharp’s ideas had a profound and lasting effect on Canadian policy and were central to the outward growth of Canada in the international sphere for many years.|$|E
