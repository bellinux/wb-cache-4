40|$|Biodiversity is {{unevenly}} distributed on Earth and hotspots {{of biodiversity}} are {{often associated with}} areas that have undergone orogenic activity during recent geological history (i. e. {{tens of millions of}} years). Understanding the underlying processes that have driven the accumulation of species in some areas and not in others may help guide prioritization in conservation and may facilitate forecasts on ecosystem services under future climate conditions. Consequently, the study of the origin and evolution of biodiversity in mountain systems has motivated growing scientific interest. Despite an increasing number of studies, the origin and evolution of diversity hotspots associated with the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) remains poorly understood. We review literature related to the diversification of organisms linked to the uplift of the QTP. To promote hypothesis-based research, we provide a geological and palaeoclimatic scenario for the region of the QTP and argue that further studies would benefit from providing a complete set of complementary analyses (molecular dating, biogeographic, and diversification rates analyses) to test for a link between organismic diversification and past geological and climatic changes in this region. In general, we found that the contribution of biological interchange between the QTP and other hotspots of biodiversity has not been sufficiently studied to date. Finally, we suggest that the biological consequences of the uplift of the QTP would be best understood using a meta-analysis approach, encompassing studies on a variety of organisms (plants and animals) from diverse habitats (forests, meadows, rivers), and <b>thermal</b> <b>belts</b> (montane, subalpine, alpine, nival).

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of eddy covariance for understanding terrestrial carbon exchange has been hampered by uncertainty over {{the magnitude and}} causes of a systematic underestimation of CO 2 efflux on calm nights. We combined in situ measurements of the temperature, wind and CO 2 profile with nocturnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) to infer the patterns of cold air drainage in an Amazonian tropical forest. The meteorological tower was located on a flat plateau that sloped gently to the southwest. The vertical profile from 0 to 64 m above ground level was divisible into two air parcels at night: a warm, low CO 2, upper parcel and a cool, high CO 2, lower parcel that was stable {{with respect to the}} upper parcel. The nocturnal wind direction of the upper parcel was from the east, a pattern that is consistent with the general circulation, whereas the wind direction of the lower parcel was from the northeast, a pattern that implies drainage down the local topographic gradient. The nocturnal patterns of LST were closely related to local topography and land use. In general, a nearby river was warm, gullies were cold, plateau centers were cold, stream drainages were cold, pastures were particularly cold, and upper slopes and plateau edges were warm. The in situ temperature and wind observations, combined with the observed relationship between elevation and nocturnal LST and the occurrence of warm <b>thermal</b> <b>belts</b> extending inward from the edges of plateaus, imply that cold air drainage occurs on clear nights. The slope of the relationship between LST and elevation varied between nights, indicating that the degree of thermal stratification, and possibly the extent of cold air drainage, also varied. The night-tonight variation in stratification across the landscape was correlated with the vertical temperature gradient at the tower but not the above-canopy friction velocity (u*). Criteria associated with vertical temperature gradients may prove better than u* for screening nocturnal eddy covariance observations to eliminate periods that underestimate CO 2 flux...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Ellsworth Mountains, first mapped {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Campbell Craddock, pose critical geological enigmas, solved and unsolved. The isolation of the mountains, their abrupt structural terminations and Paleozoic stratigraphic affinities are explained by rotation from the cratonic margin during Gondwanaland breakup. The mechanism remains obscure. The absence of intense folding associated with the Cambro-Ordovician Ross orogeny can be ascribed to local extension along a subducting margin. Yet tantalizing questions regarding possible Precambrian connections to Laurentia remain, and the cause of the post-Permian Gondwanide folding is controversial. The elevation (~ 5000 m) is high for an early Mesozoic fold <b>belt.</b> <b>Thermal</b> uplift could have been initiated during Jurassic-Cretaceous block rotation and Weddell Sea opening and continued into the Cenozoic.

40|$|In the {{southern}} Apennines fold and thrust <b>belt,</b> <b>thermal</b> indicators record exhumation of sedimentary units from depths locally {{in excess of}} 5 km. The belt is made of allochthonous sedimentary units that overly a 6 8 km thick, carbonate footwall succession. The latter is deformed by reverse faults involving the underlying basement. Therefore, a switch from thin-skinned to thick-skinned thrusting occurred as the Apulian Platform carbonates - and the underlying continental lithosphere - were deformed during the latest shortening stages. Apatite fission track data, with cooling ages ranging between 9. 2 ± 1. 0 and 1. 5 ± 0. 8 Ma, indicate that exhumation marks these late tectonic stages, probably initiating with the buttressing of the allochthonous wedge against the western margin of the Apulian Platform. Pliocene-Pleistocene foreland advancing of the allochthonous units exceeds {{the total amount of}} slip that could be transferred {{to the base of the}} allochthon from the underlying thick-skinned structures.

40|$|This PhD Thesis {{presents}} the Tertiary kinematic {{evolution of the}} South-Central Pyrenees from the integration of magnetostratigraphic, magnetotectonic and thermochronological analyses on its synorogenic sedimentary record. One of the main contributions of this PhD thesis is the continuous absolute dating of the syntectonic conglomerates of La Pobla de Segur, Senterada and Sis. Magnetostratigraphy of these materials establishes their deposition during Middle Eocene-Late Oligocene times (from chron 19 r up to chron 9 n). Integration of these results with previous magnetostratigraphic works within the Ainsa Basin has allowed {{the establishment of a}} new chronostratigraphy for the Eocene-Oligocene materials of the South-Central Pyrenees. The obtained chronostratigraphy has biochronological implications as it substantially changes the traditionally accepted ages of the European reference levels MP 14 to MP 17. MP 14 and MP 15 reference levels are proposed to correlate to Lutetian whereas MP 16 and MP 17 would be Bartonian in age. These results reveal that the correlation between the continental and marine Paleogene record needs further refinement and therefore, that the chronostratigraphic age attributions based on MP reference levels should be taken with caution. The magnetostratigraphic ages have been combined with detrital thermochronology on 13 granitic cobbles enclosed in the syntectonic conglomerates. The detrital apatite fission track ages obtained vary from 63 to 27 Ma. When these ages are combined with the stratigraphic ages, samples define 5 groups with thermochronological ages generally increasing down-section except in the most deeply buried ones due to post-depositional partial annealing. Thermal models reveal three periods of rapid-cooling within the Axial Zone due to movement on large-thrust sheets. A dramatic increase in exhumation rate occurred during the latest Eocene-Early Oligocene related to the onset of movement in the Rialp thrust sheet and the increase in structural relief of the Axial Zone by underthrusting. The magnetostratigraphic and thermochronological ages obtained permit the link between the sedimentation rates in the surrounding basins and the exhumation rates in the hinterland, and reveal that accommodation space exerted the main control on sedimentation rates within the piggy-back basins. Post-depositional annealing of the stratigraphically lowest samples suggests about 2 km of burial by the younger synorogenic materials during progressive burial of the South Pyrenean fold and thrust <b>belt.</b> <b>Thermal</b> models also suggest a rapid exhumation event during the Late Neogene, linked to re-excavation caused by the base level drop during the Ebro River capture to the Mediterranean Sea. Sedimentation of the studied synorogenic materials during Middle Eocene-Oligocene times occurred coeval to the development of thrust salients in the southern Pyrenees. The magnetotectonic study of 36 sites carried out in the Ainsa Oblique Zone reveal clockwise vertical-axis rotations varying from ~ 80 ° in the lower Lutetian materials of the Mediano anticline to ~ 20 ° in middle Ilerdian materials cropping out at the northern edge of the Añisclo anticline. Sites in {{the central part of the}} Montsec and Bóixols thrust sheets don’t record any significant rotation as neither do the syntectonic materials of La Pobla, Sis and Senterada. The age of the main rotation event within the Gavarnie thrust sheet is constrained to Lutetitan to Bartonian times, when all the structures of the Ainsa Oblique Zone were active. This vertical-axis rotation stage obeys to a difference of ~ 50 km in the amount of displacement on the Gavarnie thrust sheet controlled by the NE-SW pinch out of the Triassic salts at its basal detachment. A second rotation event of ~ 10 ° took place since Priabonian times, as a result of the differential displacement of about 22 km of the Serres Marginals thrust sheet, respect the Gavarnie one, on top of the upper Eocene-Oligocene evaporites. The synchronicity between thrusting and vertical-axis rotations suggests that the curved fold and thrust belt formed by progressive curvature with divergent thrust transport. The results exposed in this Thesis reveal a strong relationship between the stratigraphic record of the synorogenic materials, thrusting and exhumation in the Axial Zone and the structural evolution of the South Pyrenean thrust system. Tectonic forces controlled the observed patterns of exhumation, the evolution of the synorogenic topography of the piggy-back and foreland basins and the depositional features of the synorogenic sediments. Aquesta tesi presenta l’evolució cinemàtica dels Pirineus centre-meridionals durant el Terciari a partir de la integració de dades magnetostratigràfiques, termocronològiques I magnetotectòniques del seu registre sinorogènic. La datació magnetostratigràfica dels conglomerats sintectònics de La Pobla de Segur, Senterada i Sis, fixa la seva edat en Eocè mig-Oligocè superior (cron 19 r a cron 9 n). Aquests resultats permeten establir una nova cronostratigrafia pels materials eocens-oligocens dels Pirineus centre-meridionals de la que deriven implicacions biocronològiques, ja que canvia substancialment les edats acceptades del nivells de referència europeus MP 14 a MP 17. Les edats magnetostratigràfiques s’han combinat amb termocronologia detrítica de blocs de granit dels conglomerats sintectònics. La termocronologia obtinguda varia de 63 a 27 Ma. Els models tèrmics revelen tres períodes de refredament ràpid relacionats amb el moviment de grans encavalcaments a la Zona Axial, destacant l’ocorregut a l’Eocè superior-Oligocè inferior degut al moviment de l’encavalcament de Rialp i a l’increment de relleu a la Zona Axial per underthrusting. L’annealing post-deposicional de les mostres estratigràficament més baixes suggereix que el cinturó de plecs i encavalcaments pirinenc va estar cobert per 2 km de materials. Els models tèrmics també suggereixen una exhumació ràpida al Miocè superior, relacionada amb la captura de l’Ebre al Mediterrani. Durant la sedimentació dels materials sinorogènics estudiats té lloc la formació de thrust salients als Pirineus meridionals entre els que destaca la Zona Obliqua d’Ainsa. L’estudi magnetotectònic dut a terme en aquesta zona revela rotacions verticals que varien de ~ 80 º a Mediano a ~ 20 º al nord d’Añisclo. L’edat de la rotació principal a la làmina de Gavarnie s’estableix en el Lutecià-Bartonià, quan eren actives totes les estructures de la Zona Obliqua d’Ainsa, i estaria causada per una diferència de 50 km en la quantitat de desplaçament de la làmina de Gavarnie controlada per la distribució de les sals triàsiques al seu desenganxament basal. La sincronia entre encavacalments i rotacions apunta a un model d’arc progressiu amb transport divergent. Aquests resultats revelen una estreta relació entre el registre estratigràfic dels materials sinorogènics, els encavalcaments i l’exhumació a la Zona Axial i l’evolució estructural del sistema d’envacalments dels Pirineus meridionals.

After sunset, the cold air layer suddenly appeared and developed, and its thickness was kept being about 20 m through the night. The site where down-slope winds take off the surface was confirmed to be {{the central part of}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>belt</b> on the slope. The down-slope wind speed decreased gradually as the night progressed, which seems to be due to the ascent of the surface of the cold air lake that was developing above the foot of the mountain. The relation between the drainage wind speed and the potential temperature deficit in the cold-air-drainage layer can be explained by the equilibrium flow model by Mori et al. (1999). 四王寺山南東斜面における冷気流の特徴として以下のような知見を得た. 1) 日の入り後, 冷気層は急激に発達し, 夜間, その厚さは譯 20 mでほぼ一定であった. 2) 冷気流が斜面を離れる場所は斜面温暖帯の中心部と一致した. 3) 冷気流速は夜半から朝方にかけて漸減したが, 冷気湖面が次第に上昇し, その影響が現れた可能性が高い. 4) 冷気流速と温位欠損の関係は平衡冷気流モデル(森ら, 1999) により説明できた...|$|E

Using a {{spatially}} distributed temperature logger, 1. 5 m above the land surface, it was revealed that the maximum temperature is centered around 200 @ 250 m above sea level (a. s. l.), especially developing in the early morning. The vertical temperature profile was observed by use of captive balloons. Strong surface inversion, in excess of 4 C, occurred {{in the bottom of the}} mountain around daybreak, while the vertical distribution of temperature at 150 m a. s. l. is uniform, roughl...|$|E
