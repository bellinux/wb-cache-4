50|$|Two {{types of}} wiring {{protection}} are standard <b>thermal</b> <b>breakers</b> and arc fault circuit <b>breakers.</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>breakers</b> require an overload condition {{long enough that}} a heating element in the breaker trips the breaker off. In contrast, arc fault circuit breakers use magnetic or other means to detect increases in current draw much more quickly. Without such protection, visually detecting arc faults in defective wiring is very difficult, as the arc fault occurs {{in a very small}} area. A problem with arc fault circuit breaker is {{they are more likely to}} produce false positives due to normal circuit behaviors appearing to be arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes on the outside of an aircraft mimic arc faults in their voltage and current profiles. Research has been able to largely eliminate such false positives, however, providing the ability to quickly identify and locate repairs that need to be done.|$|R

25|$|Some {{companies}} manufacture resettable miniature <b>thermal</b> circuit <b>breakers,</b> which screw into a fuse socket. Some installations {{use these}} Edison-base circuit breakers. However, any such breaker sold today does have one flaw. It may {{be installed in}} a circuit-breaker box with a door. If so, if the door is closed, the door may hold down the breaker's reset button. While in this state, the breaker is effectively useless: it does not provide any overcurrent protection.|$|R
50|$|Self-blast or <b>thermal</b> blast circuit <b>breakers</b> are now {{accepted}} {{world wide}} {{and they have}} been in service for high-voltage applications for about 25 years by ABB, and later by Areva, starting with the voltage level of 72.5 kV. Today this technique is also available for the voltage levels 420/550/800 kV.|$|R
50|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} have lower resistance as they heat up; if connected directly across a power bus, for protection against electrical transients, a varistor with a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway {{and sometimes a}} small explosion or fire. To prevent this, the fault current is typically limited by a <b>thermal</b> fuse, circuit <b>breaker,</b> or other current limiting device.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of electrical plant, equipment, and components in aerospace applications {{is currently a}} hot research topic, with particular attention being paid to parallel arc fault detection. It {{is well known that}} many conventional <b>thermal</b> magnetic <b>breakers</b> do not offer adequate protection against arc faults, and the results can be similar to those produced by a short-circuit; electric faults are one of the main causes of failures in aircrafts, and their effects can be even catastrophic [1] and [2]. For these reasons, it is mandatory to employ effective protection devices in order to quickly detect and isolate the failures. Overcurrent and overload protection is well carried out by conventional thermal and magnetic breakers; unfortunately, reliability is not assured when the fault is due to an arc...|$|R
5000|$|Metal oxide varistors {{typically}} develop lower resistance as they heat up. If connected {{directly across}} an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which {{has developed a}} lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire. [...] To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a <b>thermal</b> fuse, circuit <b>breaker,</b> or other current limiting device.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{electrical}} fuses {{or circuit}} <b>breakers,</b> <b>thermal</b> fuses only react to excessive temperature {{and not to}} excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge protector thermal fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded.|$|R
50|$|Some {{electronic}} components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as <b>thermal</b> fuses, circuit <b>breakers,</b> or PTC current limiters.|$|R
40|$|On {{up-to-date}} aircrafts {{the electric}} power system {{is a very complex}} and crucial system, since great part of the equipment requires power supply. Its protection is a critical task as a fault may be catastrophic if it is not quickly detected and isolated. <b>Thermal</b> magnetic <b>breakers</b> or fuses are commonly employed to provide overload and short circuit protection. Unfortunately they are not effective in detecting other dangerous faults such as electrical arcs. In the last decades many systems able to detect series and parallel arcs have been developed. Most of them are complex devices that involve custom hardware and high computational burden. In this paper the authors propose a method for the identification of the series arcs in DC power systems which is based on a simple analysis of the current signal and on the evaluation of the energy related to the arc itself. In the paper the developed technique and the related experimental results are presented...|$|R
25|$|<b>Thermal</b> {{magnetic}} circuit <b>breakers,</b> {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.|$|R
