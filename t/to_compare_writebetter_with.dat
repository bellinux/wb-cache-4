For normally distributed outcomes (e.g. CCQ and SGRQ scores), paired t-test was applied <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> week 26 (week 14 / week 2) to baseline for the two arms, respectively. Also 2 -sample independent t-test is used <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the two arms at baseline, and <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the changes of week 26 (week 14 / week 2) from baseline in the two arms. For outcomes which failed the normality test (e.g. BODE score), Wilcoxon signed ranks test is applied <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> week 26 (week 14 / week 2) to baseline for the two arms, respectively. Also Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney test is used <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the two arms at baseline, and <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the changes of week 26 (week 14 /week 2) from baseline in the two arms. Fisher's exact test is applied <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> the exacerbation frequencies of the two arms. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.
