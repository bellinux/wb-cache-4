5|$|Despite the canonic {{status of}} Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin is often {{characterized}} as an under-recognized {{or even as}} a forgotten author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) {{over the last few}} decades, he is much less well known by the reading public than other representatives of German modernism such as <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann,</b> Bertolt Brecht, or Franz Kafka.|$|E
5|$|Project X is a 2012 American comedy film {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and written by Michael Bacall and Matt Drake {{based on a}} story by Bacall, and produced by director Todd Phillips. The film follows three friends—Thomas (<b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann),</b> Costa (Oliver Cooper) and J.B. (Jonathan Daniel Brown)—who plan to gain popularity by throwing a party, a plan which quickly escalates out of their control.|$|E
5|$|Döblin {{completed}} work on November 1918 in {{the spring}} of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less oppressed by material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann.</b> In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann,</b> Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, aged 62, he {{was again}} uprooted by the German {{invasion}} of France, and spent {{weeks in a}} refugee camp in Mende. During this time he began attending mass at the cathedral in Mende, a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year. On 3 September 1940 Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded the Nea Hellas in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for 100 dollars a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann</b> and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.|$|E

5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann.</b> Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not feel at home in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E
5|$|When the University of Berlin awarded {{an honorary}} degree in 1934 to American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School Roscoe Pound, who had toured Germany earlier {{that year and}} {{made no secret of}} his admiration for the Nazi regime, Conant refused to order Pound not to accept it, and {{attended}} the informal award ceremony at Harvard where Pound was presented with the degree by Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States. While Conant declined to participate in the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars, Harvard awarded honorary degrees to two notable displaced scholars, <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann</b> and Albert Einstein, in 1935. What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble, despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor. It was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.|$|E
5|$|Andrić {{was an avid}} {{reader in}} his youth. The young Andrić's {{literary}} interests varied greatly, ranging from the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke and <b>Thomas</b> <b>Mann,</b> French writers Michel de Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant, and British writers Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad. Andrić also read the works of Miguel de Cervantes, Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi, Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, the American writers Walt Whitman and Henry James, and Czechoslovak philosopher Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Andrić was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karadžić, Njegoš, Kočić and Aleksa Šantić. Andrić also admired the Slovene poets Fran Levstik, Josip Murn and Oton Župančič, and translated some of their works. Kafka appears {{to have had a}} significant influence on Andrić's prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. At one point in his youth, Andrić even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature, which he read as French- and German-language translations.|$|E
