5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine the validity of <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing {{his feet on the}} top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of food addiction has increased substantially since {{the inclusion of}} gambling disorder in the DSM- 5.

Specifically possible aetiologies of food addiction, eating addiction and food addiction as an eating disorder are reviewed and the potential DSM- 5 classification espoused.

5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain <b>the</b> <b>phenomena)</b> were often unfounded.

The next chapter deals with Heidegger’s hermeneutic phenomenology as implicated in his compelling and as of yet unsurpassed analysis of <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of boredom. Through approaching <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of boredom via Husserl and Heidegger, the basic discontinuity between Husserl’s transcendental and Heidegger’s hermeneutic phenomenology comes clearly to the fore...|$|R

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to complex structures and systems, among <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are consciousness, hominid intelligence, instincts, emotions, metamorphosis, photosynthesis, homosexuality, music, language, religion, morality, and altruism (see altruism in animals). Most of these, such as hominid intelligence, instinct, emotion, photosynthesis, language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to examine to which extent there is {{scientific}} arguments for <b>the</b> social <b>phenomenon</b> organic production, and what importance this has for <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> This is examined through a literature study {{of the history of}} organic production, an analysis of the law of organic production with focus on the subjects; animal welfare and the prohibition on GMO, and finally a study on the consumers’ understanding of <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> <b>The</b> results from the literature study will lastly be discussed based on theories of Anthony Giddens, Peter Berger, and Thomas Luckmann regarding how the relationship between society and the individual mutually influence each other and thereby create social spaces in which phenomena have a meaning.

5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly.

However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies.

5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at <b>the</b> <b>phenomena,</b> such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E
5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E
5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E
50|$|Goldstein {{developed}} an approach where a situation or phenomenon is analyzed holistically, {{rather than simply}} looking at an isolated event.
