5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E

25|$|While the {{conception}} of human agency is often confined to its exercise by individuals, Albert Bandura has argued that individuals often do not have direct control over social conditions or institutional practices <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> lives; in these circumstances, well-being and security are sought through exercise of proxy agency. For instance, individuals in such circumstances may attempt to persuade others who have expertise, influence, or power to act on their behalf to achieve the outcomes they desire.|$|E

25|$|The UCS {{explained}} that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid (PHEV) {{was not included in}} the evaluation even though the Volt could have been compared with the Chevrolet Cruze as the conventional similar. The reason for the exclusion is that PHEVs are affected by a variety of factors <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> environmental performance, such as the type of fuel used (coal, wind, solar, etc.) for generating electricity to charge the vehicle, and also by the driving habits, including how often the vehicle is plugged in and the number of miles driven on electricity-only mode.|$|E

The Davenport Development International Men's Day Football Tournament took place on Saturday, 22 November 2014 at the Camana Bay Sports Complex, and Premier Alden McLaughlin delivered an International Men's Day Message.

25|$|Several {{different}} types of light sources exist, each having different properties <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> appropriateness for certain tasks, particularly efficiency and spectral power distribution. It {{is often the case}} that inappropriate light sources have been selected for a task, either due to ignorance or because more sophisticated light sources were unavailable at the time of installation. Therefore, badly chosen light sources often contribute unnecessarily to light pollution and energy waste. By re-assessing and changing the light sources used, it is often possible to reduce energy use and pollutive effects while simultaneously greatly improving efficiency and visibility.|$|E
25|$|These “pueblos” govern much {{of their}} local affairs through “usos y costumbres,” modern legal {{recognition}} of the old village governing structures still in place, many of which use some form of direct democracy. This is {{in stark contrast to}} areas such as Villa Coapa, where almost all local decisions are made by representatives. Because of the rugged terrain, few roads and little police protection, these settlements are isolated. While protected from some of crime problems <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> urban counterparts, this isolation has made the area attractive for drug runners bringing their merchandise into Mexico City, for kidnappers, illegal logging and more, which has led to a number of murders in the area.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{place in}} a magical world that loosely {{operates}} {{by the rules of}} the 3.5 edition of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons (D), the comic follows the sometimes farcical exploits of six adventurers as they strive to save the world from an evil lich sorcerer. Much of the comic's humor stems from the characters' awareness of the game rules <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> lives or from having anachronistic knowledge of modern culture. This in turn is often used by the author to parody various aspects of role-playing games and fantasy fiction. While primarily comedic in nature, The Order of the Stick features a continuing storyline serialized in one-to four-page episodes, with over 1000 such episodes released so far.|$|E
