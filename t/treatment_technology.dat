25|$|Ash ponds, a type {{of surface}} impoundment, are a widely used <b>treatment</b> <b>technology</b> at {{coal-fired}} plants. These ponds use gravity to settle out large particulates (measured as total suspended solids) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, chemical precipitation, biological treatment (such as an activated sludge process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems. Technological advancements in ion exchange membranes and electrodialysis systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of flue-gas desulfurization wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits. The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.|$|E
25|$|Vapor {{condensation}} is {{the most}} effective off-gas <b>treatment</b> <b>technology</b> for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers. The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as cryogenic cooling and compression (C3-Technology).|$|E

40|$|Wastewater reuse is very {{important}} in water resource management for both environmental and economic reasons. Unfortunately, wastewater from textile industries is difficult to treat by convectional wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>technologies.</b> Now days, polluted water due to color from textile dyeing and finishing industries is burning issue for researchers. Textile or industrial wastewaters contain non-biodegradable organic compounds, which cannot be easily biodegraded because of their complex chemical structure. Dye wastewater discharged from textile wastewaters is one example of non-biodegradable organic compounds {{and it is difficult to}} remove dye effluent by convectional wastewater treatment methods. Therefore, this thesis deals about a review of advanced <b>treatment</b> <b>technologies,</b> which can de-colorize and remove non-biodegradable organic compounds from textile wastewater effluents. In addition to this, the potential and limitation of these advanced treatment methods are reviewed.
