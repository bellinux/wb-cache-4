50|$|In early 1943, {{stemming}} from problems found in North Africa, the Army began {{to consider a}} more defensive role for tank destroyer units. After trials in January, fifteen battalions were ordered to convert to towed guns on 31 March, and shortly thereafter {{it was decided that}} half of all tank destroyer units would convert to a towed organization. The broad outline of the battalion remained - three companies of three platoons of four guns - but the reconnaissance company was downgraded to two platoons in the headquarters company. However, the need for larger gun crews and more security troops meant that the manpower of the unit increased again. These units were equipped with 3-inch M5 guns towed by trucks or M3 Halftracks. However, combat experience in Normandy and Italy - coupled with the fact that purpose-built M18 and M36 tank destroyers were becoming available - showed that the <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> were underperforming compared with self-propelled ones. After the Ardennes campaign, where 85% of all tank destroyer losses were towed guns, it was decided to convert all <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> back to self-propelled guns.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral {{performance}} of heavy vehicle combinations, specifically longer combination vehicles, is discussed. The use of longer combination vehicles is promoted by their {{positive impact on}} the traffic congestion problem, as well as their economic and environmental benefits due to reduced fuel consumption and emissions. However, from a safety perspective, there are concerns about their impact on the traffic. In a heavy vehicle combination maneuvering at high speeds, lateral motions get amplified at the <b>towed</b> <b>units,</b> which causes trailer swing and large path deviation and side slip. These amplified motions are dangerous for any nearby cars as well as the vehicle combination itself and can lead to instability. The main goal of the research presented in this thesis is to develop control strategies for improving the lateral performance of heavy vehicle combinations at high speeds by suppression of amplified motions at the <b>towed</b> <b>units.</b> As a starting point, the heavy vehicle accidents are investigated and the relevant critical maneuvers are identified. Subsequently, the lateral performance of heavy vehicle combinations in the identified critical maneuvers is investigated by simulations to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} causes behind rearward amplification of motions in heavy vehicle combinations and to specify the control objectives. Accordingly, a generic controller for improving the lateral performance of heavy vehicle combinations by active steering of the <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> is developed. The developed controller is verified for various heavy vehicle combinations by simulation, with respect to the identified critical maneuvers. The verification results confirm the effectiveness of the controller and show significant reductions in yaw rates, side slip and path deviation of the <b>towed</b> <b>units</b> of the heavy vehicle combinations, up to 70 %. Additionally, the robustness of the controller is evaluated by extensive analysis of its performance in various driving conditions and presence of parameter uncertainties for a sample heavy vehicle combination. Furthermore, the controller is implemented on a truck-dolly-semitrailer test vehicle and verified in a series of single and double lane changes. The experimental results approve the simulation outcomes. The developed controller can be easily implemented on steerable trailers; since it utilizes common sensors for steering input, speed and yaw rates and does not require large computing capacity. The significant improvements obtained by the developed controller can promote the use of longer combination vehicles in traffic, which will result in a reduction of traffic congestion problem, as well as substantial environmental and economic benefits...|$|R

40|$|The {{three main}} {{requirements}} of a vehicle-trailer connection system are: en route stability, over- or under-steering restraint, minimum off-tracking along curved path. Linking the two units by four-bar trapeziums, wider stability margins may be attained {{in comparison with the}} conventional pintle-hitch for both instability types, divergent or oscillating. The stability maps are traced applying the Hurwitz method or the direct analysis of the characteristic equation at the instability threshold. Several types of four-bar linkages may be quickly tested, with the drawbars converging towards the trailer or the <b>towing</b> <b>unit.</b> The latter configuration appears preferable in terms of self-stability and may yield high critical speeds by optimising the geometrical and physical properties. Nevertheless, the system stability may be improved in general by additional vibration dampers in parallel with the connection linkage. Moreover, the four-bar connection may produce significant corrections of the under-steering or over-steering behaviour of the vehicle-train after a steering command from the driver. The offtracking along the curved paths may be also optimized or kept inside prefixed margins of acceptableness. Activating electronic stability systems if necessary, fair results are obtainable for both the steering conduct and the off-tracking...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} single-track models representing an A-double vehicle combination. The equations {{of motion}} are expressed relative the center of mass for the first vehicle unit and are derived using Lagrangian formalism. The symbolic manipulations of the equations have been done using the software Mathematica. The model derived in this report {{is intended to be}} valid for studies of vehicle cornering in high speed with moderate lateral and longitudinal acceleration levels. In order to keep the model complexity as low as possible, the derived {{equations of motion}} are simplified. The steering angle and the articulation angles of the towed vehicle units are assumed to be small. All products of the steering angle, the yaw rate of the first unit and the articulation angles and their time derivatives are set to zero. Further, the representation of longitudinal vehicle velocity leads to different level of model complexity. Firstly, the longitudinal velocity is assumed to be constant. Together {{with the use of a}} linear lateral tyre model this results in a fully linear vehicle model, consisting of eight states and one input. Secondly, the longitudinal velocity is allowed to be varying and is represented as a model state variable. Also here a linear lateral tyre model is used. The resulting vehicle model becomes non-linear, consisting of nine states and six inputs. Further simplifications of the longitudinal dynamics is carried out by assuming e. g. slowly varying longitudinal velocity and longitudinal forces only on the <b>towing</b> <b>unit.</b> This results in a non-linear model consisting of nine states and two inputs. This model is to be compared with the fully linear model. Realistic linear tyre parameters are found by tuning the derived linear single-track model with results from a high fidelity vehicle model developed at Volvo Group Trucks Technology (VGTT). The tuning was made using the software Matlab and a built-in Genetic Algorithm(GA), where the summarized squared difference in yaw rate gain for vehicle units was minimized. The performance of the derived vehicle model, including the difference in treatment of the longitudinal velocity, is evaluated in a comparison with the high fidelity model developed at VGTT. The open-loop analysis carried out in the comparison are step steer response analysis, single-sine steer response analysis, braking in a turn analysis (ISO 14794) ...|$|E
