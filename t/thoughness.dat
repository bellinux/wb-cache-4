40|$|The {{influence}} {{of water on}} the fracture of magnesium aluminate (MgAl 2 O 4) ceramics and spinel single crystals is investigated in order to determine whether adsorption plays an important role during subcritical crack growth as it does for MnZn ferrites, a compound with the same spinel structure. The fracture <b>thoughness</b> of porous and dense polycrystalline ceramic and single crystal specimens are determined using a single edge notched beam setup at different crosshead velocities and humidities. Furthermore, in order to investigate whether a preferred plane of fracture is present, electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) has been performed. It is found that the fracture <b>thoughness</b> decreases with increasing humidity for dense ceramics, indicating that adsorption plays an important role as it does for MnZn ferrites. However, porous ceramics only show a sharop decrease between 0 % and 2 - 10 % relative humidity (RH) and hardly decreases onwards. This implies that the pores inhibit in some way the effect of adsorption during fracture. The exact mechanism remains unclear. EBSD measurements indicated that a preferred plane is absent. Therefore, the fracture of spinel single crystal along the (100) and (111) planes was chosen for further detailed investigation. It is revealed that between 2 % and 40 % RH both planes show a reduction in fracture surface energy of ~ 46 %. Using reported computer simulations results, it can be concluded that the surfaces are partially hydrated when being fractured...|$|E

40|$|Cantala (Agave cantala), plant of {{the family}} Asparagaceae and its fibers, belongs to the leaf fibers group. These fibers are made into coarse twines at about 1. 2 mm in diameter. The yarns of the cantala fiber are then {{interwoven}} to create textile reinforcements at two meshing size i. e. 5 x 20 mm and 10 x 20 mm. The textiles are used to reinforce polymer modified mortars to improve flexural properties of the mortars. This research aims to investigate the effect of textile reinforcement made from cantala fiber on the flexural behaviour of polymer modified mortar especially its strain hardening response. The parameters to be observed include strength, stiffness, <b>thoughness,</b> ductility and residual strength. The effect of the meshing size of the textile reinforcement on those properties are assesed. In addition, {{the efficacy of the}} cantala fiber textile reinforcement to improve the flexural properties of polymer modified mortar is compared with textile reinforcement made from wire mesh. The results indicate that an inclusion of short fibers could alter the post-peak behaviour of the mortar from brittle to ductile failure with softening response. Futher reinforcement of this mortar with cantala fiber textile would turn the softening response to a strain hardening response. The presence of cantala fiber textile reinforcement has minor effect on the flexural strength and stiffness. However, it significantly improve the <b>thoughness,</b> ductility and residual strength of the mortar. Cantala fiber textile reinforcement with a meshing size of 5 x 20 mm gives a greater increase on those post-peak properties compared to the the one with a meshing size of 10 x 20 mm. When comparison is made to the wire mesh, both cantala fiber textile reinforcements show a better properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{applying}} the common agency framework to {{the context of}} an oligopolistic industry, we want to go beyond the classical dichotomy between Cournot and Bertrand competition. We define two games, the oligopolistic game and the corresponding concept of oligopolistic equilibrium, and an associated auxiliary game that can be interpreted as a common agency game and that has the same set of equilibria. The parameterization of the set of (potential) equilibria in terms of competitive <b>thoughness</b> is derived from the first order conditions of the auxiliary game. The enforceability of monopolistic competition, of price and quantity competition, and of collusion is examined in this framework. We then describe the (reduced) set of equilibria one would obtain, first in the non-intrinsic case and then in the case where a global approach would be adopted instead of partial equilibrium approach. Finally, we illustrate the use of the concept of oligopolistic equilibrium and of the corresponding parameterization by referring to the standard case of symmetric quadratic utility. ...|$|E

This paper describes investigations for the nondestructive characterization of microstructural changes of the metastable austenitic steel X 6 CrNiTi 18 10 (AISI 321). Due to its good mechanical and technological properties, i. e. high <b>thoughness</b> and corrosion resistance, AISI 321 is widely used in the chemical industry and power pland constructions. Experiments were carried out on sample batches fatigued at room temperature and T= 300 deg C.

That is characterized by cyclic hardening and softeting effects, wich are strongly influenced by placticity-induced martensite formation.

Six different specimen groups of ductile iron alloyed with various amounts of nickel and copper were subjected to machining tests and their machinabilities were investigated based on cutting forces and surface roughness criteria. The results were evaluated according to microstructure and mechanical properties of specimens determined before.

40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of semibrittle {{materials such as}} bcc transition metals or semiconductor crystals strongly depends on loading rate and temperature. If crack-tip pasticity {{is considered to be}} thermally activated, a strong correlation between these quantities is expected. An Arrthenius-like scaling relation between the loading rate and the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature has already been reported. In the present work, two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of crack-tip plasticity are employed to show that the different combinations of loading rates and termperatures which yield the same {{fracture toughness}} are indeed correlated by a scaling relation. This scaling relation is closely related to the law used to describe dislocation motion. A strong correlation between loading rate and temperature is found in the entiere temperature regime in which crack-tip plasticity is controlled by dislocation mobility. This shows the importance of dislocation mobility for fracture <b>thoughness</b> below the brittle-to-ductile transition and for the transition itself. The findings of our simulations are consistent with experimental data gathered on tungsten single crystals and suggest that non-screw dislocations are dominating crack-tip plasticity in the semibrittle regime of this material...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} toughness of transition metals or semiconductor crystals strongly depends on loading rate and temperature {{in such a}} way that the {{fracture toughness}} increases with temperature or with decreasing loading rate. For a given loading rate a more or less well-defined termperature exists where the material undergoes a transition from brittle to ductile behavior. In our investigations we employed the two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics method to study the semi-brittle regime, where a plastic region around the crack tip starts to develop, but cannot shield the crack completely. Thus, in this regime the material still falls by final fracture. Based on gernal findings of the numerical simulations an Arrhenius-like relation between loading rate and temperature at points of constant fracture <b>thoughness</b> is derived. This scaling relation shows the dominance of dislocation mobility as rate limiting factor for fracture toughness and for the brittle-to-ductile transition itself. The results of our simulations are also consistent with experimental data gathered on tungsten single crystals. Thus, the proposed scaling relation can be used to predict fracture toughnesses in a wide range of temperatures and loading rates, based on only a small number of experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvements}} {{of performances}} of turbojets {{in terms of}} thrust and reliability are strongly affected by {{the design of the}} turbine hi-pressure stages, and in particular by the maximum gas temperature at inlet. In order to increase the working temperatures and to extend the time between inspection and/or substitution of the relevant components, the research must be focussed on materials with high thermo-mechanical properties. The principal requirement for ceramic TBC being the resistance to repeated thermal cycles during operation while assuring the protection of substrate against heat, fragile behaviour of traditional ceramics is a critical issue [1 - 3]. One of the possible solutions to the aforementioned problem can be the adoption of nanostructured materials, that at least theoretically provide higher fracture <b>thoughness</b> and thermal shock resistance than traditional ones. As thermal spraying is the most efficient and economical deposition technique for thermal barrier coatings [4 - 5], it appears sensible to investigate the possibility of using it for the fabrication of nanostructured thermal barrier coatings, due to the very short residence time of starting materials at high temperature. A careful selection of process parameters is necessary for preventing the shortcomings correlated to the risk of grain coarsening and phase changing [6 - 7]. In the present communication, preliminary results concerning the characterization of zirconia-yttria APS nanostructured coatings (obtained by deposition of commercially available nanostructured powders) as well as a comparison with the performances of conventional microstructured coatings are presented...|$|E

Fifteen days after surgery SO and SS groups were subjected to a ST (60 min/day, 5 days/week, overload of 3 % of BW) for 10 weeks. Alkalin phosfatase was reduced in OVX as compared to SHAM (18, 87 pg/mL vs. 53, 93 pg/mL, respectively), but not altered by ST. Animals SHAM showed more cancellous bone than OVX (255, 50 +/- 38, 27 vs 288, 75 +/- 39, 63 points, respectively). Exercised animals exhibited more cancellous bone than controls (292, 00 +/- 33, 54 vs 251, 54 +/- 38, 99 points, respectively) in this region and in the grater trochanter (281, 50 +/- 34, 42 vs 237, 23 +/- 53, 03 points; respectively). Bone mineral density and cortical bone in the femur midshaft were not altered either by OVX or ST. The maximum force and <b>thoughness</b> of the femoral neck and midshaft were not affected either by OVX or ST. It was concluded that ST benefits cancellous bone mass in the femoral proximal region (i. e. femoral neck and greater trochanter), independently of ovariectomy, which did not reflect in improved mechanical properties either in the femoral neck or midshaft...|$|E
40|$|The CTOD {{toughness}} {{evaluation of}} repaired weld joints (given two weld deposits, complex mechanical heterogeneity and high residual stresses) requires modification of commonly used specimen geometry and testing procedure. This paper {{presents the results}} of the SENB specimens with shallow (a/W= 0. 16) and deep notches (a/W= 0. 5) extracted from 30 mm thick multipass submerged arc welded (SAW) joints which were repaired with hyperbaric (16 bar) welding process at the toe region of the original SAW weld deposit. The results of this study show that the CTOD (#delta#_ 5) measurements are consistent with the calculated CTOD values according to the BS 5762 standard for both deep and shallow cracked specimens (a/W= 0. 16) if the plastic rotation factor (r_p) value of 0. 25 is used in the latter. The problem of selection of yield stress for calculation of the CTOD according to the BS 5762 standard for highly heterogeneous repaired weld joints can be eliminated using the CTOD (#delta#_ 5) technique. It is important to realise that the through thickness deep and shallow notched specimens can produce lower bound toughness values if the notch accurately samples the local brittle zones. The later produced its lower bound values under the influence of overmatching hyperbaric repair weld joint despite its lower crack tip constraint. Surface notched specimens (a/W= 0. 4) where the very crack tip is controlled by one microstructure did not give lower bound <b>thoughness</b> values. (orig.)

40|$|The {{deformation}} and toughness of amorphous glassy polymers {{is discussed}} in terms of both the molecular network structure and the microscopic structure. Two model systems were taken into consideration: polystyrene-poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene ether) blends (PS-PPE) and epoxides based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). The network structure of the thermoplastic PS-PPE system could be varied systematically by changing the relative volume fractions of PS (low entanglement density, v e= 3 × 1025 chains m- 3) and PPE (v e= 13 × 10 s 25 chains m- 3) in this miscible blend. The crosslink density, v c, of the DGEBA system could be set by selecting various epoxide monomer molecular weights (8 × 1025 ¿ v c ¿ 235 × 1025 chains m- 3). The microscopic structure at length scales of 50 – 300 nm was controlled by the addition of different amounts of non-adhering core-shell-rubber particles having a constant diameter. <b>Thoughness</b> is mainly determined by the maximum macroscopic draw ratio since the yield stress of most polymers approximately is identical (50 – 80 MPa). It is shown, based on the analysis of experimental data published in literature, that the theoretical maximum draw ratio, derived from the maximum (entanglement or crosslink) network deformation, is obtained macroscopically when the characteristic length scale of the microstructure of the material is below a certain value, i. e., the critical matrix ligament thickness between added nonadhering rubbery particles (`holes`). The value of the critical matrix ligament thickness (IDc) uniquely depends on the network structure: at an increasing network density, IDc increases independent {{of the nature of the}} network structure (entanglements or crosslinks).

40|$|Cartilage {{has limited}} {{potential}} for self repair. Therefore, articular cartilage lesions {{often lead to}} early osteoarthritis. Early clinical results of cartilage replacement procedures such as autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) seem promising, but long term results are not available to date. Only longitudinal studies of 20 years and more will show whether the cartilage repair procedures currently in evaluation will prevent the treated patients from developing early osteoarthritis and if the progression of osteoarthritis will be halted. In {{order to be able}} to evaluate and compare different methods of cartilage treatment, a thorough understanding of the mechanical properties of intact cartilage and cartilage with early degenerations is needed. The prime function of cartilage is load bearing. Cartilage absorbs and spreads the applied energy thereby protecting the underlying bone. It also provides diarthrodial joints with an almost frictionless gliding surface. It has been shown in clinic that there is a correlation between the histological quality, the load bearing capacity and the durability of the repair. Thus it seems logical to search for a repair with properties close to that of normal cartilage. The mechanical behaviour of cartilage is complex, since the tissue structure is a combination of partly porous, viscous and elastic components. This results in deformation rate-dependent stiffness, i. e. how much energy is needed to deform the cartilage (dynamic modulus) and energy dissipation (loss angle) properties. The water movement through or out of the cartilage under a given loading condition makes its response to loading more complex compared to an ordinary viscoelastic solid. To determine these properties, several tests can be performed, i. e. unconfined or confined compression, or indentation tests. In this thesis, dynamic indentation tests were performed because indentation minimizes specimen preparation and has been shown by others to produce meaningful cartilage stiffness data. However, a mathematical model is needed to calculate stiffness data out of those experiments. These models are always a simplification of the real situation, since cartilage is a complex structure with complex mechanical properties. To determine the influence of the mathematical model used on the results the conventional model (Hayes) is compared with a novel method (Kren) in chapter 2, which has as a main advantage that it does not assume linear elasticity. Although a difference was found in absolute values calculated with these models, the trends they show were similar when used to evaluate the same set of data. Thus experimental data cannot be compared between these different models, but for comparisons within one model, both models give similar results. In order to determine cartilage behaviour, preferably healthy human specimens are tested. Unfortunately, these specimens were extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore in chapter 3, we investigated whether swine cartilage could serve as a model for human cartilage for mechanical testing. At equivalent anatomic locations, dynamic modulus was similar for human and swine specimens, but a small difference was found in the loss angle. Keeping these differences in mind, swine specimens can be used for ex-vivo testing. Since mechanical behaviour of cartilage depends on the applied deformation rate and inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity, in chapter 3 the behaviour of cartilage in swine knee joints was determined as a function of loading mode and anatomic location. We observed a larger heterogenity at fast compared to slow deformation rates. Moreover, no differences were found in the loss angle at slow deformation rate between locations. These differences highlight the need for using multiple test modes, i. e. loading cartilage at different strain rates. After expanding the knowledge of dynamic stiffness properties of cartilage, in chapter 4 and 5 we explored whether double network hydrogels (DN-gels) are suitable as a cartilage repair material. It already has been shown by others that these DN-gels look promising to serve as a cartilage repair material because of its low sliding friction, high wear resistancy, high <b>thoughness</b> and biocompatibility. Current focal repairs have a much lower initial stiffness and strength than the surrounding tissue, which increases early failure potential. In chapter 4, we tested the mechanical properties related to surgical use of two kinds of DN-gels. Both DN-gels showed good suture tear-out strength and also pull-off tests with tissue adhesive showed promising results. However, dynamic stiffness of both DN-gels was only about 10...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: O concreto reforçado com fibras de aço (CRFA) tem seu {{principal}} campo de aplicação nos pisos industriais e pavimentos. Em função das características de redistribuição de esforços que apresentam tais estruturas - placas apoiadas sobre uma base elástica - é possível a substituição total das armaduras convencionais pelas fibras de aço, acelerando o processo executivo e garantindo sua segurança e durabilidade. A introdução das fibras de aço nos concretos tem como principal função modificar o comportamento do compósito quando solicitado a esforços de flexão, transformando um material de natureza frágil em dúctil, ou seja, com capacidade de absorção de energia. A ductilidade desse compósito é usualmente quantificada pela medida de tenacidade do material em ensaios de tração na flexão, obtida com velocidade de deformação controlada, condição fundamental para avaliação do comportamento do compósito após sua fissuração. É importante salientar que a tenacidade do CRFA é fortemente influenciada pela distribuição das fibras na matriz de concreto, distribuição esta que é sensivelmente diferente em corpos de prova prismáticos moldados, utilizados para o controle de qualidade da obra, do que a encontrada nas estruturas dos pisos ou pavimentos. As propriedades do CRFA são expressas assumindo essa distribuição randomizada das fibras. Não obstante, em corpos de prova de tamanhos padronizados, ocorrem os efeitos de parede, também chamados de efeitos de borda. Esses efeitos consistem no alinhamento das fibras junto ao fundo e às laterais do corpo de prova, tornando o arranjo das fibras de aço nesses locais comprometido em virtude desses efeitos de parede. Com isto ocorre um aumento induzido no desempenho do compósito dado o alinhamento das fibras à direção principal de tensão durante a flexão. Buscando analisar a influência que a distribuição das fibras tem sobre a tenacidade do material, foram moldadas placas com dimensões que simulem os pisos e pavimentos (com três distintos teores de fibras: 20, 30 e 40 kg/m³), das quais foram extraídos prismas para determinação da suas tenacidades, que serão comparadas com as obtidas em prismas moldados. Os resultados foram cotejados estatisticamente, através da análise de variância, para estabelecimento das correlações existentes e suas influências sobre a tenacidade do compósito. Não há norma nacional para ensaios e utilização do CRFA que especifiquem e normatizem o seu uso. Dessa maneira, em virtude dos resultados dos valores de tenacidade terem sido com grande variabilidade, propusemos valores característicos para serem utilizados no controle executivo de obra. ABSTRACT: The {{steel fiber}} reinforced concrete (SFRC) {{has in the}} industrial slabs-on-ground and the pavements its main field of application. Regarding the features of such structures and the redistribution of the resulting forces - slabs supported on elastic base - the complete substitution of the conventional armors for steel fibers has been possible saving time of the executive process, nevertheless security and durability also guaranteed. The introduction of steel fibers in the concrete has the mainly feature of modifying {{the behavior of the}} composite when requested the flexural efforts, transforming a material of fragile nature into ductile, which means; with capacity of energy absorption. The ductility of this composite usually is quantified by the measurement of the <b>thoughness</b> of the material in tensile stress in the flexural tests, obtained by controlled speed deformation, basic condition for evaluation of the behavior of the composite afterwards fissuration. It is {{important to point out that}} the toughness of the SFRC is mainly influenced by the distribution of fibers in the concrete matrix, distribution that is significantly different in prismatic specimen molded, used for the control of the quality of the construction, of what found in the structures of the slabs-on-ground and the pavements. The properties of the SFRC are express assuming this randomly distribution of the fibers. However, in specimen of standard sizes the wall effect occurs, also calls of edge effect. These effects consist in the alignment of the fibers next to botton and to the laterals of the specimen. This occurs with an induced increase in the performance of the composite given the alignment of fibers on the main direction of tension during flexion. In this way, an induced increase in the performance of the composite given the alignment of staple fibers to the main direction of tension occurs during the flexural test, becoming the arrangement of steel fibers in these places compromised due to these wall effects. Searching to analyze the influence that the distribution of staple fibers has on the toughness of the material, plates with dimensions were molded that simulate the slabs-onground and pavements (with three distinct staple fiber texts: 20, 30 and 40 kg/m³), of which prisms for determination of its toughness will be extracted, that will be compared with the gotten ones in molded specimen. The results will be statistically analyzed through the analysis of variance for establishment of the existing correlations and its influences on the toughness of the composite. There is no national standard for testing and use of the SFRC that specify and regulate their use. Thus, given the results of toughness values have been with great variability, we propose characteristic values for the application in executive control of building works...|$|E
