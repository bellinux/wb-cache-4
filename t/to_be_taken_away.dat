5|$|Fowley {{arrives and}} {{forcibly}} takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a CDC facility at Fort Marlene. There, Mulder runs into Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Marita tells Mulder {{that she was}} subjected to Syndicate-run black oil vaccine tests. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a checkpoint, preparing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra; Cigarette Smoking Man and Fowley escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E
5|$|Bosniak {{scholars}} {{object to}} the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andrić's works. During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him of everything from plagiarism to being a Serb nationalist, and made remarks insinuating that he was homosexual. Some {{went so far as}} to call for his Nobel Prize <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away.</b> Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately before the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with a sledgehammer. Twenty years later, in 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town called Andrićgrad, sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska. Andrićgrad was officially inaugurated in June 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully {{have been replaced by}} Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals. Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra—save The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

25|$|After {{waging a}} {{tremendous}} qualifying battle with Schumacher on Saturday and securing a front-row starting position, Häkkinen dug himself a hole {{on a cool}} but sunny race day: first, he slid off the track into the guardrail {{at the end of}} the infield straight in the morning warm-up, damaging his McLaren's suspension and requiring a heroic job by his crew to get the car ready to race. Three hours later, he learned that his failure to wait for the green light to begin the warm-up session had caused his best qualifying lap <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away,</b> dropping him from second to fourth position on the grid.|$|E
25|$|In 1691, Louvois {{instructed}} his marshals {{to destroy}} those towns which were {{to serve as}} winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river {{under the command of}} Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges at Philippsburg on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves' residential town of Durlach and 1,200 cavalry men, 300 dragoons and 1,200 infantry men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not much left <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away).</b> On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.|$|E

500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away,</b> and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury drain away until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|As Lois prepares dinner, Stewie {{puts the}} final touches on his mind-control device, only for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from him by Lois, who won't allow 'toys' at the table.

Unfortunately, Peter forgets his promise to Lois and plays such drinking games as [...] "Drink the beer". He goes to {{work the next day}} with a hangover, and falls asleep on the job as a safety inspector in a toy factory. Peter misses dangerous objects such as a butcher knife, a surge protector, a gasoline can, razor blades, a porcupine, a toaster with forks inside and a plug in water. The company receives bad press after releasing unsafe toy products, and Peter is promptly fired by Mr. Weed.|$|E

500|$|The area {{of north}} Staffordshire {{known today as}} the City of Stoke-on-Trent was already a {{thriving}} industrial area {{before the arrival of}} the railways. [...] The establishment of the pottery industry and the development of coal and ironstone mines in the 18th century had provided a need for materials, most noticeably clay, to be brought into the area. A corresponding need also arose for the resulting fragile goods i.e. pottery <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> from the area. This need had given rise in the mid to late 18th century of the construction of the Trent & Mersey Canal (T) and its various branches. Opened in 1777 it was a spectacular success and paid dividends reaching 75% in 1822. [...] By 1845 this had fallen to a still impressive 30% despite the onset of railway development in the North West of England. In 1836 the canal carried [...] of goods away and brought in [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{motif of}} the funerary {{art of the}} 7th and 6th centuriesBCE was {{typically}} a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives {{for use in the}} afterlife. From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones, often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as Charun or the winged female Vanth. The underworld figures are sometimes depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away.</b> The handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living. This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the [...] "handshake took place {{at the other end of}} the journey, and represents the dead being greeted in the Underworld".|$|E
500|$|An early {{draft of}} the script {{attributed}} to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house {{in the guise of}} Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish for her brother <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this {{draft of the}} script, and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would [...] "much rather have a Queen" [...] than [...] "a little goblin prince." [...] The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, her blows causing him to transform into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas in the film she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas in the film there is none (although there is in the novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualized.|$|E

500|$|Ouster clauses {{are related}} to another {{administrative}} law concept: jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. Traditionally, at common law, an ouster clause precludes a court from interfering with a decision made by a public authority which was acting within its jurisdiction, but committed a non-jurisdictional error of law. However, the clause is not effective in preventing judicial review of errors of law that affect {{the jurisdiction of the}} authority to make the decision. For instance, in R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Gilmore (1957), Lord Justice of Appeal Alfred Denning said that it was [...] "well settled that the remedy by certiorari is never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> by any statute except by the most clear and explicit words. The word 'final' is not enough." [...] The effect of such a clause is to make [...] "the decision final on the facts, but not final on the law. Notwithstanding that the decision is by a statute made 'final,' certiorari can still issue for excess of jurisdiction or for error of law {{on the face of the}} record." [...] However, in the light of developments in the law, such a differentiation may no longer be applicable depending on the judicial school of thought employed.|$|E

2500|$|For Ridley, {{on matters}} of indifference, one must defer {{conscience}} to the authorities of the church, or else [...] "thou showest thyself a disordered person, disobedient, as [...] contemner of lawful authority, and a wounder of thy weak brother his conscience." [...] For him, the debate was finally about legitimate authority, not the merits and demerits of vestments themselves. He contended {{that it is only}} accidental that the compulsory ceases to be indifferent; the degeneration of a practice into non-indifference can be corrected without throwing out the practice.

King's birth occurred as his father was speaking {{to members of the}} Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and he announced his son's name after being told of the birth.

2500|$|As {{a result}} of a solar eclipse and the superstitions {{surrounding}} it, Jaguar Paw and the remaining captives are spared from being sacrificed by beheading. Instead, they are ordered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>away</b> and [...] "disposed of". They are offered freedom if they can avoid being killed during target practice by Zero Wolf and his men. After some tribesmen are killed, Jaguar Paw is severely injured but kills Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock (Ricardo Díaz Mendoza) and escapes into the jungle. Zero Wolf sets off with eight comrades to chase down and kill Jaguar Paw. Back in his native jungle, Jaguar Paw now has the advantage, although he is badly injured. Most of his pursuers - including Zero Wolf and Middle Eye - are gradually killed off via clever conceits and traps laid out by Jaguar Paw until there are only two left to hunt him.|$|E
