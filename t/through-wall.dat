50|$|The basic RFT probe {{consists}} of an exciter coil (also known as a transmit or send coil) which sends {{a signal to the}} detector (or receive coil). The exciter coil is pumped with an AC current and emits a magnetic field. The field travels outwards from the exciter coil, through the pipe wall, and along the pipe. The detector is placed inside the pipe two to three pipe diameters away from the exciter and detects the magnetic field that has travelled back in from the outside of the pipe wall (for a total of two <b>through-wall</b> transits). In areas of metal loss, the field arrives at the detector with a faster travel time (greater phase) and greater signal strength (amplitude) due to the reduced path through the steel. Hence the dominant mechanism of RFT is through-transmission.|$|E

40|$|Impulse <b>through-wall</b> radar (TWR) is {{considered}} as one of preferred choices for <b>through-wall</b> human indication due to its good penetration and high range resolution. Large bandwidth available for impulse TWR results in high range resolution, but also brings an atypical adversity issue not substantial in narrowband radars — high timing jitter effect, caused by the non-ideal sampling clock at the receiver. The fact that impulse TWR employs very narrow pulses makes little jitter inaccuracy large enough to destroy the signal correlation property and then degrade clutter suppression performance. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} timing jitter impact on clutter suppression in <b>through-wall</b> human indication via impulse TWR. We setup a simple timing jitter model and propose a criterion namely average range profile (ARP) contrast is to evaluate the jitter level. To combat timing jitter, we also develop an effective compensation method based on local ARP contrast maximization. The proposed method can be implemented pulse by pulse followed by exponential average background subtraction algorithm to mitigate clutters. <b>Through-wall</b> experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can dramatically improve <b>through-wall</b> human indication performance...|$|E

30|$|<b>Through-wall</b> human {{detection}} {{is a new}} {{developing technology}} in recent years. It can penetrate non-metallic media (such as brick wall, ruins) to detect life signal in far-off areas but does not require any contact with the living body through electrodes or sensors [1 – 5]. <b>Through-wall</b> human detection is of great interest for many applications, such as military reconnaissance, anti-terrorism, and medical and natural disaster ambulance.

In [1], an efficient method of TOA estimation using UWB <b>through-wall</b> radar is proposed to detect and track moving target behind wall based on TWRI algorithm. In [2], a multi-channel <b>through-wall</b> radar imaging based on image fusion for combining the single-channel images to obtain a high signal-to-clutter ratio image was proposed for <b>through-wall</b> human being detection. In [3], a signal processing strategy was proposed to track multiple extended targets in a scene {{by means of a}} wide-band monostatic <b>through-wall</b> radar.

In [5], a novel near-field <b>through-wall</b> imaging algorithm with ability in the presence of wall ambiguities was proposed, and the capability of the new algorithm to detect the targets was verified by finite-difference time-domain method. In [6], an extension iterative target detector and another detector based on Bayes’ test were proposed with joint detection and fusion of a set of multipolarization radar images. In [7], a compressive sensing-based through-the-wall imaging algorithm was presented, and the algorithm performance was analyzed with respect to the total number of measurements for different sparsity levels and for varying SNR levels.|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of buried piping, {{resistance}} of the pipe-soil system to the applied vertical load is a significant design consideration. Application of a resultant vertical load perpendicular to the longitudinal pipe axis results in ovalization of the pipe, with resulting vertical pressures in the soil bedding and horizontal pressures in the soil backfill adjacent to the pipe, as well as internal forces and moments in the pipe wall. For pipes that are relatively rigid compared to the soil backfill, the developed internal forces in the pipe hoop and resulting internal moments in the wall tend {{to be higher than}} a more flexible pipe with a stiffer soil backfill. For many buried pipes, design to consider <b>through-wall</b> bending stress is not included and consideration of a buckling allowable is considered adequate. However, for safety-related pipes, investigation to include the <b>through-wall</b> bending stress is considered important. Although estimation of the internal hoop stresses in a buried pipe is relatively straight forward, several different methodologies are presented in various industry documents for calculating the <b>through-wall</b> bending stress due to the resulting internal moments. Recommended approaches for calculating the <b>through-wall</b> bending stress vary depending on the pipe material, wall thickness, wall type, deflection, burial condition and other factors. A sensitivity study comparing various theories estimating the <b>through-wall</b> bending stress in a buried pipe subject to external loads with a vertical resultant force is performed. The range of variables is assessed to determine the applicability of the results to typical safety-related piping.
