With his team of Honeywell engineers, Bateman invented the original GPWS, and continues to improve these devices. Every five years his team “comes {{up with a new}} model, not because the technology had improved but because we knew we could make it better.” These advancements {{led to the creation of}} the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS). This program provides a better visualization than the GPWS did. At a glance, pilots can view a visual display of hazardous terrain below and ahead of the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|A {{wide range}} of {{avionics}} have been integrated upon the AW119, which are typically housed within the rotorcraft's nose. Initial production models featured conventional flight instruments; the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit is integrated on the newer AW119Kx variant, which is claimed to improve situational awareness, reduce pilot workload, and increase safety. Primary flight and other key information is displayed to the pilots upon two large 10.4 inch multi-function displays in the cockpit; an independently powered stand-by display is also present in case of system failure. Other avionics used include a 3-axis aircraft flight control system (AFCS), Synthetic Vision System (SVS), Highway In The Sky (HITS) depiction, moving map display, radio altimeter, VOR/ILS/GPS/WAAS navigation, Aural Warning Generator, and embedded Helicopter <b>Terrain</b> <b>Avoidance</b> Warning <b>System</b> (HTAWS).|$|R
50|$|A radar {{altimeter}} measures altitude more directly, using the time {{taken for a}} radio signal to reflect from the surface back to the aircraft. Alternatively, Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar can be used. The greater the frequency shift the further the distance traveled. This method can achieve much better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and {{radar altimeter}}s that use frequency modulation are industry standard. The radar altimeter is used to measure height above ground level during landing in commercial and military aircraft. Radar altimeters are also a component of <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> warning <b>systems,</b> warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low, or if there is rising terrain ahead. Radar altimeter technology is also used in terrain-following radar allowing fighter aircraft to fly at very low altitude.|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{localization}} {{of moving}} targets using a Monopulse/FMCW Radar system signal processing scheme {{is presented in}} this work. During many years radar sensor application {{has been used to}} measure different target parameters and consecutively leading to spatial localization systems, so that has been an active research area in many important fields, from military to civilian applications. Spatial localization of moving targets consists of sensing and estimating the coordinates where the target is located and its speed and direction. The immediate goal of this work is to measure the distance, velocity and angle parameters of each target detected basing on a set of FMCW-Radar measurements and a monopulse phase comparison method, therefore obtaining spatial localization of moving targets scheme, taking into account that the localization area should be limited depending on the radar sensor used and its features. Like this, {{there is a need to}} achieve the localization with the best possible measurement accuracy and in any situation, and this can be solved with a simple and cheap technology as mm-wave FMCW radars, that are remarkable because work-well in harsh environments and have a very high resolution for ranging, velocity and imaging method, a distance measurement resolution of 2 cm can be easily achieved over 30 - 40 meters working at 24 GHz. Moreover the method presented is especially suited to detect very weak moving targets. Many applications where FMCW radar and Monopulse radar are playing an important role are: disaster situations of buried alive people, level-measuring systems, dimension verification systems, wall penetrating applications, air traffic control, <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems,</b> etc [1]. It is clear that all cited applications could become more attractive and useful by using a suitable localization method as presented in this work. Besides the theoretical development and explanation of the proposed method, exemplary situations and measurements results will be presented to illustrate the capability of the algorithm. Real measurements will be made using a Monopulse/FSK/FMCW Radar with one transmitter / two receiver antennas at K-band. The signal evaluation was applied on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to facilitate real time processing.

40|$|Military {{aircraft}} regularly conduct {{missions that}} include low-atltitude, near-terrain flight {{in order to}} increase covertness and payload effectiveness. Civilian applications include airborne fire fighting, police surveillance, search and rescue, and helicopter emergency medical service. Several fixed-wing aircraft now employ terrain elevation maps and forward-pointed radars to achieve automated terrain following or <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> flight. Similar <b>systems</b> specialized to helicopters and their flight regime have not received as much attention. A helicopter guidance system relying on digitized terrain elevation maps has been developed that employs airborne navigation, mission requirements, aircraft performance limits, and radar altimeter returns to generate a valley-seeking, low-altitude trajectory between waypoints. The guidance trajectory is symbolically presented to the pilot on a helmet mounted display. This system has been flight tested to 150 ft (45. 7 m) above ground level altitude at 80 kts, and is primarily limited by the ability of the pilot to perform manual detection and avoidance of unmapped hazards. In this study, a wide field of view laser radar sensor has been incorporated into this guidance system to assist the pilot in obstacle detection and avoidance, while expanding the system's operational flight envelope. The results from early flight tests of this system are presented. Low-altitude missions to 100 ft (30. 5 m) altitude at 80 n kts in the presence of unmapped natural and man-made obstacles were demonstrated while the pilot maintained situational awareness and tracking of the guidance trajectory. Further reductions in altitude are expected with continued flight testing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> control methodology for autonomous rotorcraft applied to low altitude flight. A model predictive control formulation {{is used to}} adequately address the <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> problem, which involves stabilizing a nonlinear highly coupled dynamic model, while avoiding collisions with the terrain and preventing input and state saturations. Computing the model predictive control law amounts to solving a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem subject to the state difference equations that describe the rotorcraft nonlinear dynamic model. State and input saturations {{are added to the}} optimization cost functional as penalties and <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> is achieved by penalizing the distance between the vehicle and the closest point on the terrain, yielding smooth and collision-free trajectories. Simulation results, obtained with a simplified version of a small-scale helicopter nonlinear dynamic model, are presented to assess the performance of the methodology with different reference paths and terrain profiles, including the extreme case where a desired path leads to collision with the terrain...|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Naren Bhosle, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} Computer Science, {{presented}} on March 02, 2009, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: AMELORIATING AERIAL NEAR MISSES WITH PCA DEVICES AND MOTL MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Henry Hexmoor A near miss is an unplanned event in air traffic {{that does not}} result in direct injury, illness or material damage. However, since an air craft come close to one another, there is threat of collision. An immediate consequence of near miss is tremendous psychological fear. Near misses are headline news and each case is investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Every pilot during flying hours has to record near misses. Although human error is commonly an initiating event, a faulty process or system invariably permits or compounds the harm, and should {{be the focus of}} improvement. Statistics tell us that for every 300 near misses there is one serious injury. To help every pilot to navigate with ease and to avoid collision and reduce the number of near misses, public collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> are inexistence. There are many Commercial Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> exist such as Airborne Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (ACAS), Beacon-based Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (BCAS), Air Traffic Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS), Air Traffic Controller (ATC), Portable Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (PCAS), etc,. Portable Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> as it is a decentralized system and has many benefits. Our objective is to count the number of near misses and to calculate the efficiency of a Portable Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System.</b> Our inputs to achieve my objective would be a PCAS plus Flight simulator environment. We would like to simulate the environment using Net Logo. In this simulation we would compute the relative locations of the flights and check whether it can be considered as a near miss. Finally, we would like to enumerate the results in presence of a Portable Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> and in absence of it. With the help of which we can tell, to what level does a Portable Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> yields a good result when compared to the environment with the absence of PCAS...|$|R
50|$|The airline {{industry}} {{has been working with}} the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) since 1955 toward a collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>system.</b> It was not until the mid-1970s, however, that research centered on using signals from ATCRBS airborne transponders as the cooperative element of a collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>system.</b> This technical approach allows a collision avoidance capability on the flight deck, which is independent of the ground system. In 1981, the FAA announced our decision to implement an aircraft collision avoidance concept called the Traffic Alert and Collision <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS). The concept is based upon agency and industry development efforts in the areas of beacon based collision <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> and air-to-air discrete address communications techniques utilizing Mode S airborne transponder message formats.|$|R
50|$|The {{slow speeds}} {{necessary}} for the formations, 105 kn for the helicopters and 145 kn for the A-1s, degraded nearly all modes of the Combat Talon's AN/APQ-115 TF/TA navigational radars. The Terrain Following mode computed changes in altitude only to a programmed minimum airspeed of 160 kn, well outside {{the parameters of the}} mission. The <b>Terrain</b> <b>Avoidance</b> mode (adapted from the AN/APQ-99 <b>terrain</b> <b>avoidance</b> radar of the RF-4C photo reconnaissance aircraft) was distorted by the nose-high attitude dictated by the slow speeds and would no longer display hazardous terrain directly in front of or below the Combat Talon's flight path. The Doppler radar (used to calculate wind drift and ground speed) often had to use information in its computer's memory because of processing lapses. While the ground-mapping radar (correlating landmarks shown on maps to radar returns) was not affected, the jungle terrain did not provide easily identifiable points. All of these handicaps were overcome with the external pod installation of FLIR, which readily identified the rivers and lakes used as turning points.|$|R
