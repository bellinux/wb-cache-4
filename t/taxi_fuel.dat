40|$|Abstract—Stringent {{federal and}} state {{programs}} along with technology innovation have resulted in declining emissions from static sources (e. g. power plants) and are projected to meet national quality standards by 2025. The same cannot be said for mobile sources of emissions from flight operations at airports. In the absence changes in airport operations, the forecast rates of growth in flight operations will jeopardize State’s abilities to lower emissions to meet Federal standards. Recent studies indicate that 96 % of flights in the U. S. accrue their delays at the airports and directly impact local non-attainment through emissions. This paper examines the sensitivity of emission factors (number of engines, engine efficiency and fleet mix, taxi-out time) through a case-study of departure operations at Orlando (MCO) and New York-LaGuardia. Under the assumptions of a representative fleet mix, departure schedule, runway assignment, and taxi flows, “feasible single engine ” taxi-out procedures reduced emissions (CO/NOx/SOx/HC) by 27 % at MCO and 45 % at LGA. To achieve {{the same level of}} emissions reduction requires a 25 % decrease in taxi-out time at MCO, and 44 % decrease at LGA. The implications of these results on optimization of surface operations to minimize emissions are discussed.

40|$|Taxiing {{aircraft}} {{contribute significantly}} to the fuel burn and emissions at airports. This thesis investigates the possibility of reducing fuel burn and emissions from surface operations through a reduction of the taxi times of departing aircraft. Data analysis of the departing traffic in four major US airports provides a comprehensive assessment {{of the impact of}} surface congestion on <b>taxi</b> times, <b>fuel</b> burn and emissions. For this analysis two metrics are introduced: one that compares the taxi times to the unimpeded ones and another that evaluates them in terms of their contribution to the airport's throughput. A novel approach is proposed that models the aircraft departure process as a queuing system. The departure taxi (taxi-out) time of an aircraft is represented as a sum of three components: the unimpeded taxi-out time, the time spent in the departure queue, and the congestion delay due to ramp and taxiway interactions. The dependence of the taxi-out time on these factors is analyzed and modeled. The performance of the model is validated through a comparison of its predictions with observed data at Boston's Logan International Airport (BOS). A reduction in taxi times may be achieved through the queue management strategy known as N-Control, which controls the push back process so as to keep the number of departing aircraft {{on the surface of the}} airport below a specified threshold. The developed model is used to quantify the impact of N-Control on <b>taxi</b> times, delays, <b>fuel</b> burn and emissions at BOS. Finally, the benefits and implications of N-Control are compared to the ones theoretically achievable from a scheme that controls the takeoff queue of each departing aircraft. by Ioannis Simaiakis.

40|$|Emissions {{during the}} ground {{movement}} are mostly calculated based on International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) emission databank. The {{fuel flow rate}} is normally assumed as a constant, hence the emission index. Therefore, no detailed discrimination of power settings during ground movement is considered to account for different emissions at different power settings. This {{may lead to a}} suboptimal and often unrealistic taxi planning. At the heart of the recently proposed Active Routing (AR) framework for airport ground movement is the unimpeded optimal speed profile generation, taking into account both time and fuel efficiency. However, emissions have not been included in the process of generating optimal speed profiles. Taking into account emissions in ground operations is not a trial task as not all emissions can be reduced on the same path of reducing time and fuel burn. In light of this, in this paper, a detailed analysis of three main emissions at the airports, viz. CO, Total Hydrocarbon (HC), and NOx, are carried out in order to obtain a minimum number of conflicting objectives for generating optimal speed profiles. The results show that NOx has a strong linear correlation with fuel burn across all aircraft categories. For the heavy aircraft, HC and CO should be treated individually apart from the time and fuel burn objectives. For medium and light aircraft, a strong correlation between HC, CO and time has been observed, indicating a reduced number of objectives will be sufficient to account for <b>taxi</b> time, <b>fuel</b> burn and emissions. The generated optimal speed profiles with consideration of different emissions will have impact on the resulted taxiing planning using the AR and also affect decisions regarding airport regulations...|$|R

Currently NASA and American Airlines are jointly developing a decision-support tool called Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) that assists airport ramp controllers to make gate pushback decisions and improve the overall efficiency of airport surface traffic.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} control {{strategy}} for airport operations that integrates the management of arrivals and departures. The strategy is based on four central ideas: (1) the objective of reducing aircraft flight times, <b>taxi</b> times and <b>fuel</b> burn, (2) the emphasis on developing models using data from actual aircraft operations, (3) the need to be compatible with current air tra+c control procedures, and (4) the requirement to not adversely a,ect airport performance. The scope of this work covers the airport surface and arrival airspace, which are two of the most congested regions of the air transportation network. A new approach is proposed for modeling airport surface operations. Drawing an analogy from the field of network congestion control, the airport surface is assumed to be a network consisting of major taxiways and their intersections. Posing the problem in this framework relaxes the re-quirement of precisely predicting the taxi time of each aircraft, instead emphasizing the accurate representation of the underlying stochastic processes. At the same time, it allows one to address the issues of network stability and performance through analytical approaches.

Petrol fuelled vehicles are fitted with natural gas vehicle (NGV) conversion kit to enable bi-fuel operation between CNG and petrol. This experimental approach {{is focused on the}} fuel consumption, exhaust emission and fuel cost between natural gas and petrol operations. The specially constructed test rig comprises of the bi-fuel fuel system employed in the 1500 cc 12 valves carburettor engine NGV <b>taxis.</b> The inherent <b>fuel</b> consumption and corresponding exhaust emission are acquired at different engine revolution per minute (rpm) during petrol and CNG operation separately. The engine rpm operating without load is varied from idle to more than 5000 rpm to acquire the fuel consumption and exhaust emission profile. These two acquired data are then used to calculate the engine’s air fuel ratio. All three parameters acquired are used to conduct comparisons between petrol and natural gas operation. It is seen that the bi-fuel system operates with air fuel ratio ranging from 19 to 16. 3 for petrol operation and ranges from 40 to 18. 7 for natural gas operations. The emission during CNG operation clearly shows significant decrease in hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) over the use of petrol. In terms of cost, the use of CNG provides savings exceeding 50 % through all engine rpm compared to petrol non-loaded operations...|$|R

The main advantages of SA are; it deals with arbitrary systems and cost functions, relatively easy to code, even for complex problems. But its main disadvantage is that, it cannot tell whether it has found an optimal solution, it requires some complimentary bound [295]. Pant, R.

In case of aircraft fuel consumption, the objective function was found to be highly nonlinear and discontinuous, with several combinations of design variables not having a feasible solution. Hence, gradient-based optimization methods could not be applied to obtain the optimal solution, and the SA approach was adopted [66]. Ravizza, S. et al., [120] adopted the population based immune algorithm for tradeoff between the <b>taxi</b> time and <b>fuel</b> consumption in airport ground movement. Immune Algorithms are related to the Artificial Immune Systems field of study concerned with computational methods. Immune Algorithms are inspired by the process and mechanisms of the biological immune system. The main advantages of the algorithm are dynamically adjustable population size, combination of local with global search, defined convergence criterion, and the capability of maintaining stable local optimum solutions [296]. More knowledge about the fuel-based objective function is needed to formulate the combined FCO function. Lastly the analytical-statistical research integrates logical, mathematical models from analytical-research and statistical models from empirical research for fuel consumption & optimization research. Table  2 shows the list of analytical statistical studies [20, 23, 109, 111, 130, 137, 144, 145, 156, 158]. Summarily, the main objective of analytical statistical research is to provide, the more cohesive model for empirical statistical testing [283].|$|R
