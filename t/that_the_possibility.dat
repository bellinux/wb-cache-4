5|$|Race {{officials}} {{expected a}} record turnout {{in the days}} leading up to the Preakness, estimating over 50,000 people. They hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of Secretariat completing the Triple Crown and Sham attempting to foil Secretariat's run would lead to an increase in attendance. The official attendance for the event was reported at 61,657, which surpassed the previous record of 48,721 people set in 1972. The new record lasted until 1975 when 75,216 spectators were present at Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|S. C. Hawkes {{argues that}} the eight items in the hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins. However, the historian Philip Grierson thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of two graves from different time periods both containing coins of the same period was so small as to make {{the likelihood of the}} hoard coming from two graves slim.|$|E
5|$|The {{high energy}} content of 178m2Hf was {{the concern of}} a DARPA-funded program in the US. This program {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of using a nuclear isomer of hafnium (the above-mentioned 178m2Hf) to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of induced gamma emission—was infeasible because of its expense. See Hafnium controversy.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after his spell at Inverness ended, Davis joined League One side Chesterfield on loan for three months. He was ever-present over nine league matches and also played twice in the Football League Trophy, a cup {{competition}} open to teams from {{the third and fourth}} tiers of the Football League; a 3–1 aggregate win against Oldham Athletic in the Northern Final earned Chesterfield a place in the final itself. On 6 March, he was recalled by Wolves' new manager, Terry Connor, after an injury to Karl Henry left Wolves in need of midfield cover. Davis himself felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of playing Premier League football for Wolves far outweighed the prospect of a Wembley final.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|In September rumours {{were already}} {{circulating}} among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, {{this time the}} destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies. After much contention, {{it was decided to}} send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.|$|E

5|$|To {{combat the}} {{perceived}} threat of brucellosis transmission to cattle, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds {{back into the}} park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996–97, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. Animal rights activists argue {{that this is a}} cruel practice and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

25|$|Baird {{was called}} to a 29 February 1944 meeting of Cable and Wireless (C) to discuss the {{formation}} of a color television studio. After some discussion, C chairman Edward Wilshaw noted that there was an agreement in place that precluded Marconi from entering the market until 1949, which would place them at a significant disadvantage compared to other companies. He suggested that the matter be deferred, as any immediate changes would produce friction between C, the General Post Office and the BBC. The matter was dropped, and it would not be until the Television Act 1954 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> was again considered.|$|E
