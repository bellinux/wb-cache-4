40|$|AbstractIn any {{communication}} system, {{the emphasis}} is on estimating the channel response so as to retrieve the <b>transmitted</b> <b>input</b> signal accurately at the receiver‟s end. Channel Equalization at the transmitter refers to pre-distorting the input signal so that the effect of the channel is nullified during transmission. In this article, we study the performance of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) wavelet packet multicarrier modulation (WPMCM) with a low complex pre-distortive type channel equalization technique at the transmitter which adapts to the channel variations. WPM offers much lower side lobes in transmitted signal, which reduce its sensitivity to ICI and narrowband interference. Due to time overlapping, WPMCM systems don‟t require cyclic prefix (CP) or guard interval (GI) thus enhancing the bandwidth efficiency compared to conventional OFDM systems. This approach works out for slow fading channels where the channel response remains almost constant for a considerable amount of time (coherence time) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Remote desktop systems enable {{business}} {{users to}} access critical data {{located in the}} office from outside it with a mobile thin client or any other portable ubiquitous devices without {{having to worry about}} data leakage. However, high latency and low bandwidth in wireless-network environments may degrade the performance of remote desktop clients, such as causing slow responses to keyboard/mouse input and low speed in playing animated presentations. We therefore propose a method of transmitting data to improve the way business applications are perceived in wireless thin clients. It utilizes multiple wireless-network paths to achieve short latency in <b>transmitting</b> <b>input</b> signals and receiving responses as well as increases the throughput of large desktop images. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method using a network simulator and a real network environment.

40|$|Abstract: Semi-spherical CVT(SS-CVT) {{is one of}} {{friction}} drives, which transmits power via the friction force between a spherical shaped variator and output disks. The variator varies the speed ratio of SS-CVT continuously as well as <b>transmits</b> <b>input</b> power into the output shaft. Therefore two friction forces are normally applied on the variator; one is the longitudinal friction force for power transmission {{and the other is}} the lateral for shifting. In order to investigate the dynamic behavior of SS-CVT, we introduced a numerical model of 2 -dimensional friction force using a function of slip ratio and slip angle. And a dynamic model, which describes the shifting mechanism of SS-CVT, is developed through 3 -dimensional vector analysis. Finally we presented numerical results of the shift characteristics focused on the transient behavior of the variator’s slip ratio and slip angle. The numerical results also show the typical CVT shifting characteristics of SS-CVT and stable shifting behaviors of the variator...|$|R
