5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{southeast}} Asian jungle cats {{still used}} to be the most common wild cats near villages in certain parts of northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, jungle cats are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due to hunting and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, jungle cats have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.|$|E

5|$|Repeating nines also <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken}} into account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{need for}} the Mint to produce any pennies in 1933 because they was no {{commercial}} demand, and it possessed ample stocks from prior years in storage. There was a custom at that time for the King to place a set of coins of the current year under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the British Museum, and at least two others. The result was a rarity that people thought might <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.|$|E
25|$|Factorials also <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> calculus; for example, {{they occur}} in the denominators {{of the terms of}} Taylor's formula, where they are used as {{compensation}} terms due to the n-th derivative of x'n being equivalent to n!.|$|E

25|$|In this sense, {{it is no}} {{surprise}} that Bach's music is easily and often performed on instruments it was not necessarily written for, that it is transcribed so often, and that his melodies <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> unexpected places such as jazz music. Apart from that, Bach left a number of compositions without specified instrumentation: the Canons BWV 1072–1078 fall in that category, as well as the bulk of The Musical Offering and The Art of Fugue.|$|E

Japanese Agriculture Minister Shigeru Ishiba appeared on television to reassure customers that it is safe to eat pork. The Japanese farm ministry said that it would not ask for restrictions on pork imports because the virus was unlikely to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> pork, and would be killed by cooking.|$|E

25|$|Following similar {{events in}} Tunisia during the Arab Spring, Egyptian activists called for protesters to <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> cities around Egypt on {{specific}} days. Though violence was reported at some points, protests were largely peaceful {{with the army}} staying quiet until 10 February 2011, when calls for Hosni Mubarak to resign were at their peak. The following day, Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation from the presidency while turning power over to the military.

Her observations of Stuart's creative processand how to print on Stuarts hand pressmake it a unique chronicle. Gloria Stuart's paintings are represented by the Papillon Gallery in Los Angeles and I Dated Oppenheimer, her last miniature artist's book, is represented by Lorson's Books and Prints.

25|$|The {{existence}} of white Siberian tigers {{has not been}} scientifically documented, despite occasional unsubstantiated reports of sightings of white tigers in the regions where wild Siberian tigers live. It {{may be that the}} white mutation does not exist in the wild Siberian tiger population: no white Siberian tigers have been born in captivity, {{despite the fact that the}} subspecies has been extensively bred during the last few decades (with much outbreeding between the different Siberian lineages for purposes of conservation genetics); a recessive allele should occasionally <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a homozygous state during such breeding, and in this particular case yield white tigers from normally-colored parents, but no such animals have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The main {{military}} force mentioned is the Space Corps, composed of marines and fleets, who fight against alien races that threaten the colonies. (When originally introduced in The Corps spinoff, they were Judges from the Academy of Law but in later stories these are recruited citizens.) Another force are the Genetic Infantry: genetically engineered men, bred {{in a lab}} to be dedicated soldiers. (The story Warzone had an ex-Genetic Infantry soldier who was a primitive version of the Genetic Infantry from Rogue Trooper.) The Citi-Defs (Citizen Defence) are a reserve force composed of citizens. Each city block contains a Citi-Def force in case of crises, though usually they <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Dredd as rogue factions waging block wars.|$|E
