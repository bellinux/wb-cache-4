5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should {{catch up with the}} presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|Morgan placed marksmen at {{strategic}} positions, {{who then}} picked off virtually every {{officer in the}} advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived {{just in time to}} attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.|$|E
5|$|Din's attendant, Impa, tells Link that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> for Hyrule; she instructs {{him to see}} the Maku Tree in Horon Village, {{the capital}} of Holodrum. Link finds a sword in a cave and makes his way to the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link {{retrieves}} the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg did {{not expect}} such a {{campaign}} and his army {{was not ready to}} halt the advances. According to an act released Monopoli in Apulia, an army of 300,000 soldiers (a figure considered to be exaggerated) had marched into Albania, massacred 14,000 people, and sacked many populated areas, while Skanderbeg was preparing to flee to Italy. However, Skanderbeg had remained in Albania but he had sent twelve ships with many inhabitants of Krujë to Italy as refugees. With them, he sent his wife, Donika, and his son, John. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> to Monte Sant'Angelo, a castle awarded to Skanderbeg after his campaigns to restore Ferdinand's rule. The arrival of Albanian refugees further distressed the pope and many Italians who had come to believe that Albania had been conquered and that Mehmed was now preparing to march into Italy. News to the contrary also reached Rome saying that the League of Lezhë had not been broken and that Krujë still stood.|$|E
5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. In the house where Morgan stayed, the table was set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E
5|$|United States Congressman Larry McDonald from Georgia, who at {{the time}} was also the second {{president}} of the conservative John Birch Society, was on the flight.

The Soviets contended former U.S. president Richard Nixon was to have been seated next to Larry McDonald on KAL 007 but that the CIA warned him not to go, according to the New York Post and Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS); this was denied by Nixon.|$|E

5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street whether or not <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians {{as a result of his}} evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E

25|$|The British {{already knew}} that the German fleet had sailed at midday. More {{information}} arrived at 20:15, when an intercepted wireless message gave the information that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> for Yarmouth. At 15:50, the British fleet had been placed on two hours readiness and at 19:05 were ordered to sail south from Scapa Flow. Around midnight, the Harwich Force (Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt) of three light cruisers and 18destroyers was ordered to move north.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1885 the 10th left Fort Davis for the Department of Arizona. While en route, the widely {{scattered}} troops began {{to come together and}} formed a full regiment of 12 troops for the first and only time in its history. Bigelow stated it was a sight to see and would never be seen again. On May 20, 1885, the regiment reached its new headquarters at Fort Apache, Arizona territory. Within weeks <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> to various isolated posts and forts for duty.|$|E

He then asked Parker questions where the Comanche raiders were and where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed.</b> Parker glanced toward one direction and pointed off in a different direction while Tafoya translated. Parker never used English with Nolan even though he spoke it well.|$|E
25|$|In mid-October, the Royal Lao Army's 12th Brigade and 13th Brigades were helilifted into Operation Tulah (Operation October). The six battalions {{were moved}} from Vang Vieng onto the Plain of Jars. They were landed at two {{helicopter}} landing zones 13 kilometers {{southwest of the}} Communist-held forward fighter base at Muang Soui. One Royalist column moved toward Xieng Dat. A second column slowly patrolled back westwards along Route 7; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> for the Royalist-held intersection of Routes 7 and 13 at Sala Phou Khoun. Operation Tulah ended on 25 October, after the Royalist regulars were unable to dislodge the Pathet Lao Hmong Communists from Xieng Dat.|$|E
25|$|By 1938, Communist {{organizers}} had {{a wealth}} of experience in sidestepping police spies. On the afternoon of 20 May 1938, approximately 1200 men left from four different halls in the East End of Vancouver, most of them believing <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> to Stanley Park for a protest rally. Only when one group arrived at the corner of Granville and Hastings streets did it become evident that their destination was the post office. Over 700 men flooded into the recently renovated building. Police reinforcements were called from Granville and Georgia Streets, leaving the way clear for a second column of 200 to enter Hotel Georgia, while a third group of 300 entered the art gallery.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile the Norwegian {{electrical}} manufacturer Norsk Elektrisk {{intended to}} enter the tram market. They cooperated with Skabo to build a tram with the same specifications as the Class A, which was completed in 1895. They applied KES to conduct trial runs on their tramway, but KES had a clause in their contract with AEG which hindered from fraternizing with other manufacturers. NEBB was therefore forced to carry out tests on their own private tracks. However, KES {{was able to use}} the incident as leverage to get two additional trams delivered in 1896. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> to the Straßburg Tramway, but delays there allowed them to be relocated to Oslo and numbered 23–24.|$|E
25|$|The Train {{embarked}} upon HMAT A39 Port MacQuarie on 3 June with, {{according to}} the Train's Medical Officer, Dr E.W. Morris, 5 officers, 3 warrant officers, 267 Petty Officers and other ranks, 26 reinforcements, 412 horses, 5 6-horse pontoons and tressle waggons, and 8 other vehicles. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> to Chatham, England to be trained {{in the construction of}} pontoons. Of course, this was the First World War. The Train reached Port Said, Egypt on 17 July 1915, and was issued orders to continue on to England. The next day, the 18th, they received orders to the Dardanelles. Arriving at the Greek isle of Imbros, yet more new orders were received, transferring control of the Train from the British Admiralty, which had been given operational control of the Royal Australian Navy by the Federal Government on 10 August 1914, to the British Army and attaching it to IX Army Corps under Lt. General Stopford which was to land at Suvla Bay on 7 August.|$|E
25|$|From the {{evidence}} that could be gathered, it appeared Waterhouse and Connolly became lost in a rainstorm and hugged the coast of Baja California southward, thinking <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> north along the Pacific Coast. They landed safely on the beach about twenty miles north of Bahia de Los Angeles. Their sole chance for survival seemed to be staying with the plane until found. Tortured by heat, thirst, and hunger, they waited seventeen days, but the search never reached that far south. Finally two fishermen came along and took them in a canoe to Bahia de Los Angeles. There the Americans were murdered, apparently for the little money they had. Their bodies, buried in the sand, were discovered {{within a day or}} two by an American geological survey party and rediscovered a week later by an American mining engineer. The news, however, did not reach Rockwell Field until 13 October. Three days later, a Navy ship, USS Aaron Ward, sailed from San Diego with a group of Army officers to recover the bodies.|$|E
