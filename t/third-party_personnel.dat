50|$|Hicom 300 is a {{telephone}} exchange system from Siemens, originally {{sold in the}} US as the ROLM 9751-9006i, and is used by big companies such as UBS, Swisscom, Nestl√© and Tamco. The Hicom system has been surpassed by the HiPath 4000 system (since 2013 Unify OpenScape 4000) (which is in turn being surpassed by Siemens's VoIP offerings). The Hicom/HiPath series are a modular set of phone systems which come in several shapes and sizes, from the smallest wall-mountable units which support a few dozen clients to the largest modular block units which take multiple cards for digital (ISDN), POTS (analog), and VoIP cards. These phones are typically administered via a LAN card with Siemens's phone management software ('Manager E' {{also known as the}} 'ASS_150e.exe'), and are extremely powerful. Customer passwords are heavily encrypted in the KDS files but may be hacked using simple programs developed by <b>third-party</b> <b>personnel.</b> The HiPath 3000 system can be integrated with a range of Siemens applications which were actually written by other companies and then rebranded.|$|E
50|$|Several {{development}} disciplines, such as audio, dialogue, or motion capture, {{occur for}} relatively {{short periods of}} time. Efficient employment of these roles requires either large development house with multiple simultaneous title production or outsourcing from <b>third-party</b> vendors. Employing <b>personnel</b> for these tasks full-time is expensive, so a majority of developers outsource {{a portion of the}} work. Outsourcing plans are conceived during the pre-production stage; where the time and finances required for outsourced work are estimated.|$|R
