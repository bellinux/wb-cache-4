40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether unattended speech is processed at a semantic level in dichotic listening using a semantic priming paradigm. A lexical decision task was administered in which target words {{were presented in}} <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> auditory channel, preceded by two prime words presented simultaneously in <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> and unattended channels, respectively. Both attended and unattended primes were either semantically related or unrelated to <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> targets. Attended primeâ€“target pairs were presented in isolation, whereas unattended primes were presented {{in the context of}} a series of rapidly presented words. The fundamental frequency of <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli was increased by 40 [*]Hz relative to the unattended stimuli, and the unattended stimuli were attenuated by 12 [*]dB [+ 12 [*]dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ] or presented at the same intensity level as <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> stimuli (0 [*]dB SNR). The results revealed robust semantic priming of attended targets by attended primes at both the + 12 and 0 [*]dB SNRs. However, semantic priming by unattended primes emerged only at the 0 [*]dB SNR. These findings suggest that the semantic processing of unattended speech in dichotic listening depends critically on the relative intensities of <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> and competing signals...|$|R

5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles {{who was in charge of}} the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> {{physician}} warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E

5|$|After {{a fashion}} model dies while {{undergoing}} an illegal abortion, <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> doctor moves her body {{back to her}} home, staging her death to remove any trace of his involvement. However, he is murdered by a stranger disguised in racing leathers and a motorcycle helmet. At the Albatross Modelling Agency, womanising photographer Carlo (Nino Castelnuovo) embarks on an affair with fellow photographer Magda (Edwige Fenech). Meanwhile, a newly hired model, Patrizia (Solvi Stubing), fends off the unwanted advances of Maurizio (Franco Diogene), whose wife owns the agency. One evening, Mario (Claudio Pellegrini), who also works at the agency, invites a woman in racing leathers into his home for a drink, and is stabbed to death. The police question the agency's owner Gisella (Lia Amanda) and another model, Lucia (Femi Benussi) about the killing, but learn very little. Gisella and Lucia are sleeping together; one night when Gisella leaves after a fight, Lucia is attacked and killed.|$|E

5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|Jolie has fronted a {{campaign}} against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011). PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation. Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting, where <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject, {{which resulted in a}} protocol endorsed by 151 nations.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E

5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no questions for <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick {{was surprised to}} hear that his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around Â£100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakout}} of the First World War, Morton travelled to Labrador {{to work in}} the Mission Hospitals there, {{before being}} made a special commissioner of the Red Cross to take supplies from Paris to the Macedonian Front and work at the field hospitals in Macedonia. Following the success of her male family members, Morton was the first women to become <b>the</b> <b>Attending</b> Surgeon at the Vanderbilt Clinic of Columbia University's Physicians and Surgeons in 1916. After returning to New York Morton, alongside Mary M. Crawford, led the American Women's Hospitals Service from 1917 after it was founded by the Medical Women's National Association with the aim of establishing American hospitals in Europe. After her request to send one thousand medical women who had volunteered for foreign service was opposed by the General Medical Board in Washington, she raised over $300,000 in 10 days through a national fundraising drive to send them. At the recommendation of William C. Gorgas, Morton was made chairman of the committee of women physicians on the United States Council of National Defense, where she represented over 7000 female doctors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDirecting {{attention}} {{to one of}} two superimposing surfaces composed of dot fields rotating in opposing directions facilitates processing of brief translations of <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> surface [Valdes-Sosa, M., Bobes, M. A., Rodriguez, V., & Pinilla, T. (1998). Switching attention without shifting the spotlight object-based attentional modulation of brain potentials. Journal of Cognition and Neuroscience, 10 (1), 137 â€“ 151]. Here we used ERP recordings to investigate the mechanisms of endogenous attentional selection of such competing dot surfaces under conditions of dichoptic viewing (one surface to each eye) and monocular viewing (both surfaces to one eye). Under dichoptic conditions, which induced binocular rivalry, translations of <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> surface presented to one eye elicited enhanced visual P 1 and N 1 ERP components relative to translations of the unattended surface presented to the other eye. In comparison, during monocular viewing <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> surface translations elicited a significantly larger N 1 component {{in the absence of any}} P 1 modulation. These results indicate that processing of <b>the</b> <b>attended</b> surface is biased at an earlier level in extrastriate visual cortex under conditions of inter-ocular versus intra-ocular competition...|$|R

5|$|As Karlsruhe steamed to Barbados on {{the night}} of 4 November, a {{spontaneous}} internal explosion destroyed the ship. The hull was split in half; the bow section quickly sank and took with it KÃ¶hler and most of the crew. The stern remained afloat long enough for 140 of the ship's crew to escape onto <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> colliers. Commander Studt, the senior surviving officer, took charge and placed all of his men aboard the liner Rio Negro. He scuttled the second collier and steamed north for Iceland. The ship used the cover of a major storm to slip through the British blockade of the North Sea, and put in at Ã…lesund, Norway. Rio Negro then returned to Germany by early December. The Admiralstab, unaware of the loss of Karlsruhe, coincidentally radioed the ship to order her to return to Germany. Germany kept the loss of the ship a secret, and the British continued searching for her until they learned of her fate in March 1915. KÃ¶hler's widow christened the cruiser Karlsruhe, the third to bear the name, at her launching in August 1927.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, {{the baby was}} born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling <b>the</b> <b>attending</b> nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{goes into}} cardiac arrest and is taken into an {{operating}} room she is temporarily stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter {{in case the}} baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. <b>The</b> <b>attending</b> surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.|$|E
