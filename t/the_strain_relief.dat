The relationship between lattice constants c and a obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis shows that indium doping interlayer can reduce the stress in GaN layers. The stress in GaN decreases with increasing trimethylindium (TMIn) during interlayer growth. Moreover, for a smaller TMIn flow, the stress in GaN decreases dramatically when In acts as a surfactant to improve the crystallinity of the AlGaN interlayer, and for a larger TMIn flow, the stress will increase again.
