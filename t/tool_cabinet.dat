She has also made guest appearances in songs and videos with other YouTube artists. Though she generally uses traditional instruments in her songs, O'Connell has sometimes used unconventional means when recording, including waterglasses, a metal <b>tool</b> <b>cabinet,</b> kicks to a garage door, a tennis racket covered in change, and even a deck of playing cards.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{conventional}} <b>tool</b> <b>cabinets,</b> storage {{systems that}} provide the operator with the shelf containing the desired product are often used. The relationship between the item number and the storage location is saved in tool management. When booking a tool removal in the logistics area of tool management the storage system is operated automatically. Alternatively, assignment of storage locations can be configured in the storage system. The removal is then performed on the storage system and the inventory change is transmitted to tool management.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{manufacturers}} of road/rail inspection trucks, {{otherwise known as}} HiRail trucks. These HiRail inspection cars are almost all ultrasonic testing exclusively, {{but there are some}} with the capability to perform multiple tests. These trucks are loaded with high speed computers using advanced programs which recognize patterns and contain classification information. The trucks are also equipped with storage space, <b>tool</b> <b>cabinets,</b> and workbenches. A GPS unit is used with the computer to mark new defects and locate previously marked defects. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) requires that any indications of defects need to be hand verified immediately. The GPS system allows a follow up car to find precisely where the flaw was detected by the lead vehicle. One advantage to the HiRail trucks is that they can work around regular rail traffic without shutting down or slowing down entire stretches of track. However, because railroad management frequently orders HiRail trucks to be used to inspect tracks at speeds over 50 mph, tracks reported as having been inspected are, in fact, not inspected. A NTSB report on the Amtrak derailment in Oregon in 2006 documented this fact.|$|R

These can be freely positioned according to the requirements of the specific room. The result is a kitchen that appears to float. But the multi-function wall doesn’t only support kitchen <b>tools</b> and <b>cabinets.</b> Knife blocks, kitchen roll holders and shelves can also be hung from its grooves. In addition, function boxes with hinged openings provide additional storage space, keeping all utensils, food, and herbs and spices close to hand.

From a sarcophagus dated to 200 -- 300 CE, i.e, about the time Plotinus was in Rome. Though found in Ostia, a port near Rome, the Greek inscription suggests a Greek resident. The open case containing surgical <b>tools</b> on the <b>cabinet</b> top, the other scrolls, and a basin for bleeding patients within the cabinet suggest a learned physician (Metropolitan Museum of Art, N.Y., 48.76.1).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Walter Bagehot {{wrote in}} the 19 th century about using ministerial resignations as a <b>tool</b> for <b>cabinet</b> {{rotation}} and ridding the cabinet of incapable members. Throughout the 20 th century, more definition {{was given to the}} instances in which ministers should resign. Many of these reasons focused on the policy and administrative conduct of ministers. For the most part, governments would abide by the policy and administrative rules when deciding who should be removed from cabinet. This paper will explain how such decisions are “rational. ” In examining the Canadian cases of ministerial resignations since 1968, there are several decisions for ministerial resignations that fall outside these rational decisions. One such trend is that of Liberal Party leadership hopefuls who seem more prone to resign not for policy or administrative lapses, but because they have been groomed to take over the leadership of the party. Over the 40 year period of this study, resignation decisions for Liberal Party leadership hopefuls have effectively become rational reasons for ministers to resign. This paper will use organizational theory to explain the phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The private naval armaments {{industry}} in Britain between the wars comprised around fifteen large firms which supplied and constructed almost {{every part of}} every warship over one thousand tons between the Armistice and {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. Most long predated 1914, and were trusted implicitly by their main customer, the Admiralty. The relationship between these firms and the British state is of interest to historians: disarmament posed problems for the retention of capacity of private industry and the ability to meet the demands for rapid naval expansion that were later placed upon Britain, creating significant challenges for defence planners. This article shows how private industry reacted to the challenges of disarmament and later collaborated to profit from rearmament. In doing so it argues that this was allowed to occur because the Admiralty was not given <b>tools</b> by <b>Cabinet</b> and the Treasury to preserve industrial capacity, and thus despite the conspiracy to profiteer within private industry, the formation of a warship building cartel probably saved the governments of the 1920 s and 1930 s from themselves...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to know the}} quality of snakehead (Channa striata) being smoked by tools with different resources of the smoke. This study was conducted from April 2015 until May 2015 in Complex Independent Kayu Agung, Bioprocess Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Technology Laboratory of Fisheries, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Sriwijaya, and the Central Laboratory of Agro Industry Bogor. The method used is a randomized block design factorial (RAKF). This research used treatment were <b>tools</b> (system <b>cabinet,</b> conventional systems) and resources of the smoke (wood-fighting, shell). The parameters observed were proximate analysis (moisture content, protein content, fat content, ash content, carbohydrate content) levels of benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]anthracene. Based on the test design randomized factorial (RAKF), treatment of tools with different resources of the smoke (p> 0. 05) showed the results of analysis of water content, protein content, fat content varies for each treatment, while ash and carbohydrate content showed the results is not different for each treatment. The observation of the levels benzo[a]pyrene analysis on smoked snakehead (Channa sriata) (p> 0. 05) showed different results for each treatment and results of benzo[a]anthracene analysis showed different for each treatment. The results of analysis of benzo[a]pyrene was below the maximum threshold of Indonesian National Standard, FAO and WHO...|$|R

5000|$|Sigmund H Danziger Jr. (1916-1979) founded Homak Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1947 in Chicago. A Chicago southsider {{and son of}} a sales {{representative}} for houseware products, including bathroom scales, Mr. Danziger began his business career “jobbing” for Chicago manufacturers while {{a student at the}} University of Chicago. After the World War II, in which he served as a captain and translator, he purchased a bathroom cabinet manufacturer {{on the south side of}} Chicago for which he was jobbing. Naming the new company Homak, capturing a sign he noted on a hat store, he began manufacturing steel kitchen cabinets and rapidly moved to a 35000 sq ft building, which he designed at 4433 S. Springfield Ave in Chicago. In the early 1960s, an order for tool boxes lead to the production of a hardware line including roller <b>cabinets,</b> <b>tool</b> boxes, and other accessories. Through the 1970s and 1980s, most of the major retailers and chains of the time became either line or private label customers at one time or another, including Sears, Walmart, Kmart, The Home Depot True Value, Ace Hardware, Montgomery Ward, Coast-to-Coast, Costco, Meijer, Pep Boys, Fingerhut, etc. In 1979, Sigmund Danziger died and his wife Gertrude (Trudy), ran the company for the next 25 years. During this time, the company moved to a 400000 sq ft facility in Bedford Park, Illinois at 5151 W 73rd St. while sales grew to $35,000,000 with hardware, automotive, hospital (under Homed TM), and sporting goods lines. One of the major innovations during this period was the introduction of a consumer gun cabinet (under HomSafe TM), which instantly grew to be a major hit at mass retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Mountain, Dick's Sporting Goods and Sports Authority. Also a line of garage cabinets was introduced for Whirlpool and Sears under the label [...] "Gladiator Garageworks." [...] Homak employed hundreds of people, who enjoyed the prosperity of the industry, and was the largest privately held sheet-metal fabricator in America.|$|R
