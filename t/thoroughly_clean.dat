25|$|When an open {{collection}} system is used, the pump’s suction can cause milk to overflow {{it into the}} {{collection system}} tubing, which may lead to milk particles being drawn into the pump motor. If milk leaks into the pump's tubing, the tubes should be washed, sterilized and air-dried prior to using the pump again. Failure to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> collection tubing may lead to mold growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people are}} able to remove tonsil stones using the tip of the tongue. Oral irrigators are also simple yet {{effective}} and will <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> the tonsil crypts. Most electric oral irrigators are unsuitable for tonsil stone removal because they are too powerful and are likely to cause discomfort and rupture the tonsils, which could result in further complications such as infection. Irrigators that connect directly to the sink tap via a threaded attachment or otherwise are suitable for tonsil stone removal and everyday washing of the tonsils because they can jet water at low pressure levels that the user can adjust by simply turning the sink tap, allowing for a continuous range of pressures to suit each user's specific requirements.|$|E
25|$|Deacons {{were not}} to be allowed to receive confessions or to provide penances, or to baptise except {{in the absence of a}} priest. Children had to be {{confirmed}} within a year of baptism. The Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer were to be learned in the mother tongue; priests were to celebrate mass in clean robes, to use a silver or golden chalice; <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> corporals and at least two consecrated palls were to be placed on the altar; the cross was to be planted in front of the celebrant; the bread was to be of the purest wheaten flour, the wine mixed with water. The elements {{were not to}} be kept more than seven days; when carried to a sick person to be enclosed in a pyx, and the priest to be preceded by a cross; a candle, holy water and bell.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the {{invasive}} species {{problem in the}} buffers was complicated further by the confirmed arrival of Didymosphenia geminata, an algae species {{commonly referred to as}} rock snot, in the creek's waters between Shandaken and the reservoir. It was the third stream in the state where it has been found, after Batten Kill in Washington County and the East and West branches of the Delaware River in Delaware County, just {{to the west of the}} Esopus valley. The species can clog water intakes but poses no threat to human life. Trout are more at risk because it often grows over river bottoms, smothering the insect hatches they depend on as a food source. There is no way at present to eradicate the species; the state has instead advised fishermen to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> and disinfect their waders after trips in order to slow its growth and prevent it from reaching other streams.|$|E
2500|$|Clear hoof polish may {{be applied}} before the horse enters the arena. The horse is <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean.</b> The horse's saliva often forms [...] "foam" [...] about the horse's lips, which is {{generally}} considered to be a sign of the horse's submission and acceptance of the bit. Some riders believe that foam should not be cleaned off the horse's mouth before entering the arena due to it being a sign of submission. Conversely, some riders choose to wipe the foam from their horses' mouths prior to entering the arena, as foam can land on the horses' chests and legs. It {{should be noted that the}} presence of foam does not necessarily indicate the horse's acceptance of the bit, as certain metals such as German silver may cause the horse's salivation to increase without full acceptance of the bit.|$|E
60|$|The dogs, too, became sensibly {{affected}} by the continued absence of light, and seemed to draw more sympathetically than ever to their human companions in banishment. A curious and touching instance of this feeling was exhibited when the pack were sent to sleep on Store Island. A warm kennel had been erected for them there, partly in order that the ship might be kept more <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean,</b> and partly that the dogs might act as a guard over the stores, in case bears or wolves should take a fancy to examine them. But nothing would induce the poor animals to keep away from the ship, and remain beyond the sound of human voices. They deserted their comfortable abode, with one consent, {{the first time they}} were sent to it, preferring to spend the night {{by the side of the}} ship upon the bare snow. Coaxing them was of no use. O'Riley tried it in vain.|$|E

6000|$|From the {{beginning}} of the affair Tregear had found the necessity of bolstering himself up inwardly in his great attempt by mottoes, proverbs, and instigations to courage addressed to himself. [...] "None but the brave deserve the fair." [...] "De l'audace, et encore de l'audace, et toujours de l'audace." [...] He was a man naturally of good heart in such matters, who was not afraid of his brother-men, nor yet of women, his sisters. But in this affair he knew very much persistence would be required of him, and that even with such persistence he might probably fail, unless he should find a more than ordinary constancy in the girl. That the Duke could not eat him, indeed that nobody could eat him as long as he carried himself as an honest man and a gentleman, was to him an inward assurance on which he leaned much. And yet he was conscious, almost with a feeling of shame, that in Italy he had not spoken to the Duke about his daughter because he was afraid lest the Duke might eat him. In such an affair he should have been careful from the first to keep his own hands <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean.</b> Had it not been his duty as a gentleman to communicate with the father, if not before he gained the girl's heart, at any rate as soon as he knew he had done so? He had left Italy thinking that he would certainly meet the Duchess and her daughter in London, and that then he might go to the Duke as though this love of his had arisen from the sweetness of those meetings in London. But all these ideas had been dissipated by the great misfortune of the death of Lady Mary's mother. From all this he was driven to acknowledge to himself that his silence in Italy had been wrong, that he had been weak in allowing himself to be guided by the counsel of the Duchess, and that he had already armed the Duke with one strong argument against him.|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, what a {{beautiful}} Establishment here fitted up for the accommodation of the scoundrel-world, male and female! As I said, no Duke in England is, for all rational purposes which a human being can or ought to aim at, lodged, fed, tended, taken care of, with such perfection. Of poor craftsmen that pay rates and taxes from their day's wages, of the dim millions that toil and moil continually under the sun, we know what is the lodging and the tending. Of the Johnsons, Goldsmiths, lodged in their squalid garrets; working often enough amid famine, darkness, tumult, dust and desolation, what work they have to do:--of these as of [...] "spiritual backwoodsmen," [...] understood to be preappointed to such a life, and like the pigs to killing, [...] "quite used to it," [...] I say nothing. But of Dukes, which Duke, I could ask, has cocoa, soup, meat, and food in general made ready, so fit for keeping him in health, in ability to do and to enjoy? Which Duke has a house so <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean,</b> pure and airy; lives in an element so wholesome, and perfectly adapted to the uses of soul and body as this same, which is provided here for the Devil's regiments of the line? No Duke that I have ever known. Dukes are waited on by deleterious French cooks, by perfunctory grooms of the chambers, and expensive crowds of eye-servants, more imaginary than real: while here, Science, Human Intellect and Beneficence have searched and sat studious, eager to do their very best; they have chosen a real Artist in Governing to see their best, in all details of it, done. Happy regiments of the line, what soldier to any earthly or celestial Power has such a lodging and attendance as you here? No soldier or servant direct or indirect of God or of man, in this England at present. Joy to you, regiments of the line. Your Master, I am told, has his Elect, and professes to be [...] "Prince of the Kingdoms of this World;" [...] and truly I see he has power {{to do a good}} turn to those he loves, in England at least. Shall we say, May he, may the Devil give you good of it, ye Elect of Scoundrelism? I will rather pass by, uttering no prayer at all; musing rather in silence on the singular [...] "worship of God," [...] or practical [...] "reverence done to Human Worth" [...] (which is the outcome and essence of all real [...] "worship" [...] whatsoever) among the Posterity of Adam at this day.|$|E

50|$|Compurgation, {{also called}} wager {{of law and}} oath-helping, was a defence used {{primarily}} in medieval law.
