The authors have modified cutting mechanism principle of the orbital drilling, which named as the <b>tilted</b> planetary <b>motion</b> drilling. Its axis of tool rotation spindle is not parallel to the axis of planetary revolution. The tilted angle is adjustable from 0 to 2 degrees. Because of tool rotation axis is tilted, penetration is not caused by outermost cutting edges but inner cutting edges. If penetration could be occurred, the inner cutting edges penetrate firstly, then the outermost edges enlarge drilled hole and these sequence can avoid generation of delaminations and burrs.

We set out to construct a computercontrolled tilt table suitable for repeated sinusoidal <b>tilt</b> <b>motion</b> as well as fast, single head-up tilt (HUT). The movement profile of the table was designed to prevent muscle tensing and limit vestibular stimulation. Methods: On the new table, 20 healthy subjects underwent a protocol of fast HUT and sinusoidal <b>tilt</b> <b>motion</b> at 2. 5 tilts per minute. BP was measured non-invasively (Finapres). Time domain dynamic {{response to}} HUT and frequency domain response to sinusoidal tilts were derived from the beat-to-beat BP and from interbeat-interval (IBI) series. Results: <b>Tilt</b> <b>motion</b> did not induce dizziness and was experienced by all subjects as smooth. The systolic BP response to fast HUT correlated mildly with the systolic BP spectral power at the sinusoical tilt frequency (R = 0. 47). The IBI response to fast HUT correlated well with the IBI power at the sinusoidal tilt frequency (R = 0. 74). Discussion. In this study we presented a computer controlled tilt table capable of fast posture change and sinusoidal tilts. An exploratory protocol demonstrated that the table is suitable for obtaining cardiovascular response to posture change for modeling purpose...|$|E

The primary goals of this ongoing post-flight investigation are to quantify decrements in manual control of <b>tilt</b> <b>motion</b> following short-duration spaceflight and to evaluate vibrotactile feedback of tilt as a sensorimotor countermeasure.

30|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of <b>tilt</b> <b>motions</b> implies {{a clue to}} the geometric configuration of a deformation source. Two stations, ONT on the SW flank and FPS on the NE flank, indicate uplift of the summit area, whereas MEA on the NW flank shows subsidence of the summit direction. Such variation of the observed <b>tilt</b> <b>motions</b> may be explained by a non-isotropic source having azimuthal dependence on the surface deformation. Here, because we have only three tilt vectors, a single deformation source with simple configuration should be considered. Simple volumetric sources commonly assumed in the analysis of volcano deformation include spheres, pipes, dikes, and sills (e.g., Lisowski 2007). Although non-volumetric faulting can generate crustal deformation, it is unlikely to continue fault motion up to a few minutes at a shallow depth of a volcano. Among these candidates of simple deformation source, spherical and vertical pipe sources were excluded because these sources produce only axisymmetric surface deformation. Although an inclined pipe source and sill-like source can generate non-axisymmetric deformation, it is difficult to reproduce the reversal polarity of <b>tilting</b> <b>motion</b> at MEA. However, an expanding vertical dike striking in the NW–southeast (SE) direction located under the Pon-Machineshiri crater could explain a spatial pattern of the observed tilt changes including the reverse polarity at MEA. Therefore, we assumed a dike below the crater as the single deformation source and estimated its depth, strike, dip, length, width, and opening by using the grid search approach.|$|R
