2500|$|... 70% of Gujarat's area is {{classified}} as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply. Of the total gross irrigated area, 16–17% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83–84% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, subermersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased <b>tubewell</b> irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has [...] "safe" [...] recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state. The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting {{of a network of}} canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. A one megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land {{does not need to be}} acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of its}} broader {{groundwater}} privatization programme, the Government of Pakistan {{is seeking}} to transfer {{to the private sector}} the management, operation, and maintenance functions of the system of public <b>tubewells</b> (called "SCARPs") which were installed to control waterlogging and salinity. This paper presents a micro level analysis of alternative privatization strategies. linear programming models of representative farms in SCARP I area of Punjab Province were developed to explore the efficiency and equity implications of various transition options. Net benefits of supplemental water available from SCARP <b>tubewells</b> were estimated at about Rs 800 per acre, which are about three times higher than the existing level of O&M expenditure. Even without considering the long-term benefits of waterlogging control, this result implies that the SCARP programme has a high social rate of return. For particular SCARP <b>tubewells</b> which are uneconomical to repair and operate, replacing these <b>tubewells</b> with farmer-owned small <b>tubewells</b> appears likely to improve agricultural productivity and reduce government outlays. Operable SCARP <b>tubewells</b> should be kept in service unless they are replaced by equal or greater alternative pumping capacity in the private sector to prevent waterlogging. Rural institutions should be strengthened to ensure efficient local level groundwater management. ...|$|R

Also, the government was interested in developing new management models beyond pure community management to both mobilise funding and improve the quality and sustainability of service provision.
