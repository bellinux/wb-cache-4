25|$|The obvious {{method is}} {{proportional}} control: the motor current {{is set in}} proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on the down side, but a smaller force if the error is on <b>the</b> <b>upside.</b> That's where the integral and derivative terms play their part.|$|E

25|$|RISC {{designs are}} also more likely to feature a Harvard memory model, where the {{instruction}} stream and the data stream are conceptually separated; this means that modifying the memory where code is held might not have any effect on the instructions executed by the processor (because the CPU has a separate instruction and data cache), at least until a special synchronization instruction is issued. On <b>the</b> <b>upside,</b> this allows both caches to be accessed simultaneously, which can often improve performance.|$|E

25|$|During a {{downside}} regime, {{a large number}} of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in ‘safer’ investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a flight-to-quality effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers {{in a short period of}} time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>upside</b> and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.|$|E

Four shows survived for a second season, but three of them were cancelled in the following year, none were unqualified ratings successes, and the network remained a distant fourth place in total viewership.|$|E

25|$|Art {{historian}} Penny Jolly {{suggests that}} {{in the mid to}} late 1420s Jan may have traveled to Italy {{at the behest of the}} Duke of Burgundy where, in Florence, he probably saw an iconic 14th century annunciation, and perhaps visited more contemporary annunciation scenes. The Florentine annunciations have a number of iconographic similarities to the Ghent panels, including Gabriel's multi-colored wings, <b>the</b> <b>upside</b> down writing, the treatment of light beams, and the separation between angel and virgin by a thin architectural feature. Some of these elements, particularly the spatial separation between the two figures, can be found in Lorenzo Monaco's Bartolini Salimbeni Annunciation in Santa Trinita, finished before his death in 1424, and one that Jan may have seen. In Monaco's painting the angel and Mary are separated by two small spaces, one external and one internal, similar to the city-scape and domestic lavabo panels in the Ghent annunciation.|$|E
