5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form anywhere {{within the}} extratropical {{regions of the}} Earth (usually between 30° and 60° latitude from the equator), either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition. A study of extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere shows <b>that</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 30th and 70th parallels, there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period. A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter.|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows <b>that</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> 9th and 11th centuries {{the area around}} Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may have factored into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E
5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds <b>that</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with <b>that</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian War {{erupted in}} March 1992, {{following}} Bosnia and Hercegovina's {{declaration of independence}} from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In April 1992, Bosnian Serb forces, representing the Republika Srpska and the Yugoslav People's Army, took up positions in the areas surrounding the Bosnian capital Sarajevo and initiated a siege that was to last for four years. The siege was characterized by sniper fire and shelling directed at the city's buildings and infrastructure and at civilian residents of the city. Reports showed <b>that</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the siege and November 1992, an average of eight persons were killed and 44 wounded in Sarajevo per day.|$|E
5|$|The Himalayas {{and other}} {{mountain}} chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions. An estimated 15,000 glaciers {{can be found}} in the greater Himalayas, with double that number in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram and Tien Shan ranges, and comprise the largest glaciated region outside the poles. These glaciers provide critical water supplies to arid countries such as Mongolia, western China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region are experiencing a decline in mass, and researchers claim <b>that</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9percent reduction in ice mass. Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). If the present trends persist the ice mass will gradually be reduced, and will affect the availability of water resources, though water loss is not expected to cause problems for many decades.|$|E
