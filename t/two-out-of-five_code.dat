5000|$|The {{following}} table represents decimal digits from 0 to 9 {{in various}} <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> systems: ...|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> is an m of n {{code that}} {{provides}} exactly ten possible combinations, {{and thus is}} popular for representing decimal digits using five bits. There are ways to assign weights to each bit such that the set bits sum to the desired value, with an exception for zero.|$|E
50|$|The {{limit on}} the number of bits set is similar to, but {{strictly}} stronger than, a parity check. All constant-weight codes, including the <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code,</b> can not only detect any single-bit error, but also detect any unidirectional errors -- any case where all errors in a codeword are of a single type (0→1 or 1→0).|$|E
50|$|Reed relays {{are smaller}} and cheaper, thus {{better suited to}} data storage. They were used in {{conjunction}} with wire spring relays, for example to store digits for sending to other crossbar switching offices. In a multi-frequency sender (the part of a switch which sends routing information about outgoing calls over trunk lines), for example, wire spring relays direct the dialed digits one at a time from reed relay packs to frequency generators, under sequential control of logic implemented with wire spring relays. At the other end, similar relays steered the incoming digits from the tone decoder to a reed relay memory. In such uses <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>codes</b> and similar schemes checked for errors at both ends.|$|R
50|$|The 7070 series {{stored data}} in a 10 decimal digit plus sign word. Digits were encoded using a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code.</b> Characters were {{represented}} by a two-digit code. The machine shipped with 5,000 to 9,990 words of core and the CPU speed was about 27KIPS. A typical system was leased for $17,400 per month or could be purchased for $813,000.|$|E
50|$|A <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> is an {{encoding}} scheme which uses five bits consisting of exactly three 0s and two 1s. This provides ten possible combinations, enough {{to represent the}} digits 0-9. This scheme can detect all single bit-errors, all odd numbered bit-errors and some even numbered bit-errors (for example the flipping of both 1-bits). However it still cannot correct any of these errors.|$|E
5000|$|In the Decimal Architecture IBM 7070, IBM 7072, and IBM 7074 alphamerics are encoded using digit pairs (using <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> in the digits, not BCD) of the 10-digit word, {{with the}} [...] "zone" [...] {{in the left}} digit and the [...] "digit" [...] in the right digit. Input/Output {{translation}} hardware converted between the internal digit pairs and the external standard 6-bit BCD codes.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{individual}} digit {{is represented}} {{by a set of}} five bars, two of which are full bars (i.e. <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code).</b> The full bars represent [...] "on" [...] bits in a pseudo-binary code in which the places represent, from left to right: 7, 4, 2, 1, and 0. (Though in this scheme, zero is encoded as 11 in decimal, or in POSTNET [...] "binary" [...] as 11000.) ...|$|E
50|$|Early {{computers}} that were exclusively decimal include the ENIAC, IBM NORC, IBM 650, IBM 1620, IBM 7070. In these machines the basic unit of data was the decimal digit, encoded {{in one of}} several schemes, including binary-coded decimal or BCD, bi-quinary, excess-3, and <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code.</b> Except for the 1620, these machines used word addressing. When non-numeric characters were used in these machines, they were encoded as two decimal digits.|$|E
50|$|Like POSTNET, PLANET encodes {{the data}} in half- and full-height bars. Also like POSTNET, PLANET always starts and ends with a full bar (often called a guard rail), and each {{individual}} digit is represented {{by a set of}} five bars using a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code.</b> However, in POSTNET, the two bars are full bars; in PLANET, the two-of-five are the short bars. As with POSTNET, the check digit is calculated by summing the other characters and calculating the single digit which, when added to the sum, makes the total divisible by 10.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few million}} reed relays were used from the 1930s to the 1960s for memory {{functions}} in Bell System electromechanical telephone exchanges. Often a multiple-reed relay was used, {{with one of}} the reeds latching the relay, and the other or others performing logic or memory functions. Most reed relays in the crossbar switching systems of the 1940s through the 1970s were packaged in groups of five. Such a [...] "reed pack" [...] was able to store one decimal digit, encoded in a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> (74210 variant) for easy validity checking by wire spring relay logic.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the Bell System {{multi-frequency}} (MF) {{signaling system}} known by CCITT as Regional System R1, it used six signaling frequencies: 700 Hz (A), 900 Hz (B), 1100 Hz (C), 1300 Hz (D), 1500 Hz (E) and 1700 Hz (F). The first five frequencies {{were used in}} a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> to represent decimal numbers (phone numbers), and the last frequency in combination {{with one of the}} others represented the beginning or end of a sequence of digits. These frequencies were combined to encode the following signals (mostly digits): ...|$|E
5000|$|The two wide bars, {{out of five}} {{possible}} positions, encode {{a number}} between 1 and 10 using a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> with the following numeric equivalence: 1, 2, 4, 7, 0. The numbers are summed together. For example, the number 6 is encoded NWWNN, with wide bars occupying the positions for 2 and 4 (2+4=6). In the case of NNWWN which is [...] it is assigned to 0 for digits (+0), and 10 for the letter columns (+10 - +30). When encoding the (+10 to +30) Letters the equation needs a [...] "−1" [...] added so 'A' is WNNNW → 1 + 10 − 1 → 10 {{as shown in the}} table.|$|E
50|$|Some {{systems that}} use tone {{signaling}} require higher reliability and less probability of falsing. One method of reducing falsing uses formats with simultaneous, paired tones. In decoding dual tones such as ICAO's SelCall, Quik Call I, MF, or DTMF, pairs of decoders are used and their outputs {{are connected to}} logical and circuitry. When tones are decoded, they are submitted to the and logic. If both are decoded at the same time, the and logic output shows a decoded pair of tones is present. To false in a dual-tone system, both decoders would have to false at the same moment. <b>Two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> and similar methods provide an additional check in some applications.|$|E
5000|$|ITF encodes {{pairs of}} digits; the first digit is encoded {{in the five}} bars (or black lines), while the second digit is encoded in the five spaces (or white lines) {{interleaved}} with them. Two {{out of every five}} bars or spaces are wide (hence exactly 2 of 5). The digits are encoded to symbols as follows:Where [...] "n" [...] is a narrow line (bar or space) and [...] "W" [...] a wide line (2.0 to 3.0 times the width of a narrow line). The wide lines form a <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> with consecutive values of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 0, where the code 0 has a value of 11. This is similar to the POSTNET bar code.|$|E
5000|$|Connectors, {{similar in}} purpose {{to the data}} buses inside a {{computer}} CPU, connect the markers to the peripheral equipment. each connector {{is made up of}} large relays of 30 contacts each, to connect all the leads by which the marker would exchange information and control signals. For example, each of the oblong reed packs in an OR would have to be connected by five leads through the originating register marker connector to transmit the <b>two-out-of-five</b> <b>code</b> representing one dialed digit. For speed, transfer is entirely parallel, requiring many large relays to connect so many wires. Connectors that respond to a peripheral circuit's request for action are given the name of the requesting circuit and [...] "marker", as in ORMC or IRMC. Connectors whose use was requested by a marker are named only for the circuit to which they connect, as in outsender connector, line link connector, and trouble recorder connector.|$|E
