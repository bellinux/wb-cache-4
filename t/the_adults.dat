5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. <b>The</b> <b>adults</b> use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to <b>the</b> <b>adults,</b> except for undeveloped wings and genitalia.

5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly consumed by <b>the</b> <b>adults.</b> These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E

40|$|Three-year-old {{children}} saw an <b>adult</b> displaying <b>the</b> {{exact same}} distress in 3 different conditions: (a) <b>the</b> <b>adult’s</b> distress was appropriate to a genuine harm, (b) <b>the</b> <b>adult’s</b> distress was an overreaction {{to a minor}} inconvenience, and (c) there was no apparent cause for <b>the</b> <b>adult’s</b> distress. Children who witnessed <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> being appropriately upset showed concern for him, intervened on his behalf, and checked on him when he later expressed distress out of their view. Children {{who did not know}} the cause for <b>the</b> <b>adult’s</b> distress responded similarly. In contrast, children who witnessed <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> overreacting to an inconve-nience showed lower rates of intervening and checking. The degree of children’s concern across conditions was correlated with the latency of their helping behavior toward <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> later. These results suggest that from an early age, young children’s sympathy and prosocial behavior are not automatic responses to emotional displays but, rather, involve taking into account whether the displayed distress is justified...|$|R

5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
