5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>Scandal.</b>|$|E

Controversial political subjects such as <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal,</b> the Savings and Loan crisis, the AIDS epidemic, and the Kennedy Assassination, as well as true crime accounts of serial killers, mass murderers, the mafia, and organized crime were covered in these card sets. Yronwode was widely interviewed in the media about her role in their creation.|$|E
25|$|During the Reagan presidency, he {{secured the}} {{purchase}} of AWACs surveillance aircraft despite opposition from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. After the United States rejected an arms order, he arranged the delivery of intermediate-range nuclear-warhead-capable missiles from China. This angered the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Department of State. He was exposed for his involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal.</b> He had arranged $32 million in Saudi financing for the Nicaraguan Contras. Nancy Reagan used him to relay messages to the Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|In the 1984 presidential {{election}} the Democrats had nominated Walter Mondale, a traditional New Deal-type liberal as their candidate. When Mondale {{was defeated in}} a landslide, party leaders became eager {{to find a new}} approach {{to get away from the}} 1980 and 1984 debacles. After Bush's image was affected by his involvement on <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal</b> much more than Reagan's, and after the Democrats won back control of the U.S. Senate in the 1986 congressional elections following an economic downturn, the party's leaders felt more optimistic about having a closer race with the GOP in 1988, although probabilities from winning the presidency were still marginal with the contemporary climate of prosperity.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{relations}} between Noriega and the United States began to deteriorate. In 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan opened negotiations with General Noriega, requesting that the Panamanian leader step down {{after he was}} publicly exposed in The New York Times by Seymour Hersh, and later exposed in <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Scandal.</b> Reagan pressured him with several drug-related indictments in U.S. courts; however, since extradition laws between Panama and the U.S. were weak, Noriega deemed this threat not credible and did not submit to Reagan's demands. In 1988, Elliot Abrams {{and others in the}} Pentagon began pushing for a U.S. invasion, but Reagan refused, due to Bush's ties to Noriega through his previous positions in the CIA and the Task Force on Drugs, and their potentially negative impact on Bush's presidential campaign. Later negotiations involved dropping the drug-trafficking indictments. In March 1988, Noriega's forces resisted an attempted coup against the government of Panama. As relations continued to deteriorate, Noriega appeared to shift his Cold War allegiance towards the Soviet bloc, soliciting and receiving military aid from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Libya. American military planners began preparing contingency plans to invade Panama.|$|E
500|$|The Iran–Contra affair ( [...] , [...] ), also {{referred}} to as Irangate, Contragate or <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>scandal,</b> was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration. Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo. They hoped, thereby, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua {{while at the same time}} negotiating the release of several U.S. hostages. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress.|$|E
50|$|Director of Central Intelligence William Webster {{formally}} reprimanded Allen {{for failing}} to fully comply with the DCI's request for full cooperation in <b>the</b> agency's internal <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal</b> investigation.

50|$|In 1994, Cutler and co-director/producer David Van Taylor spent eleven months {{following}} the U.S. Senate campaign of Lt. Col. Oliver North who was running as a Republican to take the seat occupied by Democrat Charles S. Robb. North had risen to prominence as the key figure in <b>the</b> Reagan-era <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal.</b> <b>The</b> cinema verite film they made, A Perfect Candidate, featured access to both the North and Robb campaigns and told stories about non-candidates as well, including North strategist Mark Goodin, Washington Post reporters Don Baker and Peter Baker and Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter Mike Allen. A Perfect Candidate premiered at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival in April 1996 and was released theatrically by Seventh Art Releasing on June 19, 1996.|$|R
50|$|Oliver North {{was a very}} {{controversial}} figure as {{he was involved in}} <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> Affair, a <b>scandal</b> during Ronald Reagan's presidency. Marshall Coleman attempted to seize the middle ground between Robb and North. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia endorsed Marshall Coleman. On the eve of the election, former first lady Nancy Reagan told a reporter that North had lied to her husband when discussing <b>Iran-Contra</b> with <b>the</b> former president, effectively eviscerating him. North's candidacy was documented in the 1996 film A Perfect Candidate.|$|R
500|$|The {{criminal}} defense attorney Barry William Levine, a partner at Hastert's former firm of Dickstein Shapiro, appeared as Hastert's lawyer on a notice of arraignment filed with the U.S. district court. However, Levine did not enter an appearance on Hastert's behalf. [...] Hastert subsequently hired attorney Thomas C. Green to provide his legal defense. Green entered an appearance with the court on June 8, {{the day before the}} arraignment. Green is a white-collar {{criminal defense}} lawyer and senior counsel at the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Sidley Austin. Green has represented clients in several national controversies, including several government officials in the Whitewater scandal, Richard V. Secord in <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal,</b> and Robert Mardian in the Watergate scandal.|$|E
2500|$|As {{other presidents}} have done, Bush issued {{a series of}} pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted {{executive}} clemency to six former government employees implicated in <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal</b> of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a [...] "true American patriot".|$|E
2500|$|In late April 1987, The Miami Herald {{claimed that}} an {{anonymous}} informant contacted {{the paper to}} relate that Hart {{was having an affair}} with a friend, claimed it was the equivalent of <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>scandal,</b> provided details about the affair, and told the Herald that Hart was going to meet this person at his Washington, D.C., townhouse on May 1. As a result, a team of Herald reporters followed Donna Rice on a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., then staked out Hart's townhouse that evening and the next Saturday, and observed a young woman and Hart together. [...] The Herald reporters confronted Hart on Saturday evening in an alley about his relationship with Rice. [...] Hart replied, [...] "I'm not involved in any relationship.” and alleged that he had been set up.|$|E
5000|$|Webster {{came from}} a legal background, {{including}} serving as a Federal judge and as the Director of the FBI. He was expected, with this background, to clear out all legal irregularities at CIA. Repercussions from <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> arms smuggling <b>scandal</b> included {{the creation of the}} Intelligence Authorization Act in 1991. It defined covert operations as secret missions in geopolitical areas where the United States is neither openly nor apparently engaged. This also required an authorizing chain of command, including an official, Presidential finding report, and the informing of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which, in emergencies, requires only [...] "timely notification".|$|R

50|$|In April 2008 Vanity Fair {{published}} “The Gaza Bombshell”: ”There is no {{one more}} hated among Hamas members than Muhammad Dahlan, long Fatah’s resident strongman in Gaza. Dahlan, who most recently served as Abbas’s national-security adviser, {{has spent more than}} a decade battling Hamas. … Bush has met Dahlan on at least three occasions. After talks at the White House in July 2003, Bush publicly praised Dahlan as “a good, solid leader.” In private, say multiple Israeli and American officials, the U.S. president described him as “our guy.”Vanity Fair has obtained confidential documents, since corroborated by sources in the U.S. and Palestine, which lay bare a covert initiative, approved by Bush and implemented by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Deputy National Security Adviser Elliott Abrams, to provoke a Palestinian civil war. The plan was for forces led by Dahlan, and armed with new weapons supplied at America’s behest, to give Fatah the muscle it needed to remove the democratically elected Hamas-led government from power. (The State Department declined to comment.)Some sources call the scheme “Iran-contra 2.0,” recalling that Abrams was convicted (and later pardoned) for withholding information from Congress during <b>the</b> original <b>Iran-contra</b> <b>scandal</b> under President Reagan. There are echoes of other past misadventures as well: the C.I.A.’s 1953 ouster of an elected prime minister in Iran, which {{set the stage for the}} 1979 Islamic revolution there; the aborted 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, which gave Fidel Castro an excuse to solidify his hold on Cuba; and the contemporary tragedy in Iraq.|$|R
2500|$|In 1987, Saturday Night Live aired {{an opening}} sketch entitled, [...] "The New Charlie's Angels". The [...] "new Angels" [...] were Jessica Hahn (whose affair with {{televangelist}} Jim Bakker had brought down his ministry), Fawn Hall (secretary to Oliver North during <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Scandal),</b> and Donna Rice (whose alleged affair with former Senator Gary Hart had ended his presidential candidacy). In the sketch, a mysterious man named [...] "Charlie" [...] was directing the [...] "Angels" [...] to cause these scandals, {{in order to}} eliminate presidential candidates.

2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>scandal,</b> Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E
