Results the analysis and grouping of transaction costs of controlling activities of the territorial taxation bodies have been carried out.

40|$|Abstract. Reliable data {{transmission}} protocols between a sender and a receiver often use feedback from receiver to sender to acknowledge correct data delivery. Such feedback is typically sent as <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> by receiver nodes. Since sending of <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> involves communication overhead, many protocols rely on aggregating {{a number of}} <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> and sending them together as a single packet over the network. On the other hand, the delays in the transmission of <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> may reduce the rate of {{data transmission}} from the sender. Thus, there is a basic tradeoff between the communication cost of <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> {{and the effect of}} delaying them. We develop a rigorous framework to study the aggregation of control packets for multicast and other hierarchical network protocols. We define the multicast aggregation problem and design efficient online algorithms for it, both centralized and distributed. ...|$|R

The signaling overhead of the ICMP echo scheme is very low. The ICMP destination-unreachable scheme also needs few <b>control</b> <b>messages.</b> Moreover, the macrodomain handoffs happen infrequently. It seems that these <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> are unlikely to impose serious overhead to the involved domains.|$|R

Moreover, as has been explained before, bot traffic tends to be stealthy. Hence, bot conversations {{are expected to have}} higher inter-arrival time of packets than benign P 2 P conversations.|$|R

Numerous enhancements to existing routing protocols to reduce the overhead caused by <b>control</b> <b>messages</b> have been proposed. Most of them use complex algorithms or keep track of previous messages. Due to the complexity and sometimes requirements for special hardware or information sources, none of these extensions are widely used. Therefore, we propose two extensions which are simple to implement yet provide significant overhead reduction for typical <b>control</b> <b>messages.</b> The first extension removes unnecessary bytes and redundancy from <b>control</b> <b>messages.</b> The second extension introduces smaller messages sent as replacements when the information did not change since the last message. Both extensions can be used in parallel or individually, providing a good amount of overhead reduction while being simple to implement and integrate...|$|R
