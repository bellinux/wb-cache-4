[...] The first, she wrote, incorrectly posits {{that the state}} privileges [...] "procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people". Rather [...] "Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married." [...] The misconception that [...] "'marriage is procreation'", she wrote, [...] "confers an official stamp of approval on the destructive stereotype that same-sex relationships are inherently unstable and inferior to opposite-sex relationships and are not worthy of respect." [...] The second, the marriage {{of a man and}} a woman as the [...] "optimal setting for child rearing", a claim she said many Massachusetts statutes and the notion of [...] "the best interests of the child" [...] refuted, she found irrelevant, in that denying marriage licenses to one class of persons does not affect the marriage patterns of the other class. She turned the argument against the DPH: [...] "the task of child rearing for same-sex couples is made infinitely harder by their status as outliers to the marriage laws." [...] She concluded that [...] "It cannot be rational under our laws, and indeed it is not permitted, to penalize children by depriving them of State benefits because the State disapproves of their parents' sexual orientation." [...] She dismissed the third rationale as an unjustified generalization about the economic interdependence of same-sex partners. Later in the opinion she summarized this analysis, saying the DPH's arguments were [...] "starkly at odds with <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>network</b> of vigorous, gender-neutral laws promoting stable families and the best interests of children." ...|$|E

Even though ORW is a prominent opportunistic routing protocol, it does not consider the heterogeneous duty cycles and especially the network throughput in its routing metric. EoR [4] is another opportunistic routing protocol recently proposed for heterogeneously duty-cycled sensornets, aimed at further reducing the path delay. The authors of EoR preliminarily illustrated the inadequateness of ORW with heterogenous duty cycles; EoR only achieves the path delay performance slightly better than ORW. In sensornets with heterogeneous duty cycles, the heterogeneity of duty cycles and unreliable links collectively impact the network performance in terms of path delay, delivery ratio, and energy efficiency, in a sophisticated way. Then, designing opportunistic forwarding policy to improve <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>network</b> performance is literally a critical challenge in such sensornets.|$|E

Such action should be focused on development and policy issues that enable the network to fully satisfy the communication needs of the United States. Important technological and social trends since IEEE-USA’s earlier policy position on this subject 1 have driven a dramatic increase in traffic as measured by the number of users and the volume of traffic per user.

As a result, mammals experience permanent deficiencies in hearing and balance once their inner ear hair cells are lost. The mechanisms of hair cell regeneration are poorly understood. Because the inner ear sensory epithelium is highly conserved in all vertebrates (Fritzsch et al., 2007), we chose to study hair cell regeneration mechanism in adult zebrafish, hoping the results would be transferrable to inducing hair cell regeneration in mammals.

40|$|Abstract Homocysteine is an {{independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. It is also known {{to be associated with}} a variety of complex disorders. While there are a large number of independent studies implicating homocysteine in isolated pathways, the mechanism of homocysteine induced adverse effects are not clear. Homocysteine-induced modulation of gene expression through alteration of methylation status or by hitherto unknown mechanisms is predicted to lead to several pathological conditions either directly or indirectly. In the present manuscript, using literature mining approach, we have identified the genes that are modulated directly or indirectly by an elevated level of homocysteine. These genes were then placed in appropriate pathways in an attempt to understand the molecular basis of homocysteine induced complex disorders and to provide a resource for selection of genes for polymorphism screening and analysis of mutations as well as epigenetic modifications in relation to hyperhomocysteinemia. We have identified 135 genes in 1137 abstracts that either modulate the levels of homocysteine or are modulated by elevated levels of homocysteine. Mapping the genes to their respective pathways revealed that an elevated level of homocysteine leads to the atherosclerosis either by directly affecting lipid metabolism and transport or via oxidative stress and/or Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. Elevated levels of homocysteine also decreases the bioavailability of nitric oxide and modulates the levels of other metabolites including S-adenosyl methionine and S-adenosyl homocysteine which may result in cardiovascular or neurological disorders. The ER stress emerges as the common pathway that relates to apoptosis, atherosclerosis and neurological disorders and is modulated by levels of homocysteine. <b>The</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>network</b> collated has lead to the identification of genes that are modulated by homocysteine indicating that homocysteine exerts its effect not only through modulating the substrate levels for various catalytic processes but also through regulation of expression of genes involved in complex diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gene fusions are hybrid genes {{formed when}} two dis-crete genes are {{incorrectly}} joined together. Gene fusions {{are found to}} play roles in tumorigenesis. For example, the fusion gene BCR-ABL translates into an abnormal tyrosine kinase that accelerates development of chronic myelogenous leukemia [1]. A network is a relational representation of nodes (e. g., genes) with edges, and is a useful approach to explore biological interactions among many related nodes. Network analysis of gene fusions in cancer would aid the exploration of gene fusion occurrence and association with tumorigenesis. Hoglund et al [2] performed an initial investigation of gene fusions network after collecting 291 tumorigenesis related gene fusions from the Mitelman database in 2006. Since then, gene fusion data has exponentially increased. There is no current and comprehensive can-cer-related gene fusion network to assist in targeting cancer-associated genes. Materials and methods We mined three public databases for cancer-related gene fusion sequences, and one database for fusions records from cancer studies, transcriptome analysis, and genetic disorders. Specifically, we processed each dataset by removing incomplete entries and then extracted gene-fusion pairs. Genes serve as the nodes in the net-work and each fusion pair is joined by an edge. Repeat-ing pairs were represented once. We used Cytoscape to build five networks: one for each dataset and the fifth that encompasses all datasets. We graphed the occur-rence of degree in each single dataset network to deter-mine an empirical definition for hub genes. Results <b>The</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>network</b> includes 9852 genes, displays 12, 791 relationships, and highlights 1248 hub genes.

40|$|AbstractAll Member States of the European Union have to {{contribute}} to the development of Trans-European Networks (TEN). This has been determined in the EU Treaty. National networks should be developed into one European network, supported by the TEN policy. For transport this policy has been laid down in Regulation (EU) No. 1315 / 20131 for the Trans-European transport network. This paper will show the criteria to determine if and when sections of TEN-T network meet the requirements of the TEN-T Regulation with present policies. In the paper we will also address the process that has been ongoing since the beginning of 2014 in which member states, the Commission, consultants and different advisory boards have participated. In this paper we deal with the opportunities and risk for member states and possible ways of enforcement to attain the goal of completion of the TEN-T. The requirements across the EU, especially with regard to the core network, contribute to the quality of the transport infrastructure in the EU reaching a higher level. Modern, more efficient hinterland connections are important to the European economy. Furthermore the requirements aim at a higher percentage of sustainable transport. It is also important that requirements are set for <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>network</b> in the long term. Because 2050 is set so far in the future, the risk is that not much progress will be made in that direction in the coming decennium. With differences in infrastructure planning schemes within the EU this risk is imminent. On the one hand the Regulation offers Member States flexibility for implementation. On the other hand there is a risk that this will result in a system that is not interoperable. It is important to keep an eye on how EU countries deal with the requirements set by the Regulation on one and the same corridor. If infrastructure is not adapted to the requirements set by the Regulation, or not adapted in time, the European Commission can start up a procedure against Member States that can lead to a European Court case and to a conviction. Finally, it is important to note that the network is not defined for all eternity. Adaptations are possible if, based on Eurostat, it appears that the required volumes have not been reached after a number of years. An evaluation will take place of the core network taking into consideration national implementation plans and future extensions. For each corridor a Final report in the form of a work plan was produced In the process with the member states that covered the whole year of 2014. The Final Report provides a summary of the results of the Corridor Analysis with the characteristics of multimodal transport infrastructure as well as the market-related transport flows, the corridor development objectives and the implementation schedule. It also comprises all project information provided and coordinated with the Member States.

40|$|As part of {{the public}} health system in Australia and internationally, the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) setting is a small, specialised, and unique {{environment}} &ndash; sharing the developmental context of paediatric health and the clinical mental health service delivery domains with adult and aged person&rsquo;s psychiatric services (Kelvin, 2005; Ford, 2007). CAMHS services are grappling with a set of expectations imposed by a stressed social welfare system to manage the sequelae of extreme trauma, challenging behaviour and the impact of family violence and trauma on children and adolescents in their care (Wolpert et al., 2014; Bor et al., 2014). CAMHS settings are subject to a pervasive set of expectations emerging from elected government regimes linked with the voting community regarding accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The rise of the transparency and accountability agenda within the public sector has been documented extensively (Armstrong, 2005; Gaventa &amp; McGee, 2013; Van Belle &amp; Mayhew, 2016). In such a paradigm, accountability is neatly and simplistically measured by the articulation of the task of the organisation and the application of metrics to assess performance against that task. The current study aimed to explore and better understand differences in assumptions, perceptions, and experiences of the organisation of public Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Further, the implications these differences have for clinical care, management, and leadership within the organisation itself but also for government in its performance-monitoring role of CAMHS services more broadly are also examined and described. The current study sought to highlight individual perspectives and experiences as they relate to measuring organisational performance beyond finance, activity, and outcomes towards sustainability, process, emotional climate, culture, and organisational dynamics. Thus, the current study aimed to critically review current frameworks for measuring organisational performance and, through analyses of theoretical constructs and qualitative methodologies, to explore experiences, processes, and meaning. A framework is then proposed for considering organisational performance in public CAMHS that takes account of these new meanings and proposes the measurement of organisational performance across a range of domains. The focus of interest was in what personal experience might convey about broader shared issues and themes at an organisational level, and the key data collection tool used was semi-structured in-depth interviews. To elicit data on personal experience, participants who were stakeholders of CAMHS as clients, families, referrers, clinicians, managers, policy leaders, and collaborative partners were the focus of sampling. The data was initially segmented and filtered across broad themes and then coded and gathered into more detailed categories. Themes emerged relating to the expectations and impressions of CAMHS, the clients themselves and their stories of complexity and trauma, the experience of CAMHS clinicians, barriers to accessing services, the experience of services provided once &lsquo;in&rsquo; the system, issues related to the interface between CAMHS and other services and stakeholders, and impressions on what factors might make a &lsquo;good&rsquo; CAMHS. Overall, the findings underlined the view that CAMHS services should take an integrated multi-theoretical perspective, support wisdom in leadership, be accessible, and have sophisticated collaborative capacity. Furthermore a theme of shared power in decision making across a team including children, young people and their families, and other services emerged. Overall the findings are indicative of the fact that a performance framework that adequately addresses these complexities works against the risk that authenticity is lost when measures of organisational performance are reduced to one or two examples. Recommendations for a performance framework for CAMHS are proposed. This includes a robust synthesis of the policy environment, a developmental lens across infant, child, adolescent and youth age groups, a clear definition of the primary task for CAMHS along with an understanding of the target client group, directly addressing the broadly conflicted interface between CAMHS and child protection services, attending to the organisational climate within CAMHS, and defining appropriate accountability measures. Future research must focus on defining the target group for CAMHS, the best and most efficacious treatment models and clients experience of care. It is further recommended that future research explore models for understanding and leading or managing the unique organisational climate in CAMHS settings and particularly on the roles of clinical staff and leaders in the CAMHS settings. A particular area of focus should be in relation to the inherent stress of working in this setting, noting that this is not seen as weakness or poor performance, but rather as a a natural consequence of engagement in the task. A key strength of the current study was that it sought to highlight individual perspectives and experiences as they related to measuring organisational performance and to explicitly place the roles and perspective of the researcher into this frame. The focus of interest was in what personal experience might convey about broader shared issues and themes at an organisational level. In terms of limitations, the most significant was the fact that no child informants could be sourced, and that the time frame and design limited the number of participants and therefore possible perspectives. The qualitative research design did not use a mixed methods model to confirm findings and the generalizability is thought to be limited. The narrow theoretical lens for the research may be also considered a limitation (Chowdery, 2017). However, the theoretical model was chosen carefully as a sound platform on which to consider the complex issues presented from an organisational perspective. In summary, the thesis seeks to make recommendations for a performance framework for CAMHS, and in doing so the author has sought to draw together the key elements emerging from the findings supported by the research community. If <b>the</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>network</b> of elements identified in the current thesis were all adequately addressed, it would have the potential to reliably bind public child and adolescent mental health services with a unique clarity of purpose in a community of care for children, adolescents, and their families...|$|E
