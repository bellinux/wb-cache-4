5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties {{and their}} {{subjects}} have at times been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties approached absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with their subjects and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E

None of these hypotheses can satisfactorily account for the length and temporal gradient of alcoholic amnesics retrograde amnesia. Although some evidence points towards the hypothesis that anterograde and retrograde amnesia might result from separate and independent impairments, this view is presently unproven and leaves open what causes the form and duration of Korsakoffs retrograde amnesia...|$|R

The song's hook is a repeating guitar arpeggio using a delay effect, played during the song's introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is possible to identify a person's religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast.

500|$|Richard Wasson, {{professor}} of English, {{has said that}} The Green Child is [...] "defiant of classification", complicated by its division into [...] "three arbitrarily related sections". The {{first part of the}} novel adopts the style of a 19th-century Gothic fairy tale. The [...] "fluid, seemingly unbroken hand" [...] in which it is written has encouraged <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was produced in a single sitting, followed by a break before the second part was begun. Part two is written as a [...] "conventional political adventure", in which Olivero tells in flashback the story of his rise to power as the dictator of Roncador. The final part of the novel continues the narrative where the first left off, in the [...] "fantastical, subterranean world of the Green people". So different in style is the first part from what follows that some critics regard it as an entirely separate work, or [...] "the 'true' novel".|$|E
40|$|During {{the next}} Praat-groep meeting, I will {{contribute}} to <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not just about what you say, but also about how you say it. The focus here is on one particular aspect of speech performance, namely the (dis) fluency of speech. I will present results from two eye-tracking experiments targeting the effect that disfluencies may have on the predictive mechanisms of the listener. I will demonstrate that disfluencies may lead listeners to predict a more complex referent (relative to fluent speech). However, when participants listened to a non-native speaker, no effect of disfluency could be established. These two experiments show that (i) listeners {{are sensitive to the}} fluency of speech, and (ii) listeners are flexible in modulating the use of disfluencies based on speaker knowledge...|$|R

500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned on <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev, which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during {{the decline of the}} Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E

50|$|Since it was {{impossible}} to know who was predestined, <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> developed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might be possible to discern that a person was elect (predestined) by observing their way of life.

40|$|Where possible, {{automation}} {{has been}} a common response of humankind to many activities {{that have to be}} repeated numerous times. The routine identification of specimens of previously described species has many of the characteristics of other activities that have been automated, and poses a major constraint on studies in many areas of both pure and applied biology. In this paper, we consider some of the reasons why automated species identification has not become widely employed, and whether it is a realistic option, addressing <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is too difficult, too threatening, too different or too costly. Although recognizing that there are some very real technical obstacles yet to be overcome, we argue that progress in the development of automated species identification is extremely encouraging that such an approach has the potential to make a valuable contribution to reducing the burden of routine identifications. Vision and enterprise are perhaps more limiting at present than practical constraints on what might possibly be achieved...|$|R

2500|$|The Kübler-Ross model, {{commonly}} known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book, On Death and Dying.

[...] Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill and it was not until much later in her career did she give into <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be applied to those grieving. [...] She once remarked that it's hard to deny that a loved one has died, but easier to deny that you, in fact, are terminally ill. [...] The popular but largely untested theory describes in five distinct stages how people deal with grief and tragedy. Such events might include being diagnosed with a terminal illness or enduring a catastrophic loss.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Raynal's influence, Toussaint Louverture {{was a key}} Enlightened actor in the Haitian Revolution. Enlightened thought divided the world into [...] "enlightened leaders" [...] and [...] "ignorant masses"; Louverture attempted to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the enlightened few. Louverture was familiar with Enlightenment ideas {{within the context of}} European imperialism. He attempted {{to strike a balance between}} Western Enlightened thought as a necessary means of winning liberation, and not propagating <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge of people of color on Saint Domingue. As an extension of himself and his Enlightened education, Louverture wrote a Constitution for a new society in Saint-Domingue that abolished slavery. The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars. Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution. In addition, Louverture exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style, language and accent of this text.|$|E
2500|$|The Plague of Justinian is {{generally}} regarded as the first recorded instance of bubonic plague. This conclusion {{is based on the}} historical description of the clinical manifestations during the epidemic [...] and the detection of Y. pestis DNA from human remains at ancient grave sites dated to that period. A genetic study of the bacterium causing bubonic plague based on samples taken from the remains of 14th-century plague victims in London and a survey of other samples suggests that the Plague of Justinian and others from antiquity arose from either now-extinct strains of Yersinia pestis genetically distinct from the 14th-century strain or came from pathogens entirely unrelated to bubonic plague. However, further work by the same researchers noted that the spread of several unusual modern variants of plague worldwide can be dated to an evolutionary radiation event approximately coinciding with the Plague of Justinian, supporting <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was caused by a strain of bubonic plague.|$|E
2500|$|During Wolfowitz's pre-war {{testimony}} before Congress, he dismissed General Eric K. Shinseki's {{estimates of the}} size of the post war occupation force which would be needed. General Shinseki testified to the US Senate Armed Services Committee on February 25, 2003 that [...] "something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" [...] would probably be required for postwar Iraq. [...] By contrast, Wolfowitz estimated that fewer than 100,000 troops would be necessary in Iraq. Two days after Shinseki testified, Wolfowitz said to the House Budget Committee on February 27, 2003:There has been a good deal of comment—some of it quite outlandish—about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq. Some of the higher end predictions we have been hearing recently, such as <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark. It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam's security forces and his army—hard to imagine.|$|E
