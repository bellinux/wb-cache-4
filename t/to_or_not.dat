25|$|After the {{issuance}} of Spain's Alhambra Decree in 1492, {{a large proportion of}} the unconverted Jews chose exile rather than conversion, many of them crossing the border to Portugal. In Portugal, however, the Jews were again issued with a similar decree just a few years later in 1497, giving them the choice of exile or conversion. Unlike in Spain, however, in actual practice Portugal mostly prevented them from leaving, thus they necessarily stayed as ostensible converts to Christianity whether they wished <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> after the Portuguese King reasoned that by their failure to leave they accepted Christianity by default. For this reason, crypto-Judaism was far more prevalent in Portugal than in Spain, even though many of these families were originally of Spanish rather than Portuguese descent.|$|E

The pre-chorus states [...] "However, at this moment, bruised egos ask with a voice". He is asking that she decide because he has grown tired of her games and of worrying at nights.

2500|$|Rouvas {{returned}} to Greece, ready to re-launch his career, {{and started to}} look for a new record deal after his record company (Universal Music - Polygram at that time)didn't seem to be in favour of a new released album. [...] Makis Matsas,CEO of Minos-Emi Greece along with one of his A manager, Vangelis Yannopoulos, take the odds and signed the artist. [...] The first difficulty that Vangelis Yannopoulos had in front of him was to convince composers and lyricists to work on Sakis Rouvas' new release. [...] Well-known composer Phoebus was approached and declined. [...] Then came the idea to fight back the Cypriot problem with a ... Cypriot composer. [...] Vangelis worked a lot in that period with Giorgos Theofanous whom he had produced some golden albums with (Evridiki). [...] After having obtained the [...] "go on", he then turned to another Vangelis (Konstantinidis), a well-known lyricist he had also worked with on other golden albums by proeminent Greek artists (Dantis, Stefanos Korkolis, etc.). Konstantinidis was hesitant due to the negative image that had been associated with Rouvas and delayed his response. Konstantinidis stated that Yannopoulos had called him for a final time and asked [...] "Do you want <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> Vangeli?", which the lyricist claimed was the inspiration for his first hit with Rouvas. Rouvas' collaboration with Konstantinidis would continue on to future albums (with songs like [...] "Andexa" [...] - an hymn and another production of Vangelis Yannopoulos, and composed by newcomer Stratos Diamandis - a sound engineer assistant on this single), also achieving success, while the release of the single would begin his collaboration with rock/folk singer Stelios Rokkos, who wrote the song [...] "Tha Mou Pari Kairo". Rokkos came to work for this album as a good friend of Sakis, and declared himself to be a big supporter of Rouvas, as he constantly promoted him during his time of receiving very harsh treatment by the media.|$|E
2500|$|Peña Nieto, however, {{said in a}} {{news conference}} that he can ease the waves of {{violence}} in Mexican Drug War by redirecting the focus of the military approach carried out by Mexico's current president, Felipe Calderón. Instead of focusing primarily on taking down the heads of the criminal organizations and the most-wanted drug lords of the cartels, he proposes to use government resources to put down homicides, kidnappings, and extortions—crimes that do the most damage to the Mexican people—by flooding troops and police into places with the highest rates of violence crimes. Peña Nieto, however, said that his proposal {{does not mean that the}} government will not tackle other crimes nor prevent drug trafficking, but rather noted that arresting drug bosses will no longer be the focus of his administration. Opponents of Peña Nieto have said that the PRI's return will mean the going back to the [...] "old PRI model" [...] of making deals with the cartels. Nonetheless, the presidential candidate has praised Calderón's decision of sending in troops to fight the cartels, and has emphasized plans to increase the military presence in areas most effected by drug-related violence, like Monterrey and Veracruz. The security policy of Peña Nieto does not say that it will stop fighting the drug cartels; it proposes that it will simply shift away from targeting the heads of the cartels. This redirection is a response to the criticism made by critics to Calderón for targeting a few main cartels and splitting them up into smaller and more violent factions. Peña Nieto's strategy would align with a new strain of thinking for the general public, which calls for law enforcement in both the United States and Mexico to make the reduction of violence, kidnappings, and extortion their overwhelming focus in the War on Drugs. According to Reuters, other experts argue that Mexico's criminal groups do not have to be provoked and often ambush Mexico's security forces when they are on patrol, and that the cartels have become so violent that the Mexican government will have no other option but to keep battling them – whether they want <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
