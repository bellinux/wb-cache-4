He says that keeping communication channels open and clear between {{parents and their children}} will help address bullying issues. He commented that he hopes the poem and the project will promote a connectivity between those who have suffered from bullying, that they might feel less isolated. The project aims to help schools engage better with bullying and child suicide.|$|E
500|$|... : A gambler meets a tengu, {{who asks}} {{him what he}} is most frightened of. The gambler lies, {{claiming}} that he is terrified of gold or mochi. The tengu answers truthfully that he is frightened {{of a kind of}} plant or some other mundane item. The tengu, thinking he is playing a cruel trick, then causes money or rice cakes to rain down on the gambler. The gambler is of course delighted and proceeds to scare the tengu away with <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> fears most. The gambler then obtains the tengu's magic gourd (or another treasured item) that was left behind.|$|E

A writer for the New York Post noted that following his identification, Wright sat [...] "with a lurch which told better than anything else the cost in strength to him of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had done."

The conviction was overturned. In December 1996, the same Court of Appeals ruled {{that some of the}} jurors in the federal case might have been influenced by their knowledge and discussion {{of the results of the}} state case, and threw out the federal conviction. Keating was freed after 4½ years in prison; he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> was proudest of. He was said to have gotten along well with other prisoners and served as best man at weddings for some that he met there.|$|E
500|$|Manson {{described}} Holy Wood as a [...] "declaration of war." [...] The album's plot is a parable, {{which he}} told Rolling Stone was semi-autobiographical. While {{it can be}} viewed on several levels, he said its simplest interpretation is {{to see it as}} a story about an idealistic man whose revolution is commercialized, leading him to [...] "destroy <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> has created, which is himself." [...] It takes place in a thinly-veiled satire of modern America called [...] "Holy Wood", which Manson described as a Disneyesque, city-sized amusement park where the main attractions are death and violence. Its literary foil is [...] "Death Valley", which is used as a [...] "metaphor for the outcast and the imperfect of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher said Fight Club was {{a coming}} of age film, like the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher {{described}} the Narrator as an [...] "everyman"; the character is identified in the script as [...] "Jack", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: [...] "He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried {{to fit into the}} world by becoming <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> isn't." [...] The Narrator cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must [...] "kill" [...] his parents, his god, and his teacher. At the start of the film, he has [...] "killed off" [...] his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to [...] "kill off" [...] his teacher, Tyler Durden.|$|E

500|$|... "Imprisoned {{with the}} Pharaohs" [...] {{has been cited}} as an early {{influence}} on Robert Bloch, which is particularly evident in his tale [...] "Fane of the Black Pharaoh". Although Lovecraft himself refers to the real sphinx as a god of the dead, Bloch expanded upon the mythos and claimed that the sphinx in [...] "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" [...] was actually Nyarlathotep, an Outer God and Lovecraft creation. The idea of a twist ending, where a terrible discovery is made worse by the realization {{that it is only}} part of a larger horror, was used again in [...] "The Shunned House", written later that year. In this tale, the protagonist digs into the cellar of the eponymous dwelling only to find that <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> believed to be the monster of the tale is only the beast's elbow. The text of [...] "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs", like many of Lovecraft's works, is in the public domain and can be found in several compilations of the author's work {{as well as on the}} Internet.|$|E
500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in {{the seaside}} village of Berneval-le-Grand in {{northern}} France, where he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating {{the execution of}} Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity; it moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners as a whole. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them, but rather the poem highlights the brutalisation of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line [...] "Yet each man kills <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> loves". Wilde too was separated from his wife and sons. He adopted the proletarian ballad form, and the author was credited as [...] "C33", Wilde's cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in Reynolds' Magazine, [...] "because it circulates widely among the criminal classes– to which I now belong– for once I will be read by my peers– a new experience for me". It was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions {{in less than two}} years, only after which [...] "" [...] was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author. It brought him a little money.|$|E

500|$|Wesley Strick was {{initially}} hired to pen a script {{for a new}} Nightmare on Elm Street, after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film Seven; the film was never produced. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production. When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer, and which still [...] "needed to be tinkered with". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into [...] " [...] as a person [...] how he became <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> was". Bayer expressed that, unlike the Friday the 13th remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the Nightmare remake is coming straight from the first film. At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing Guitar Hero. Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated. To him, if someone watched the film five years later, and Guitar Hero was not as popular as it once was, it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing. At the same time, they wanted the film to feel relevant, and including things like the Internet, mobile phones, and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effort of}} {{creating}} such a monumental pictureRoberts nicknamed it [...] "The Big Picture"took {{its toll on}} the artist. Nicknamed [...] "Bulldog", he drew {{a picture of a}} bulldog escaping a collar and chain in a letter he wrote informing that the picture was near completion. He described the painting once as his [...] "Frankenstein of 17 feet." [...] Roberts's eyesight was weakened by the strain in representing so many likenesses accurately and the importance that he placed on the task sapped his strength. The biographer Humphrey McQueen claims the picture gave Roberts [...] "an inflated idea of [...] own importance". However, Roberts never established himself as an artist in England and slipped into depression. The completion of the painting is generally seen as a turning point in his artistic career, after which his work never again reached the same heights. Roberts family reject this consensus as a [...] "myth", with his great-granddaughter, artist Lisa Roberts, stating [...] "His son, my grandfather, Caleb, documented that for a year he was depressed which isn't surprising after a huge commission like that that took him away from <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> loved most which was the landscape. But after that, he went back to it. He continued to paint but not with the desire to be rich and famous." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lone Wolf {{was one of}} {{the first}} Indian artists to paint other Indians, and Indian subjects. He was also one of the first Indian artists to be academically trained in art. [...] He was known for both his {{painting}} and sculpting skills. He played a [...] "significant role" [...] in capturing the events of the American West during the latter part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s. He had personal experience, as well as his tribe's personal knowledge of people and events. He was the first Indian to achieve national recognition as an artist, creating over 500 paintings. He was influenced and encouraged by Thomas Moran, who he met during his time wrangling at the Grand Canyon, and his style has been compared to that of Frederic Remington and Charles Marion Russell. Russell also encouraged and instructed Lone Wolf in his early career. Lone Wolf had his first solo show in Los Angeles in 1917. The headline in the Los Angeles Times about the exhibition read, [...] "Vance Thompson Discovers Wonderful Indian Artist, An Artist With a Vision." [...] In that article, Vance Thompson said of Lone Wolf, [...] "The message he has to give is his own; and already he has shaped – if he has not perfected – a distinct, individual and interesting technique." [...] He went to say, [...] "It is a rare thing to discover an artist. I have seen the young painters pass in droves through the schools and salons of Paris, and in 20 years I can claim to have been the discoverer of only one great artist.
