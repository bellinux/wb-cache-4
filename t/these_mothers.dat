5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} <b>these</b> <b>mothers</b> can distinguish which young are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E
5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle {{are tied to}} Avatars, but only two have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of <b>these</b> <b>mothers</b> became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar.|$|E

50|$|Women were branded as both {{a mother}} and a {{criminal}} if they happened to have a child out of wedlock. The choices the women at the time had were very limited.

25|$|Inverted or {{retracted}} nipples {{sometimes make}} {{attachment to the}} breast difficult. <b>These</b> <b>mothers</b> need additional support to feed their babies.

500|$|Later {{experiments}} were devised {{to test the}} mother-child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants. This early deprivation {{was found to have}} retarded the mothers' emotional development and her ability to engage in intercourse and in turn become pregnant. In response, Harlow and his colleagues created an apparatus to impregnate <b>these</b> <b>mothers</b> they named a [...] "rape rack". Harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth, they cared little for their offspring writing, [...] "these monkey mothers that had never experienced love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants". While some mothers simply ignored their children, Harlow characterized others as [...] "evil" [...] and abusive and in some instances reported them [...] "crushing the infant's face to the floor, chewing off the infant's feet and fingers, and in one case... putting the infant's head in her mouth and crushing it like an eggshell".|$|E
2500|$|Vanderbilt's {{research}} {{record is}} blemished, however, by a study university researchers, {{in conjunction with}} the Tennessee Department of Health, conducted on iron metabolism during pregnancy in the 1940s. [...] Between 1945 and 1949, over 800 pregnant women were given radioactive iron. Standards of informed consent for research subjects were not rigorously enforced at that time, and many of the women were not informed of the potential risks.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the real mother tongues of Singapore, namely the Chinese 'dialects' and Singlish, the linguistic varieties which, respectively, arrived {{with the original}} immigrants to the rapidly developing British colony, and evolved in the dynamic multilingual ecology over the decades. Curiously <b>these</b> <b>mother</b> tongues have been regarded with fear and treated with loathing in the official language policies and accompanying prestige planning {{that have been developed}} and executed in Singapore since independence, being actively denigrated and discouraged in official discourse, viewed as not having a place in the globalization goals of the nation. Looking beyond the official line and census figures, actual linguistic practices of the community of speakers testify to the vitality of these varieties, in spite of the official sanctions; moreover, in spite of itself, the government does in fact allow itself the use of <b>these</b> <b>mother</b> tongues when certain contexts call for it. This paper suggests that an enlightened consideration of native 'dialects' and nativized Singlish and the plurilingual practices in which they are used, {{as well as of the}} question of intelligibility, must point policy makers in directions where fears are assuaged and spaces made for the natural existence and evolution of such varieties in multilingual ecologies. © John Benjamins Publishing Company. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
2500|$|According to Edin: [...] "No one {{avoided the}} {{unnecessary}} expenditures, {{such as the}} occasional trip to the Dairy Queen, or a pair of stylish new sneakers for the son who might otherwise sell drugs to get them some money or something, or the Cable TV subscription for the kids home alone and you are afraid they will {{be out on the}} street if they are not watching TV." [...] However many mothers skipped meals or did odd jobs to cover those expenses. According to Edin, for [...] "most welfare-reliant mothers food and shelter alone cost almost as much as <b>these</b> <b>mothers</b> received from the government. For more than one-third, food and housing costs exceeded their cash benefits, leaving no extra money for uncovered medical care, clothing, and other household expenses." ...|$|E

It was quite safe socially to be in the Constitutional Storage; it gave standing; and Mrs. Forsyth fearlessly chanced acquaintance with <b>these</b> <b>mothers,</b> who would sometimes be there whole long mornings or afternoons, taking trunks out or putting them in. With the trunks set into the corridors and opened for them, they would spend the hours looking the contents over, talking to their neighbors, or rapt in long silences when they hesitated with things held off or up, and, after gazing absently at them, putting them back again. Sometimes they varied the process by laying things aside for sending home, and receipting for them at the office as [...] "goods selected." ...|$|E

6000|$|What {{are these}} Infant Welfare Centres, and have they really all this magic? They {{are places where}} mothers to be, or in being, can come for {{instruction}} and help in all that concerns birth and the care of their babies and children up to school age. [...] "Prevention is better than cure," [...] is the motto of these Centres. I {{went to one of}} the largest in London. It has about 600 entries in the year. There were perhaps 40 babies and children and perhaps 30 mothers there. About 20 of <b>these</b> <b>mothers</b> were learning sewing or knitting. Five of them were sitting round a nurse who was bathing a three-weeks-old baby. The young mother who can wash a baby to the taste and benefit of the baby by the light of nature must clearly be something of a phenomenon. In a room downstairs were certain little stoics whose health was poor; they were brought there daily to be watched. One was an air-raid baby, the thinnest little critter ever seen; an ashen bit of a thing through which the wind could blow; very silent, and asking [...] "Why?" [...] with its eyes. They showed me a mother who had just lost her first baby. The Centre was rescuing it from a pauper's funeral. I can see her now, coming in and sitting on the edge of a chair; the sudden puckering of her dried-up little face, the tears rolling down. I shall always remember the tone of her voice--"It's my baby." [...] Her husband is [...] "doing time"; and want of food and knowledge while she was [...] "carrying it" [...] caused the baby's death. Several mothers from her street come to the Centre; but, [...] "keeping herself to herself," [...] she never heard of it till too late. In a hundred little ways these Centres give help and instruction. They, and the Health Visitors who go along with them, are doing a great work; but there are many districts all over the country where there are no Centres to come to; no help and instruction to be got, however desperately wanted. Verily this land of ours still goes like Rachel mourning for her children. Disease, hunger, deformity, and death still hound our babes, and most of that hounding is avoidable. We must and shall revolt against the evil lot, which preventible ignorance, ill health, and poverty bring on hundreds of thousands of children.|$|E

The participants reported a stronger sense of belonging in the pair and felt more openness in terms of communication.
