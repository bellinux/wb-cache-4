5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220–265 CE) and Jin (265–420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and sluice gates.|$|E
5|$|Everest {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of the bespoke casual movement which, as the name suggests, provides individually tailored casual clothing of Savile Row quality, including: casual shirts; smart-casual jackets; T-shirts; and jeans. In collaboration with Levi's in 2004, he designed a tailored-denim suit, sold in Japanese retailer Oki-Ni's stores. Expanding the bespoke casual concept, he offered a bespoke denim tailoring service dressing celebrities from sports, Hollywood and rock music, such as David Beckham, Kevin Bacon and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs. Everest designed a suit collection in 2004/05 in collaboration with Rocawear, the fashion clothing company founded by American hip hop artists Damon Dash and Jay-Z. The advertising campaign was fronted by Dash's friends Kevin Bacon and Naomi Campbell. He teamed up with British casual and sportswear designer Kim Jones during 2005 and 2006. The collaboration produced tailoring collections for four seasons that were shown on the catwalk at Paris fashion week. For his next collaboration, in 2006 Everest showed a limited collection of menswear with New York hair salon Bumble and bumble, including a fully bespoke denim line, which retailed at around US$1,000. Marketed as a 'destination location', the retail space on the store's 8th floor, in the fashionable Meatpacking District of Manhattan, also featured a barbershop, a café and a teahouse. In autumn 2007, the Timothy Everest ready-to-wear collection was available in shops for the first time, including Flannels, Liberty and John Lewis. The range included suits, shirts and trousers. He was costume designer for the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, dressing its stars, including Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth. He opened a West End store in 2008, at Bruton Street, Mayfair, off Bond Street; less than five minutes walk from Savile Row. He has been a creative contributor and Sartorial Advisor to men's magazine <b>The</b> <b>Rake</b> since 2008.|$|E

This element was typically less decorative than the horizontal geison, and often of a differing profile from the horizontal geison of the same structure.

25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} <b>the</b> <b>rake,</b> with WR even announcing a time table for {{operating}} the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> would {{be transferred to}} CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> on the Harbour Line. After acquiring <b>the</b> <b>rake,</b> CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> to WR. <b>The</b> <b>rake</b> was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|E

In this scheme, the nature of the tines of <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> are not specified but could, for example, be surface integrins that often act as the feet of the cell to attach it to the substrate. The force required to rake the surface could be provided by the actin cytoskeleton.|$|E

25|$|Alex assembles {{a kind of}} rock-pick, {{but must}} modify the design if a wooden, two-pronged head is to be strong enough. (He cannot see much use for the tool in his largely rock-free sector, sensing that Bob has {{misunderstood}} his rake.) Alex draws a second blueprint for <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> head and sends it out as before. Curt crafts a hoe for slicing cleanly through roots to clear out a swamp. Don creates a gaff for fishing.|$|E
25|$|Blueprint users (language users) in the {{toolmakers}} paradigm can converge by inference on accurate replications of others' tools (mental content) after a laborious {{series of}} exchanges.

No guesswork or construction is needed: Alex puts <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> {{in a special}} chamber, pushes a button, and precise replicas appear instantly in similar chambers for Bob, Curt and Don.|$|E
25|$|Oysters are {{harvested}} by simply gathering {{them from their}} beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a pile, and then scoops them up with <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> or tongs.|$|E

25|$|During the English Restoration period (1660–88), {{the term}} 'rake' was used glamorously: the Restoration rake is a carefree, witty, sexually irresistible aristocrat typified by CharlesII's courtiers, the Earl of Rochester and the Earl of Dorset, who {{combined}} riotous living with intellectual pursuits and patronage of the arts. The Restoration rake is {{celebrated in the}} Restoration comedy of the 1660s and the 1670s. After the reign of CharlesII, and especially after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> was perceived negatively and became the butt of moralistic tales in which his typical fate was debtor's prison, permanent venereal disease, and, {{in the case of}} William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, syphilis-induced insanity and internment in Bedlam.|$|E

The train is also equipped with a new electrical system and software, automatic doors with emergency opening features, and GPS-based destination display on LED indicators. The old system of pulling a chain to halt the train was replaced by four intercoms per coach that enable commuters to communicate with the driver.|$|E

Determined that she will not marry without love, Letitia enlists the help of her father, Mr. Hardy, and Mrs. Racket, a widow, to turn Doricourt off the wedding by pretending that she, Letitia, is an unmannerly hoyden. Meanwhile, Doricourt's friend Sir George is being overprotective of his new wife, Lady Frances, who rebels and agrees to accompany Mrs. Racket for a day in the town and a masquerade ball that night. While out at an auction, Lady Frances meets <b>the</b> <b>rake,</b> Courtall, who brags to his friend Saville that he will seduce her. Meanwhile, Letitia's brazen acting succeeds in dissuading Doricourt from wanting to marry her. All characters converge at that night's masquerade. The disguised Letitia shows off her charms, bewitches Doricourt and then leaves before he can find out who she is. Courtall, disguised the same way as Sir George, lures the lady he thinks is Lady Frances back to his house. However, Saville has replaced the real Lady Frances with a prostitute who is disguised as Lady Frances is. Shamed, Courtall leaves town. The next day, Doricourt, who has been told that Mr. Hardy is on his deathbed, visits him and reluctantly agrees to marry Letitia after all. Then the disguised Letitia enters and reveals her true identity to the overjoyed Doricourt, who also learns that Hardy was not ill after all.|$|E

He added that there are [...] "many, many reasons for its perfection, but what stands out most for me was how savage and single-minded Bob is in the episode. He wants to kill Bart and he makes no secret of it, save for lying to the parole board. Episodes since have made Bob far too wishy-washy. This was Bob in his prime—his vengeful, glorious, hilarious prime." [...] Canning also placed it at #1 {{on the list of}} the Top 10 Sideshow Bob episodes. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted that the episode [...] "turns {{limitations}} into strengths by spinning the need to fill out time into some of the series' sharpest, funniest and weirdest gags. <b>The</b> <b>Rake</b> Effect might be its greatest gift to comedy but its virtues go far beyond that. Sideshow Bob episodes consistently rank among the show's best and this represents the gold standard all subsequent Sideshow Bob episodes aspire to." [...] Empire called Bob's mishaps while strapped under the Simpsons' car the eighth-best film parody in the show, and called <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> scene [...] "the best bit of slapstick in Simpson history." [...] The parody of Cape Fear was named the 33rd greatest film reference {{in the history of the}} show by Total Films Nathan Ditum.
