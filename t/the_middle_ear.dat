5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> by the eardrum. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and {{is connected to the}} throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner ear, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{and the outer}} ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|Sound waves {{travel through}} the outer ear, are {{modulated}} by <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear. This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain, where it is registered as sound.|$|E
25|$|This {{accelerated}} {{the development of}} <b>the</b> mammalian <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R

40|$|Because of the {{increasing}} frequencies of recovery of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae from <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of children with acute otitis media, non-beta-lactam antibiotics are being explored as treatment alternatives to amoxicillin. In this study, the efficacy of a 10 -day course of clarithromycin was evaluated with chinchillas. After the pharmacokinetic profiles for clarithromycin were established, 180 animals were {{assigned to one of}} three susceptibility groups (n = 60 /group; penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant S. pneumoniae), and <b>the</b> right <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> was infected with the appropriate strain of S. pneumoniae. Equal numbers of animals in each group were treated orally beginning on day 2 with a 10 -day course of clarithromycin (15 mg/kg of body weight; given twice a day) or amoxicillin as a control (20 mg/kg twice a day). On days 4, 9, and 13, otomicroscopy and tympanometry were performed, and on day 13, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> were cultured for bacteria. The results showed 100 % eradication of the challenge organism in both treatment groups for the susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae. Cultures were negative in 87 and 74 % (P > 0. 05) of the animals challenged with the intermediate resistant strains and in 100 and 56 % (P < 0. 05) of the animals challenged with the resistant strains and treated with clarithromycin and amoxicillin, respectively. There were no differences between treatments in the diagnosis of effusion for any group. These results support the use of the chinchilla to evaluate drug efficacy in the treatment of acute otitis media and show clarithromycin to be effective in sterilizing <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of animals challenged with penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{lies between}} the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} ear has specific {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{works as an}} impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E
40|$|A 7 -week-old male Saker falcon {{died with}} a history of severe {{refractory}} dyspnoea and respiratory signs. Microscopical lesions included moderate to severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> conjunctivae, third eyelids, choanae, salivary glands of the tongue, turbinates, larynx, trachea, syrinx and bronchi. The lesions were associated with variable numbers of Cryptosporidium spp., further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and in-situ hybridization. Cryptosporidium baileyi was identified by DNA sequence analysis. C. baileyi may therefore be a cause of otitis media in raptors as it is in man. It is most likely that <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of <b>the</b> Saker falcon acquired the infection through the eustachian tubes that originate near the pharynx in the oral cavity. This is the first description of otitis media associated with C. baileyi in a bird or a mammal except man...|$|R
25|$|Ears and sinuses: There {{is a risk}} of {{stretched}} or burst eardrums, usually crushed inwards during descent {{but sometimes}} stretched outwards on ascent. The diver can {{use a variety of}} methods to let air into or out of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> via <b>the</b> Eustachian tubes. Sometimes swallowing will open the Eustachian tubes and equalise the ears.|$|R
5000|$|Conductive {{hearing loss}} (problems with <b>the</b> outer or <b>middle</b> <b>ear)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{works as an}} impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
50|$|Only in {{the early}} Triassic, about hundred million years after they conquered land, did <b>the</b> tympanic <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> evolve (independently) in all the {{tetrapod}} lineages.|$|R
5000|$|Land {{vertebrates}} evolved <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> independently in each major lineage, and {{are this}} {{the result of}} parallel evolution. The configurations of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy. Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw. Furthermore, {{it is apparent that}} the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.|$|R
50|$|Barotrauma is {{the injury}} to the tissues of air filled spaces in the body {{as a result of}} {{differences}} in pressure between the body spaces and the ambient atmospheric pressure. Air filled spaces include <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> paranasal sinuses, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. One would be predisposed by a pre-existing upper respiratory infection, nasal allergies, recurrent changing pressures, dehydration, or a poor equalizing technique.|$|R
5|$|The {{three small}} bones in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit {{sound from the}} eardrum to the inner ear. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{works as an}} impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5000|$|Type 4 {{describes}} a repair when the stapes foot plate is movable, but the crura are missing. <b>The</b> resulting <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> will only consist of the Eustachian tube and hypotympanum.|$|R
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear's</b> eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|R
30|$|To conclude, <b>the</b> {{most common}} <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{injuries}} affecting CHL are incudo-malleolar and incudo-stapedial joint luxation.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes {{into contact with the}} quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to changes}} in facial structures, infants, toddlers, and {{children}} with distal 18q- often have poor drainage from <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> leading to a build-up of fluid. This can in turn lead to recurrent ear and sinus infections. Antibiotics are typically required to treat these infections. In addition, the diagnosis of ear infections in children with 18q- is frequently complicated by stenosis or atresia of the ear canals, a common finding in people with distal 18q-.|$|R
50|$|For a {{long time}} it was unknown if haramiyids were crown-group mammals, or if they should {{be placed in the}} stem-group Mammaliaformes. This {{uncertainty}} {{stems from the fact that}} haramiyid remains were mostly restricted to teeth and jaw fragments. However, new discoveries of much more complete haramiyid fossils have settled the issue - haramiyids are undoubtedly crown-group mammals. For example, the specimens show evidence of a typical mammalian <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>the</b> area just inside the eardrum that turns vibrations in the air into ripples in <b>the</b> <b>ear's</b> fluids. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of mammals are unique in that they have three bones, as evidenced in the new fossils.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{pathogenesis}} of <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> inflammation {{caused by}} Streptococcus pneumoniae was explored in the chinchilla model with different pneumococcal cell wall (CW) preparations, including isolated native CW, M 1 muramidase CW (M 1 -CW) digest, amidase CW digest, and M 1 peptidoglycan (M 1 -PG) digest. Inflammatory cell and lysozyme concentrations in <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> fluid (MEF) were measured between 6 and 72 h after <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> were inoculated {{with one of}} the preparations or sterile saline. <b>Middle</b> <b>ear</b> histopathology was measured quantitatively at 72 h. Native CW, M 1 -CW digest, and amidase-CW digest caused significantly more inflammatory cell influx and lysozyme accumulation in MEF than saline did. M 1 -PG digest also caused more inflammatory cell influx and lysozyme accumulation in MEF than saline did but caused less inflammation than native CW or either CW digest. Epithelial metaplasia was significantly greater in ears inoculated with native CW than in ears inoculated with the CW or PG digest or with saline. Pneumococcal CW is, therefore, the principal factor that initiates <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> inflammation in acute pneumococcal otitis media, and CW teichoication seems to be important in initiating this response...|$|R
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{generate}} anatomical data on <b>the</b> human <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{and adjacent}} structures {{to serve as}} a base for the development and optimization of new implantable hearing aid transducers. Implantable <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> hearing aid transducers, i. e. the equivalent to the loudspeaker in conventional hearing aids, should ideally fit into the majority of adult <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> and should utilize the limited space optimally to achieve sufficiently high maximal output levels. For several designs, more anatomical data are needed. METHODS: Twenty temporal bones of 10 formalin-fixed adult human heads were scanned by a computed tomography system (CT) using a slide thickness of 0. 63 mm. Twelve landmarks were defined and 24 different distances were calculated for each temporal bone. RESULTS: A statistical description of 24 distances in <b>the</b> adult human <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> which may limit or influence <b>the</b> design of <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> transducers is presented. Significant inter-individual differences but no significant differences for gender, side, age or degree of pneumatization of the mastoid were found. Distances, which were not analyzed {{for the first time in}} this study, were found to be in good agreement with the results of earlier studies. CONCLUSION: A data set describing <b>the</b> adult human <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> anatomy quantitatively from the point of view of designers of new implantable hearing aid transducers has been generated. In principle, the method employed in this study using standard CT scans could also be used preoperatively to rule out exclusion criteria...|$|R
