5|$|While slight {{variations}} on the standard genetic code had been predicted earlier, none was discovered until 1979, when researchers studying human mitochondrial genes determined <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> an alternative code. However, the mitochondria of many other eukaryotes, including most plants, use the standard code. Many slight variants have been discovered since, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Further, the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} of forced conversion and destruction of many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE {{with the exception of}} the basement, and used the core of the building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> iron bars to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple administrators were able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E

5|$|Most aquatic stereospondyls have {{flattened}} heads. When feeding, {{they probably}} opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws. The jaw {{mechanics of the}} plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known, {{and is one of}} the most highly adapted. Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50Â° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto-occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck. As the skull is raised, the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward. Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls, but they are not as well adapted for such movement. D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls. He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959, suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way. At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles, but it is now thought <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle. Plagiosuchus, a close relative of Gerrothorax, also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to. Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull, suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth.|$|E

5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} of Sabre Wulf, Ultimate Play the Game, {{had a reputation}} for secrecy. The company rarely gave interviews or revealed details about their internal practices or upcoming games. Little is known about their development process apart from <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> Sage IV computers, preferred to develop for the ZX Spectrum's Z80 microprocessor, and often outsourced development for other platforms, such as those that ran 6502 microprocessors. After releasing Atic Atac at the end of 1983, Ultimate went silent until it ran teaser advertisements for Sabre Wulf in April 1984. The company rarely depicted actual gameplay in their advertisements. They had already prepared Knight Lore, the third game in the Sabreman series, in advance of the character's introduction in Sabre Wulf. Ultimate withheld Knight Lore for about a year because they felt Sabre Wulf would not have sold as well once players saw the former's graphical advancements. Knight Lore subsequently became known as a seminal work in British gaming history and an iconic game of the 1980s for its popularization of the isometric platformer format.|$|E
5|$|To {{convert the}} {{backlink}} data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (é¦æ¸¯) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly ShÅnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in ShÅnen Magazine. She stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Åto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E
