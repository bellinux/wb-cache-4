5|$|The major {{applications}} of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it {{is put into}} such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of <b>total</b> <b>use).</b> For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A {{small part of the}} copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with <b>total</b> <b>use</b> progressively increasing.|$|E

Methods: Questionnaires administered to eligible participants that rated the participants’ knowledge of general sun safety, sunscreen application, and FDA labeling on sunscreen products compared to demographic data. Demographic data were collected on age, gender, years resided in Arizona, whether participants has or known anyone {{with a history of}} skin cancer and ethnicity. Main Results: Questionnaires were completed by 62 participants. When comparing skin cancer versus no skin cancer using student’s t-test, {{there was no significant difference}} (P= 0. 09). When comparing gender versus <b>total</b> <b>using</b> student’s t-test, there was no significant difference (P= 0. 62).

25|$|Water use {{is about}} 83.5 km3, or 20% of water {{availability}} {{in an average}} year. However, there are large variations in the utilization rate between years and regions. For example, in the coastal part of the Kantō region that includes Tokyo the utilization rate is over 90% in a dry year. In the relatively dry north of Kyushu {{it is more than}} 50%. Of the <b>total</b> <b>use</b> 55.2 km3 was for agriculture, 16.2 km3 for domestic use and 12.1 km3 for industrial use. Despite the introduction of water-saving devices domestic per capita use declined only slightly from 322 liter per capita per day in 2000 to 314 in 2004. Per capita water use thus is slightly lower than in the United States (371 liter in 2005) and more than twice as high as in Germany (122 liter in 2007) or in England (145 liter in 2009).|$|E
500|$|McLaren {{deliberately}} introduced two brand-new engines {{for both}} Alonso and Button at the , effectively moving {{them to the}} back of the grid, but allowing them to contest the Italian and Singapore Grands Prix—deemed to be crucial races in assessing the engine's development—without the risk of a penalty. Despite this plan, the team were forced to take another penalty in Italy when further engine changes were needed, bringing their <b>total</b> <b>use</b> up to nine engines from the original allocation of four. Belgium also saw the team's second major aerodynamic update: the team added extra fins to the front of the floor to improve air flow under the car, lowered the height of the sidepods and revised the engine cover. The position of the radiator used to cool the energy recovery system was also changed. Both cars completed the Belgian Grand Prix, but once again finished outside the points, one lap down in thirteenth and fourteenth place. Button described the result as [...] "embarrassing" [...] after both cars were classified as finishing behind Sebastian Vettel despite Vettel retiring from the race on the final lap. The team reverted to the longer-specification snub nose for the Italian Grand Prix in order to provide better aerodynamic balance and lower drag on the high-speed Autodromo Nazionale Monza circuit. The change proved to be of little benefit, as both drivers were eliminated in the first qualifying period and struggled throughout the race. Button finished in fourteenth, while Alonso retired with an electrical problem but was classified in eighteenth position as he had completed 90% of race winner Lewis Hamilton's race distance. The race marked a milestone of fifty races since McLaren's last Grand Prix win at the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
