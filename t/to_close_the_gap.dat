5|$|The result meant Montoya {{moved up}} into fifth {{place in the}} Drivers' Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who {{clinched}} the title two races beforehand. Barrichello's third position finish allowed him <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to David Coulthard. Williams' strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points with two races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1961, {{the second}} prototype, XP836, {{performed}} its first take off conventionally. Continuing {{tests of the}} two prototypes proceeded <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between vertical take off and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E

5|$|Red Bull Racing {{suffered}} a double retirement, with Vettel falling victim to another alternator failure and Mark Webber spinning violently at the Ascari chicane, with the resultant {{damage to his}} tyres sending vibrations through the car that forced him to retire. This allowed Hamilton to leapfrog both drivers and Kimi Räikkönen – who finished the race fifth – to take {{second place in the}} World Drivers' Championship, with the result enabling McLaren <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Red Bull in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|With five draws and one defeat, West Germany {{failed to}} qualify for the inaugural 1984 European Championship, {{finishing}} third in the qualifying group. In the beginning, Bisanz's primary objective was <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to the Scandinavian countries and Italy– then the strongest teams in Europe. He emphasized training in basic skills and the need for an effective youth programme. Starting in 1985, Bisanz increasingly called-up younger players, but at first had little success with this concept, as West Germany again failed {{to qualify for}} the 1987 European Championship finals.|$|E
5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it {{impossible}} for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, the ROK Army transferred that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7, and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coulthard {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who began from pole position. Barrichello began from {{third on the}} grid and overtook Coulthard going into the first corner. Michael Schumacher maintained his start line advantage and kept the lead {{after the first round}} of pit stops. During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position.

5|$|Häkkinen {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher {{on the front}} row of the grid. Michael Schumacher attempted to defend his lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen's path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher heading into the first corner, with Coulthard withstanding Williams driver Ralf Schumacher attempts to pass him to maintain third position. Michael Schumacher managed <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap between himself and Häkkinen {{towards the end of the}} race to secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 1996, Liverpool faced Newcastle United in a Premier League fixture at Anfield, {{during the}} 1995–96 season. Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle's three.

On the game's first possession, the Tech defense forced a Clemson punt. Clemson mishandled the kick, and Tech was able to recover the ball at the Clemson 23-yard line.

5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted {{to break through}} at several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating raking broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between herself and her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte.

5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using {{them as part of}} a larger force.

Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} pit {{stop on the}} 26th lap and emerged behind Michael Schumacher, while Verstappen retired from the race with a {{mechanical}} problem. All of the leaders had taken their stops {{by the start of}} lap 28, the top ten were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Salo, Zonta and Wurz. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the pit lane, triggering the second round of pit stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their pit stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's pit stop was problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the pit lane on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E

Rosberg crossed the line to take his seventh consecutive victory, a feat to that point only achieved by Alberto Ascari, Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen rounded up the podium ahead of the two Williams drivers, Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa. Rosberg recorded the first Grand Slam of his career, meaning he won the race, recorded the fastest lap, achieved pole position and led every lap.

Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, {{as he continued to}} stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second stop-go penalty.
