That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.|$|E

During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame.|$|E

Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable. A Cameron Parish official noted [...] "There's power {{out all over the}} place, and we understand <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a bit of damage at Holly Beach". In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures. In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was [...] "spotty" [...] and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded, and bayous overflowed. A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area. Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1million (1982USD).|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

Even so, the Japanese in the Nihonmachi of Hội An exerted a powerful influence upon the affairs of the trading port, the Japanese demand for silk being so great that the comings and goings of Japanese merchant ships every year caused dramatic cyclical shifts in market prices. On average, more than ten Japanese ships visited the port every year during the period of the [...] "red seal ships", that is, between roughly 1590 and 1635; this represented fully a quarter of all Japanese maritime economic activity, more than that of any other individual port.|$|E

The ravine was grooved a long time ago by rains and thawing snow. The ravine went down to the Lublin road, near the Świnka River Valley. It was the place where Jews in the rows of four each were walked from the ghetto. Afterwards, a machine gun did its job. Jews were killed not only in groups but also individually. It was done during the later phase of the murders, while searching for those who hid in the recesses in the ghetto. Moreover, the wounded who tried to hide were also hit by death blows. For the sake of certainty, the Germans threw hand grenades into the pit where dead bodies lay. Then, Jewish policemen were ordered to cover the bodies with a layer of ground." [...] During the Holocaust, about 2,500 Jews who lived in Leczna prior to the war, {{were killed by}} the Nazis. Most of them were sent to Sobibor on three deportations - the first one on April or May 1942 (200 people), on October 23, 1942 (3,000 people) and on April 29, 1943 (300 people).|$|E

2500|$|The {{average size}} of the four classes {{in the first year}} of the college was thirty boys. But Form IV {{commenced}} with fourteen pupils. These had come from ten different schools. There had been no unity in the textbooks used in these schools but also the boys had studied different subjects. By the end of the first term it was evident to the Brothers that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a teaching problem and it was decided to start the second term of Form IV with Theorem One in Geometry and Lesson One in French, Latin, Algebra, etc. - all the start of Form III work. The object was to get through two complete years' work (Form III and Form IV - Years 9 and 10) in two terms (i.e. the second and third terms - from May to December). Many of the fourteen pupils transferred down to Form III. For the senior class, play or recreation time was cut in half. School was conducted on Saturday mornings, when the week's theoretical study of Chemistry was tested by practical experiments. [...] "No text books were allowed on Saturdays, and woe betide any student who didn't know the properties and tests for various gases and metals and their respective weights". Brother O'Driscoll, a large man, vigorously thumped or pounded the blackboard to drive home important points. Several new blackboards had to be acquired. By the third term only four students were left - Bill Aitkin, Max Denize, Des and John Rosser. The following year (1940) Brother O'Driscoll allowed three to sit for Matriculation (University Entrance) and one for the Public Service Examination. All four passed. The first Dux of the college was Des Rosser in 1940. His twin brother John was dux in 1941. The brothers subsequently donated the Rosser Cup, presented each year for Dux of St Peter's College.|$|E

[...] The original plan was {{for this to be}} a self-released single with one track as the A-side and the other two as B-sides. A friend of the band who wanted to help manage them told them he would take the tapes to the east coast and shop them around to the independent labels there. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a bit of interest expressed by a number of labels, but The Stems chose Citadel Records because of the high quality of their releases at the time.

[...] The Stems first Sydney show was a sold out show with the Painters and Dockers at the Trade Union Club. The tour was perfectly timed with the Sydney inner city scene rediscovering 1960s music and fashion. The group met with an enthusiastic response, which culminated in a full house at the legendary Trade Union Club for their final show. The single {{reached the top of the}} independent charts, and also sold 500 copies in England. The single was the second highest selling independent single for Australia in 1985, behind Hoodoo Gurus' [...] "Like Wow - Wipeout!." [...] During this period, they recorded the single [...] "Tears Me in Two" [...] and the Love Will Grow - Rosebud Volume 1 EP, both produced by Rob Younger of the Radio Birdman.

The chief exponent of the aggressive actions of Aloneftis, Omonia tried to get his head to score in the first half, which, however, the more conventional opportunities belonged to Anorthosis.
