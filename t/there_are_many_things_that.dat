6000|$|Answer. Well, soul, though Satan may baffle thee, he cannot so serve thine Advocate; if thou {{must not}} speak for thyself, Christ thine Advocate can speak for thee. Lemuel was to open his mouth for the dumb-to wit, for the sons of destruction, and to plead {{the cause of the}} poor and needy (Prov 31:8, 9). If we knew the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, so as the Word reveals it, we would believe, we would hope, and would, {{notwithstanding}} all discouragements, wait for the salvation of the Lord.

"I acquit you of both {{much easier}} than I can acquit myself of the charge of {{weakness}} and folly," [...] continued Cecilia; [...] "but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have occurred, since we last met, to prevent a repetition of such inconsiderate rashness on my part. One of them is," [...] she added, smiling sweetly, [...] "that I have numbered twelve additional months to my age, and a hundred to my experience. Another, and perhaps a more important one, is, that my uncle then continued among the friends of his youth, surrounded by those whose blood mingles with his own; but here he lives a stranger; and, though he finds some consolation in dwelling in a building where his ancestors have dwelt before him, yet he walks as an alien through its gloomy passages, and would find the empty honor but a miserable compensation for the kindness and affection of one whom he has loved and cherished from her infancy." ...|$|E

If the question were whether to die or to live forever, then, indeed, scarcely anything should justify the putting a fellow-creature to death. But since it only shortens his earthly life, and brings a little forward a change which, since God permits it, is, we may conclude, as fit to take place then as at any other time, it alters the case. I often think that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> occur to us in our daily life, many unknown crises, that are more important to us than this mysterious circumstance of death, which we deem {{the most important of}} all.

60|$|By {{this word}} PURE I {{understand}} sometimes the chiefest good, the highest good. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> {{may be called}} good, {{but none of them}} are good as grace is good. All things indeed are pure, that is, all creatures in themselves are good and serviceable to man, but they are not so good as grace (Rom 14:20; Gen 1:31). 'There is a generation that are pure,' that are good in their own eyes (Prov 30:12). There are good men, good consciences, good works, good days, good angels, &c., but none so good as grace, for it is grace that has made them so. Grace, this water of life, therefore is good, superlatively good, good in the highest degree, for that it makes all things good, and preserveth them good. And whatever it be that this water of life washeth not, it is soil, and given to the curse, as the prophet intimates where he saith, 'But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt' (Eze 47:1).|$|E
