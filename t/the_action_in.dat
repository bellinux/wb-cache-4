5|$|By {{the end of}} the action, the American {{boats were}} all damaged and their crews {{suffered}} four killed, including Allen, who died some four hours after the battle ended, and three wounded. The pirates suffered heavier casualties, with 14 bodies being counted by the Americans at the end of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> addition to several buccaneers presumed drowned. Alligator returned to Matanzas with the recovered prizes; there Allen was buried with an escort provided by the local governor.|$|E

5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. <b>The</b> <b>action,</b> <b>in</b> space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.|$|E
5|$|Daphnis et Chloé was {{commissioned}} in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine {{had a reputation}} for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.|$|E

5|$|In France {{the battle}} was {{represented}} as a victory, largely based on a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley {{on the strength of}} a letter written by Captain Troude, which claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames, but also Caesar and Spencer (misidentified in the report as Superb). Troude claimed that he had not only driven all of these ships off and completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore by 07:00, but that he had then waited nearby until 10:00 in the hope of resuming <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> reward for his services as represented, Troude was promoted and highly praised, later holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} {{the battle of the}} Glorious First of June the {{previous}} year, rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail, the only officer commended being Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had only joined <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's. Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{late summer}} of 1777, British General John Burgoyne led a major {{invasion}} army south from Quebec, {{with the intention}} of splitting off rebellious New England. But General Howe in New York took his army south to Philadelphia instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany—a major strategic mistake. Meanwhile, Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General Philip Schuyler and his successor Horatio Gates. The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the French Revolutionary Wars, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg {{remained}} as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps, approximately 10,000 men, under the overall command of Anton, Prince Esterházy. He was stationed in the Breisgau, a Habsburg territory between the Black Forest and the Rhine River. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the Swiss Cantons, or north-central Germany. His brigade defended Kehl, a small village immediately across the Rhine from Strassbourg, but most of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> 1792 occurred further north, in present-day Belgium, near the cities of Speyer and Trier, and at Frankfurt on the Main River.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} {{the start of the war}} in September 1939, Z1 Leberecht Maass and another {{destroyer}} unsuccessfully attacked Polish ships in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. She was lightly damaged during <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to attack British fishing trawlers (Operation Wikinger), the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering. A court of inquiry convened during the war determined that she and a sister ship were hit by bombs, but a post-war investigation determined that she had drifted into a newly laid British minefield. Z1 Leberecht Maass broke in half with the loss of the most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|The Russian and French armies met in February 1807 at {{the savage}} and indecisive Battle of Eylau, which left behind between 30,000–50,000 casualties. Napoleon regrouped his forces {{after the battle}} and {{continued}} to pursue the Russians in upcoming months. <b>The</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> Poland finally culminated on 14 June 1807, when the French mauled their Russian opponents at the Battle of Friedland. The resulting Treaty of Tilsit in July ended two years of bloodshed and left France as the dominant power on the European continent. It also severely weakened Prussia and formed a Franco-Russian axis designed to resolve disputes among European nations.|$|E

Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five African Americans {{earned the}} Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, {{including}} seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen {{soldiers of the}} United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen African American men earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake {{was the first to}} actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.|$|E
