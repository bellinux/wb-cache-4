5|$|The Carmel Mountain {{has three}} main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si’ach. For {{the most part}} these valleys are undeveloped natural {{corridors}} that run up through the city from the coast to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Godesberg, 18 November – 17 December 1583, was {{the first}} major siege of the Cologne War (1583–1589). Seeking to wrest control of an {{important}} fortification, Bavarian and mercenary soldiers surrounded the Godesberg, and the village then of the same name, now Bad Godesberg, located at its foot. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> sat a formidable fortress, similarly named Godesburg, built in the early 13th century during a contest over the election of two competing archbishops.|$|E

5|$|Bågenholm's colleagues made {{an attempt}} to free her but failed. At 18:27 local time (CET), seven minutes after she {{had fallen into the}} water, they called for help on a mobile phone. Police {{lieutenant}} Bård Mikalsen received the call and put together two rescue teams; one at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> and one at the bottom. Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but they told him that the helicopter had left to transport a sick child. Mikalsen was persistent and convinced the dispatcher to turn the helicopter around.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them at the very <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E

5|$|Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> and {{informs the}} pair that the vampires have already summoned a {{powerful}} demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon {{the army of}} Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Edwin H. Armstrong {{installed}} an FM-broadcasting {{station on}} the top of Mount Washington in 1937. The station included the original broadcast tower, the Yankee Building, which housed the crew and transmitter equipment, and the first power house building. The station stopped operating in 1948, due to excessive maintenance costs. The original Armstrong tower still stands today. The Yankee Building also remains and continues to serve as a communications facility, housing equipment for numerous tenants including cellular telephone providers and public safety agencies. The only building no longer standing from Armstrong's original station is the original power house which was destroyed by fire in 2003 when a fire spread to it that had started in a neighboring building. In 1954 a TV tower and transmitters were installed for WMTW, Channel8, licensed to Poland Spring, Maine. The station continuously broadcast until 2002 from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> including local forecasts by (now retired) WMTW transmitter engineer Marty Engstrom.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> He skied {{as fast as he could}} to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

5|$|They {{climb up}} and {{eventually}} reach a small abandoned house. While there, {{the man is}} attacked by a big cat, which the woman strikes away {{with a piece of}} wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the time they reached the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white Latin cross brassard, identifying him as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as they carried no weapons.|$|E
5|$|East of Middletown, US40Alternate {{passes through}} a {{suburban}} area then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a climbing lane eastbound to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US40Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane eastbound, two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At {{the base of the}} mountain, the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps to and from the direction of Frederick. East of I-70, US40Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from eastbound US40Alternate to westbound US40 or from eastbound US40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944, Freyberg {{was made}} {{commander}} of the New Zealand Corps, newly formed for the Battle of Monte Cassino, while Kippenberger was promoted to temporary major-general and made {{commander of the}} 2nd Division. This was the pinnacle of his military career. The division had moved into the line around Cassino, replacing the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, which had been attacking the strongly defended German positions. The first attack by the New Zealanders on 17 February was unsuccessful despite {{the bombing of the}} Monte Cassino abbey, which Kippenberger supported. A second attack was planned for 20 February, but it was delayed by bad weather. On 2 March, Kippenberger climbed the slopes of nearby Mount Trocchio to gain an overview of the Cassino battlefield. Near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> he triggered a land mine which exploded and injured both legs to the extent that one foot was severed in the blast. He was evacuated to a medical centre, and the other foot and the lower portions of both legs were amputated. When the news of his injuries spread to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it was met with some disbelief and shock, greatly affecting morale.|$|E
5|$|US40Scenic {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 over Town Hill and Sideling Hill, two of the many northsouth ridges of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians between Cumberland and Hancock {{that needed to be}} crossed first by the Baltimore and Cumberland Turnpike, then US40, and most recently I-68. The portion of US40Scenic from its western terminus over Town Hill to Sideling Hill Creek follows the original {{alignment of}} the turnpike and US40 except for deviations at both ends due to construction of the new alignments of US40 and I-68. The Baltimore and Cumberland Turnpike and later US40 rose abruptly from Sideling Hill Creek to climb the west flank of Sideling Hill, following what is today McFarland Road east, turning south at Hixon Road, and continuing south along the same line, now abandoned, to join the present line at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> On the east flank, the old road began along the current alignment, then turned east a short distance south of the present curve to the east for a steeper descent that followed Western Pike before joining the present alignment a short distance west of MD144.|$|E
