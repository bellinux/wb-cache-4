The 270ppm code does break backwards compatibility with the 4-code system, but is only in use around New York Penn Station as part of a high density signaling upgrade. The 270ppm code and 60 mph speed were chosen to be compatible with the cab signals installed on the Long Island Rail Road trains that also use Penn Station.|$|R
5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a <b>turnout.</b> The <b>train</b> derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|R
5000|$|As a horse-operated railway, {{there was}} no {{signalling}} system, and the level crossings did not have gates. There were several passing places—known as turnouts—on the single line, and the uphill direction was given a straight path, the downhill taking the deviation onto the turnout. There were regulations as to which [...] "train" [...] should have priority when opposing movements met; if two trains met at a turnout, the downhill one destined for Bristol took the turnout; if they met between <b>turnouts,</b> the uphill <b>train</b> set back to the previous <b>turnout.</b> Horse drawn <b>trains</b> generally had {{to give way to}} steam-hauled trains, and to go into a turnout to be overtaken by them.|$|R

50|$|On 18 January 1909, a {{test run}} on the line was {{undertaken}} in order to check it technically. The train being used for the test arrived at Elmstein station at 11 am. The official inauguration took place five days later. The first train was due to depart Elmstein at 6.20 am. However, as {{it was about to}} leave there was a fatal accident. The Jungfern service was just a few metres {{from the end of the}} line when, owing to a wrongly set <b>turnout,</b> the <b>train</b> accelerated at full steam into the locomotive shed and killed a spectator. The locomotive escaped with only a few scratches; the shed, however, suffered more serious damage that had to be repaired. As a replacement, a train from Lambrecht arrived at the end of the section at 8.15 am; around 10 am the first train finally left Elmstein for Lambrecht.|$|R
5000|$|... 70 {{years after}} pulse code cab signals had been introduced, the 4 speed design {{was found to}} be {{insufficient}} for speeds not envisioned when the system was designed. The two most pressing problems were the use of high speed <b>turnouts,</b> which allowed <b>trains</b> to take a diverging route faster than the normal 30 or 45 mph covered by the existing cab signals. The introduction of Amtrak's Acela Express service with its 135 mph to 150 mph maximum speeds would also exceed the capabilities of the legacy signaling system and its 125 mph design speed.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper explores {{the importance of}} turnout location on the provision of bus replacement services that are required during periods of service disruption on a railway network. <b>Turnouts</b> allow <b>trains</b> to be guided from one railway track to another, enabling trains to turn around {{at a point where}} services are cancelled. They adjoin railway stations that will inevitably serve as an intermediate termination or commencement location on a railway line and where bus replacement services are provided to and from. A theoretical modelling exercise was undertaken to determine the impacts of altering turnout location based on fixed unplanned service disruption assumptions on the Sandringham railway line, in Melbourne’s suburban rail network. Attributes such as annual number of disruptions, level of commuter demand and volume of disruptions were assumed. Performance indicators including turnout cost, bus bridging costs and commuter disruption costs were assessed for each option. Results indicate that turnout location plays a significant role on the design of bus replacement services and can be a cost effective means of reducing costs to both user...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Turnouts play a {{key role}} in the railway {{transportation}} process. One-sided and many-sided curved turnouts were railed over the last 20 years in difficult conditions (curved sections, yard necks). They have a number of geometric features, unlike the conventional one-sided turnouts. Today the normative documents prohibit laying such turnouts in curved track sections and only partially regulate the assessment procedure of their real condition. The question of establishment the permissible train speed within the curved turnouts is still open. In this regard, authors propose to set the train speed according to the driving comfort criterion using the results of field measurements of ordinates from the baseline for the particular curved turnout. Methodology. The article considers the criteria using which one can set the permissible speed on the turnouts. It defines the complexity of their application, advantages and disadvantages. Findings. The work analyzes the speed distribution along the length of the real curved turnout for the forward and lateral directions. It establishes the change rate values of unbalanced accelerations for the existing norms of the curved track sections maintenance according to the difference in the adjacent bend versine at speeds up to 160 km/h. Originality. A method for establishing the trains’ speed limit within the curved turnouts was developed. It takes into account the actual geometric position in the plan of forward and lateral turnout directions. This approach makes it possible to establish a barrier places in plan on the <b>turnouts</b> limiting the <b>train</b> speed. Practical value. The proposed method makes it possible to objectively assess and set the trains’ permissible speed on the basis of the ordinate measurement of the forward and lateral directions of the curved turnouts from the baseline using the driving comfort criteria. The method was tested using real turnouts, which are located within the Pridneprovsk Railway...|$|R
