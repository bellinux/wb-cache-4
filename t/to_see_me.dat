5|$|Healey I {{advised to}} go to his brother at Bolton, and get some money, and keep out of sight entirely, until {{something}} further was known. His best way would be to avoid Manchester, and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> I would keep him company as far as Agecroft.|$|E
5|$|My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will {{you come}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> {{as soon as}} you can. I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> at the palace.|$|E

Awful dirty on the cattle-boat, though." ...|$|R

Entitled 'John Cleese: Last Time <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>Me</b> Before I Die tour', he visited Halifax, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Victoria and finished in Vancouver, performing to mostly sold-out venues. Cleese returned to the stage in Dubai in November 2013, where he performed to a sold-out theater.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me.</b> We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
500|$|The abbess of {{the convent}} {{included}} her own note inviting Byron {{to come to}} see Allegra {{before he left for}} Pisa and assuring him [...] "how much she is loved." [...] On the back of this letter, Byron wrote: [...] "Sincere enough, but not very flattering – for she wants <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> because 'it is the fair' to get some paternal Gingerbread – I suppose." [...] Byron never responded to Allegra's letter or visited the child during the thirteen months she was in the convent.|$|E
5000|$|Phil Griffin {{shot the}} music video for the song. The video {{features}} Bedingfield {{in several different}} rooms and outfits, with multiple versions of her suddenly appearing and then disappearing. The music video uses the Radio Edit of the song which alters the bridge: the lyrics [...] "I wish somebody would disrespect my man, they gon' have <b>to</b> come <b>see</b> <b>me.</b> I go hard for my baby..." [...] being changed to [...] "if someone ever should disrespect my love, they gon' have <b>to</b> come <b>see</b> <b>me.</b> I fight hard for my baby..." ...|$|R

500|$|Though {{the lyrics}} of the song like [...] "Do you want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> down on my knees?" [...] portray female helplessness, the video {{performance}} acts as a counter-text to it. When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling {{on the road in}} front of the advancing car, then turns her head back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E
500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does it make you feel good <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|Burton [...] "loved the idea" [...] {{of playing}} a {{character}} [...] "very different" [...] from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as [...] "Stone Cold". The role of Dylan {{allowed him to}} wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's [...] "uniform" [...] and [...] "black T-shirt", Burton described the experience as [...] "refreshing". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do my hair different, because I know people are always going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> as Jason." ...|$|E

There was one Frau sicked her dog onto me, and I {{kicked him in the}} jaw and---- Oh, it was one swell hike." ...|$|R
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} {{for a number of}} years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, acknowledging that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> I'd get sick... I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be mad at me... But I do love him." [...] In Jackson's other high profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.|$|E
500|$|After Bennett's {{first visit}} to Germany there {{followed}} three extended visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his Naiads overture. During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany, ("as fitting a Yorkshireman" [...] as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison: took me to his house and gave me the printed score of [...] 'Melusina', and afterwards we supped at the 'Hôtel de Bavière', where all the musical clique feed... The party consist of Mendelssohn, [...] David, Stamity ... and a Mr. Schumann, a musical editor, who expected <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> a fat man with large black whiskers.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} three pick up beats as André 3000 counts [...] "one, two, three, oh" [...] and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics begin to {{describe}} the protagonist's concerns and doubts about a romantic relationship. He wonders if they are staying together just [...] "for tradition", as in the lines [...] "But does she really wanna [...] / But can't stand <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> / Walk out the door?" [...] André 3000 commented, [...] "I think it's more important to be happy than to meet up to...the world's expectations of what a relationship should be. So this is a celebration of how men and women {{relate to each other}} in the 2000s". The song then leads into the chorus, which consists of the line [...] "Hey ya!" [...] repeated eight times, accompanied by a synthesizer performing the bassline.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was silent}} under the {{pleasure}} of his praise, and he went on: [...] "I know I'm better, and, I'm perfectly certain I can regain my strength. The very odor of these pines {{and the power of}} these winds will bring it back <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>See</b> <b>me</b> now, and think how I looked when I came here six weeks ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to get}} out of this," [...] said Graham to Asano. [...] "This is {{not what}} I came <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Show <b>me</b> the workers. I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the people in blue. These {{parasitic}} lunatics--" ...|$|R

500|$|As {{a congressman}} for three months, Greeley {{introduced}} legislation for a homestead act {{that would allow}} settlers who improved land to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This {{was enough to make}} him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848 the Tribune published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported {{a bill that would have}} corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had [...] "divided the House into two parties—one that would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me.</b> I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely {{you are the}} man," [...] went on Henchard insistingly, [...] "who {{arranged}} <b>to</b> {{come and}} <b>see</b> <b>me?</b> Joshua, Joshua, Jipp--Jopp--what was his name?" ...|$|R

500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're not going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|Winrich Kolbe, the {{director}} of [...] "Caretaker", was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans {{who were in the}} Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the [...] "Caretaker" [...] script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience, [...] "I felt neutral about the audition, didn't much care one way or the other. I went in the first time and wasn't really trying to get the part. They asked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> again, and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Limp Bizkit {{was leading}} ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others. But some {{days before the}} event, Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: [...] "Can't wait <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA {{impressions}} in the top deck mosh pit." [...] Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying [...] "When I first read {{the description of the}} cruise I realised {{it is what it is}} and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit. I think that is going to happen though so I feel safe. I'm turning 40 next week and I think it's funny that I'm spending the last week of my [...] on ShipRocked. It's funny to me. It's a joke with truth in it. I just don't want our fans to get all butthurt and thinking I'm criticising them, because I'm not." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} fixed on me his spectacles: A {{resolute}} compression of the lips, and {{gathering of the}} brow, seemed {{to say that he}} meant <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through <b>me,</b> and that a veil would be no veil for him.|$|R
