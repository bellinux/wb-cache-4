In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning bock at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the main sail becomes full.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that sliding mode control is capable of <b>tackling</b> <b>systems</b> with uncertainties.

An algorithm is proposed in this paper to eliminate chattering by removing the discontinuous control signal when the system is operating near the sliding plane.

This algorithm is applied to a system with parameter uncertainties to show its ability and merits. Department of Electrical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: P. K. S.

The chosen site at Middle Hill was leveled and work was begun on a road to access the highest point of the North Face. However, the endeavour required some time, and the enthusiastic artillery gunners became impatient, not wanting to wait for completion of the new road. On their own initiative, they utilised a block and <b>tackle</b> <b>system</b> to drag a 24-pounder up {{the face of the}} Rock. After several days and much effort, they were successful. The platform for the gun was completed on 12 October 1779 and the gun was mounted on a traversing carriage. Firing from the battery began the following day. The emplacement was named Rock Gun Battery. From that elevated vantage point, the gunners were able to observe the operations of the enemy and fire upon the Spanish camp.The emplacement was rebuilt during the Second World War by the Black Watch, and a platform for anti-aircraft guns was constructed {{at the edge of the}} North Face. In the mid-twentieth century, the site shifted to one of radio transmission. In 1958, the Rock Gun radar and Middle Hill aerial transmitter site were refurbished and rebuilt. The work was undertaken by the GRISLY Squadron, more formally the Ground Radio Installation Squadron, of the Radio Engineering Unit of RAF Henlow. Rock Gun Battery was the site of 90-foot wooden towers with VHF and UHF aerials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a reservation-based real-time CPU scheduler. Subject to system overloads, scheduling errors occur {{and result in}} two different system modes according to the error accumulated as time goes by. Hence, {{the dynamics of the}} scheduler should be studied as a switched system. Also, reducing the generated errors to a desired level can be accomplished via feedback control scheme. To summarize, we model the scheduler of interest as a feedback-controlled switched system with bounded time-varying uncertainty. We provide an explicit form of the switched system and analyze its stability by Laypunov function. Using linear matrix inequalities (LMI), we find a feedback controller which stabilizes the switched system. We propose a unified framework to <b>tackle</b> <b>systems</b> having two characteristics: 1) switched systems, and 2) systems with bounded time-varying uncertainty.
