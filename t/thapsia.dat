40|$|The Pleurotus eryngii species {{complex is}} an {{economically}} important group which includes several closely related varieties, whose genetic discrimination {{is still not}} clear. One hundred and ten Italian strains of Pleurotus eryngii belonging to the varieties elaeoselini, eryngii, ferulae and <b>thapsiae</b> and P. nebrodensis were analysed by sequencing two housekeeping genes (ef 1 -a and rpb 2), {{in order to find}} molecular markers for the identification of different varieties. Sequence analysis of partial ef 1 -a and rpb 2 genes, allowed identification of some conserved nucleotide positions within each variety but variable among var. elaeoselini, var. eryngii, var. ferulae var. <b>thapsiae</b> and P. nebrodensis, allowing their discrimination. Phylogenetic analysis from the data of the two genes data set showed that var. elaeoselini, var. <b>thapsiae,</b> var. ferulae and var. eryngii are closely related to each other, and confirm P. nebrodensis as a separate clade...|$|R
40|$|The Pleurotus eryngii species-complex {{comprises}} choice edible mushrooms {{growing on}} roots and lower stem residues of Apiaceae (umbellifers) plants. Material deriving from extensive sampling was studied by mating compatibility, morphological and ecological criteria, and through analysis of ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 and IGS 1 rRNA sequences. Results revealed that P. eryngii sensu stricto forms a diverse and widely distributed aggregate composed of varieties elaeoselini, eryngii, ferulae, <b>thapsiae,</b> and tingitanus. Pleurotus eryngii subsp. tuoliensis comb. nov. is a phylogenetically sister {{group to the}} former growing only on various Ferula species in Asia. The existence of Pleurotus nebrodensis outside of Sicily (i. e., in Greece) is reported {{for the first time}} on the basis of molecular data, while P. nebrodensis subsp. fossulatus comb. nov. is a related Asiatic taxon associated with the same plant (Prangos ferulacea). Last, Pleurotus ferulaginis sp. nov. grows on Ferulago campestris in northeast Italy, Slovenia and Hungary; it occupies a distinct phylogenetic position accompanied with significant differences in spore size and mating incompatibility versus other Pleurotus populations. Coevolution with umbellifers and host/substrate specificity seem to play key roles in speciation processes within this fungal group. An identification key to the nine Pleurotus taxa growing in association with Apiaceae plants is provided...|$|R
50|$|The {{medicinal}} {{properties of}} the members of the genus <b>Thapsia</b> has been recognized as early 300 BC. In traditional medicine, the roots of <b>Thapsia</b> villosa were used as a purgative and emetic. Resin from the <b>Thapsia</b> villosa was used as a blister-producing agent (vesicant) or a counterirritant, similar to resin derived from <b>Thapsia</b> garganica. In Spain, the resin is also traditionally used in Segarra as treatment for scabies. Poultices made from root bark infused with oil was used as a pain-reliever and for treating rheumatism. These were also used in Salamanca for treating cracks in horse hooves.|$|E
50|$|Poison {{from the}} roots of <b>Thapsia</b> villosa is {{traditionally}} used by fishermen in Catalonia as an ichthyotoxin for stunning fish, making them easier to catch. Extracts from the root bark of <b>Thapsia</b> villosa have been used since ancient times as a yellow dye. In the 18th century, yellow dye from the flowers were used to color wool. <b>Thapsia</b> villosa are also grown as ornamentals for their bright yellow flowers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thapsia</b> villosa {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum (1753). It is classified under the genus <b>Thapsia,</b> subfamily Apioideae, of the carrot and parsley family Apiaceae. Two varieties are recognized: T. villosa var. villosa and T. villosa var. dissecta.|$|E
5000|$|The {{generic name}} <b>Thapsia</b> {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek name θαψία (<b>thapsía)</b> for the members of the genus. The Greeks believe it to have {{originated}} from ancient Thapsos in Sicily. The specific epithet is from Latin [...] ("hairy" [...] or [...] "shaggy").|$|E
50|$|The {{generic name}} <b>Thapsia</b> {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek name θαψία (<b>thapsía)</b> for the members of the genus. The Greeks believe it to have {{originated}} from ancient Thapsos in Sicily. It {{has a long history of}} being used in ancient traditional medicine. Algerians used it as a pain-reliever though they recognized that the plant was deadly to camels. The Greek colony of Cyrene exported a medicinal plant known as silphion, used as a purgative and emetic. Although its exact identity remains contentious today, some historians believe that the plant may have been <b>Thapsia</b> garganica.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thapsia</b> troglodytes is {{a species}} of {{air-breathing}} land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicarionidae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thapsia</b> was {{originally}} designated in 1860 by German zoologist Johann Christian Albers as a subgenus of Nanina Gray, 1834, non Risso, 1826.|$|E
50|$|About nine {{species of}} <b>Thapsia</b> are {{currently}} recognized. It is, however, a complex genus, and some authors may recognize different numbers of species.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{medicinal}} {{uses of the}} plant, however, are {{now considered}} largely ineffective and highly inadvisable due to the danger posed by the poisons of <b>Thapsia</b> villosa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thapsia</b> grandis is {{a species}} of {{air-breathing}} land snail or semi-slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicarionidae. This species is endemic to Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thapsia</b> villosa, {{commonly}} known as the villous deadly carrot, is a species of poisonous herbaceous plants in the genus <b>Thapsia.</b> It grows to about 70 to 190 cm in height. It has pinnate hairy leaves with sheath-like petioles. The flowers are yellow in color and borne on compound umbels. They develop into fruits with four wings characteristic of the genus. It is native to southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The plant was used extensively for traditional medicine since around the 3rd century BC.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thapsia</b> villosa {{is highly}} {{variable}} in morphology. The two varieties, T. villosa var. dissecta and T. villosa var. villosa are usually distinguished {{by how many}} times the leaf subdivides into leaflets. T. villosa var. dissecta has leaves that are deeply subdivided {{two or three times}} into narrow and small leaflets. T. villosa var. villosa, in contrast are usually subdivided only once or twice. However, there are numerous intermediate forms between the two varieties and distinguishing between them can be very difficult. The diploid chromosome number (2n) of <b>Thapsia</b> villosa is 22, 33, 44, or 66.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thapsia</b> is a genus of {{air-breathing}} land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in {{the family}} Helicarionidae. Species in this genus are found in tropical western Africa, from Senegal to Gabon.|$|E
5000|$|Thapsigargin is non-competitive {{inhibitor}} of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). [...] Structurally, thapsigargin {{is classified}} as a sesquiterpene lactone, and is extracted from a plant, <b>Thapsia</b> garganica. It is a tumor promoter in mammalian cells.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Rumex, Corylus, Plantago and Rubus species, {{but have}} also been {{recorded}} feeding on various grasses (including Festuca and Anthoxanthum) as well as <b>Thapsia,</b> Taraxacum, Urtica and Sonchus species, and even hay and paper.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thapsia</b> buraensis is {{a species}} of {{air-breathing}} land snail or semi-slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicarionidae. This species is endemic to Kenya. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests; it is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thapsia,</b> {{commonly}} known as the deadly carrots, is a small genus of poisonous plants in the family Apiaceae. Their center of diversity is around the western Mediterranean, extending into the Atlantic coasts of Portugal and Morocco. Some species are used in traditional medicine.|$|E
50|$|Species of <b>Thapsia</b> are {{herbaceous}} perennials, growing 50 to 200 cm high. The inflorescences are large, regularly distributed umbels. The seeds {{have four}} wings, {{and are the}} main characteristic of the genus, which is distributed in the Mediterranean, on the Iberian peninsula, and North Africa.|$|E
50|$|The adults {{grow up to}} 7 - 10 mm long, {{while the}} {{wingspan}} reaches 5 - 15 mm. They can mostly be encountered from May through August feeding on nectar and pollen {{of a variety of}} flowers (for instance of Lavandula stoechas, Cytisus scoparius, <b>Thapsia</b> villosa, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most members}} of the family Apiaceae, <b>Thapsia</b> villosa flowers early, during the months of May, June, and July. The flowers are pollinated by a variety of insects. The flowers develop into winged fruits that dry out around August, while other members of the family are usually still in bloom.|$|E
50|$|This genus is a {{heterogeneous}} assemblage. Because the shell characters of this genus converge {{with those of}} the larger specimens of some closely related genera (Saphtia Winter, 2008, Pseudosaphtia Winter, 2008 and Vanmolia Winter, 2008), the delimitation of species to <b>Thapsia</b> s.l. is difficult. There very few papers that describe the anatomical features of this genus.|$|E
