In 1911, after 10 years of experimenting and failures, <b>Tangüis</b> was able to develop a seed which produced a superior cotton plant resistant to the disease. The seeds produced a plant that had a 40% longer (between 29mm and 33mm) and thicker fiber that did not break easily and required little water. The cotton grown in Peru (Egyptian cotton) before the fungus plague grew only once a year; the <b>Tangüis</b> cotton grows six times a year. This type of fiber showed a better resistance and performance than other fibers.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th {{century the}} economies of many {{countries}} in the world suffered from the spread of crop failures. Puerto Rico, whose economy depended heavily on its agriculture, felt the effects of some of the crop diseases. Scientists such as Dr. Agustín Stahl, Fermín <b>Tangüis</b> and Fernando López Tuero conducted investigations and experiments in the fields of agriculture, botany, ethnology and zoology. The findings of their investigations helped Puerto Rico's agricultural industry.|$|E

2500|$|Fermín <b>Tangüis</b> (1851–1930) was a Puerto Rican businessman, {{agriculturist}} and {{scientist who}} in 1901 developed the seed {{that would eventually}} produce the <b>Tanguis</b> cotton in Peru when that nation's cotton industry suffered because of a fungus plague caused by a plant disease known some places as [...] "cotton wilt" [...] and in others as [...] "Fusarium wilt" [...] (Fusarium vasinfectum) saving that nation's cotton industry.|$|E

He {{discovered}} the aphid [...] "Aphis maidis", the vector of the sugar cane Mosaic virus. Mosaic viruses are plant viruses.

This type of fiber showed a better resistance and performance than other fibers.Tangüis shared his new seeds with the other cotton growers, who named the plant which the seeds produced <b>Tangüis</b> Cotton. <b>Tangüis</b> cotton grows in Canete’s valley (south of Lima) and in the Central Coast of Peru. The success of the <b>Tangüis</b> cotton, which is also known in Peru as [...] "Oro Blanco" [...] (White Gold), saved the cotton industry of that nation. In 1918, Peru began to export the <b>Tangüis</b> cotton variety, which together with the exportation of sugar, made it possible for the government of Peru to cover its national budget. It is highly regarded worldwide and is listed on the Cotton Exchange of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. In 1997, the <b>Tanguis</b> cotton, the variety which is preferred by the Peruvian national textile industry, constituted 75 percent of all the Peruvian cotton production, both for domestic use and apparel exports. The <b>Tanguis</b> cotton crop was estimated at 225,000 bales that year.|$|E

In 1985, Dr. Alberto Giesecke, {{committee}} member of the Cosapi National Prize, suggested that books be published about the lives and accomplishments of Peru's civilian heroes.

Dr. Gualberto Ruaño is a biotechnology {{pioneer in the}} field of personalized medicine and the inventor of molecular diagnostic systems, Coupled Amplification and Sequencing (CAS) System, used worldwide for the management of viral diseases. Fermín <b>Tangüis</b> was an agriculturist and scientist who developed the <b>Tangüis</b> Cotton in Peru and saved that nation's cotton industry. Severo Ochoa, born in Spain, was a co-winner of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Sarah Stewart, a Mexican-American Microbiologist, is credited with the discovery of the Polyomavirus and successfully demonstrating that cancer causing viruses could be transmitted from animal to animal. Mexican-American psychiatrist Dr. Nora Volkow, whose brain imaging studies helped characterize the mechanisms of drug addiction, is the current director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Dr. Helen Rodríguez Trías, an early advocate for women's reproductive rights, helped drive and draft U.S. federal sterilization guidelines in 1979. She was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton, and was the first Latina president of the American Public Health Association.|$|E

The drama traces a rural Puerto Rican family as it moved to the slums of San Juan and then to New York in search of a better life, only to be disillusioned and to long for their island.
