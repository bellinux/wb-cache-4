5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E

Thomas and Brown (2011 : 17) present a worldview of learning in the 21 st century, suggesting learning is “around us, everywhere ” and term the phenomenon to be the “new culture of learning”. The discourse in this paper is centred on drawing a comparative analysis of traditional and contemporary management perspectives, as they relate <b>to</b> <b>engendering</b> a culture of learning within institutions {{in order to deal with}} the challenges presented by a 21 st century of unprecedented contextual complexity. The methodology adopted in compiling this paper is analytically-descriptive in nature and is based on a multi-disciplinary literature study. The literature analysis revealed a fundamental difference between an “ordered” and “complex ” system approached in engendering a culture of learning. An important finding stemming from the literature study is that traditional ordered paradigms relating <b>to</b> <b>engendering</b> a culture of learning in contemporary institutions may no longer be effective and the adoption of a complex systems approach is suggested...|$|R

This paper {{focuses on the}} topic of trust and how agents may bias their interactions based upon implicit trust. We define implicit trust as that which is conveyed through the utilities of a simple game offer. We introduce this concept of implicit trust and present our motivations for examining this phenomenon. We define a game theoretic framework, including possible strategy sets and a game environment. We outline a series of experiments which illustrate the effects of implicit trust. Finally, we draw conclusions based on the experimental results presented. I...|$|R
25|$|Sir William George Granville Venables Vernon Harcourt, KC (14 October 1827 – 1 October 1904) was a British lawyer, {{journalist}} and Liberal statesman. He served as Member of Parliament for various constituencies {{and held the}} offices of Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under William Ewart Gladstone before becoming Leader of the Opposition. A talented speaker in parliament, he was sometimes regarded as aloof and possessing only an intellectual involvement in his causes. He failed <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> much emotional response in the public and became only a reluctant and disillusioned leader of his party.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} episode proved counterproductive {{in several}} respects. It ruined {{the prospects for}} genuine racial partnership, made heroes out of the detainees, and alienated moderate Africans from the Government. Indeed, black opposition at this point started to become violent. Repression of the black majority by the white minority had helped <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> the terrorism that would haunt the country for decades. To deflate the crisis atmosphere {{of the state of}} emergency and yet preserve its sweeping powers as insurance against the future, the regime sought to normalise the exceptional measures, by incorporating them in statute law. Thus nstitutionalised, the official emergency came to an end.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{probably}} {{abandoned his}} plans for Bernard and instead adopted Louis of Provence as his son at an assembly at Kirchen in May.

In June or July Berengar arrived in Kirchen, probably pining to be declared Charles's heir; he may in fact have been so named in Italy, where he was acclaimed (or made himself) king immediately after Charles's deposition. Odo, Count of Paris, {{may have had a}} similar purpose in visiting Charles at Kirchen. On the other hand, the presence of these magnates at these two great assemblies may merely have been necessary to confirm Charles' illegitimate son as his heir (Waiblingen), a plan which failed when the pope refused to attend, and then to confirm Louis instead (Kirchen).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} ethnographic vignettes in an Indian rights-based {{approach}} to adult education programmes {{in order to}} examine the contestations and negotiations of facilitators in interface situations involving programme capacity building, monitoring and evaluation practice. The paper proposes that making visible the hegemonic nature of relationships between different adult education actors is critical <b>to</b> <b>engendering</b> democratic participation in adult education. It explores conditions of possibility for democratic participation in adult education in terms of (1) conceptualising empowerment as self-representation and autonomy; and (2) interrogating one’s identity through self-deconstruction as an ethical responsibility and commitment to equity and social justice. This analysis has implications for informing and enhancing democratic participation in adult education capacity building, monitoring and evaluation processes...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} paper addresses prevailing conceptualisations of women's {{agency in}} leisure. It {{focuses on the}} reproduction/resistance framework characteristic of much feminist work. Realising the role of leisure in reproducing oppressive gender relations and the various ways that leisure can also resist them {{is vital to the}} continual politicisation of leisure, however we explore whether this framework can always adequately realise the complexities of women's lived relations <b>to</b> <b>engendered</b> power. We specifically focus on the conceptual relationship between empowerment and resistance. Using the illustration of one woman's auto/biography lodged with the Mass Observation Archive, we question whether women's empowerment is derived from a contextual repositioning to gendered norms and an agency which neither resists nor straightforwardly reproduces gender relations...|$|R
25|$|On {{a tour of}} Europe, Everaert {{noticed that}} European teams named after their {{respective}} town or city seemed to generate more support from fans in their communities. So, in 1908, {{with the approval of}} Everaert and the players, Club de Futbol Union was renamed as Club Deportivo Guadalajara <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> a sense of loyalty within the city's population. In 1908, it was also decided that the team would only field Mexican-born players because of the growing sense of oppression Mexican nationals felt towards non-Mexican nationals. Following the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution, amateur football tournaments throughout the country flourished and Guadalajara was always involved. Between 1906 and 1943 (the amateur era of Mexican football and the Primera Fuerza), Guadalajara won 13 amateur titles, the first in 1908. Also during this period, the oldest rivalry in Mexican football began to form, between Guadalajara and Atlas.|$|E
25|$|During and {{following}} the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the Permian Basin (North America), helped <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, oil refining, {{and the proliferation of}} low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of region's rural population, which was mostly white, to cities like El Paso, brought a short term burst of capital and labor. However, this was balanced by additional departures of middle class Americans {{to other parts of the}} country which offered new and better paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 saw the bracero program which brought in cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the native white population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the post-war expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In 1636 the Manchus proclaimed their dynasty as the Qing dynasty and by 1644 {{they had}} {{completed}} their conquest of China under the prince regent Dorgon. The following year their forces approached Amdo on northern Tibet, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing invited the Fifth Dalai Lama {{to visit their}} court at Beijing since they wished <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> Tibetan influence in their dealings with the Mongols. The Qing were aware the Dalai Lama had extraordinary influence with the Mongols and saw relations with the Dalai Lama {{as a means to}} facilitate submission of the Khalka Mongols, traditional patrons of the Karma Kagyu sect. Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a priest-patron relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the Qing invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the emperor or his representatives should meet the Dalai Lama inside or outside the Great Wall, when the meeting would be astrologically favourable, how it would be conducted and so on, it eventually took place in Beijing in 1653. The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of Dorgon. For the Qing, although the Dalai Lama was not required to kowtow to the emperor, who rose from his throne and advanced 30 feet to meet him, the significance of the visit was that of nominal political submission by the Dalai Lama since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians however it was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of Qing patronage alongside that of the Mongols.|$|E

500|$|The {{middle of}} the 20th century saw {{a number of very}} {{important}} changes in American popular music. [...] The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period, as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry. [...] As a result, music marketing became more and more prominent, resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of. [...] Many of the first such stars were Italian-American crooners like Dean Martin, Rudy Vallee, Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frankie Laine and, most famously, the [...] "first pop vocalist <b>to</b> <b>engender</b> hysteria among his fans" [...] Frank Sinatra. The era of the modern teen pop star, however, began in the 1960s. Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records, with no regard to musical ability. [...] The same period, however, also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music, including rock, soul and pop-folk. By the end of the 1960s, two developments had completely changed popular music: the birth of a counterculture, which explicitly opposed mainstream music, often in tandem with political and social activism, and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both singers and songwriters.|$|E
50|$|The {{empowerment}} of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with gender inequality. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies. In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty, policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men. In addition <b>to</b> <b>engendering</b> poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the World Bank, suggesting that promoting gender equality through {{empowerment of}} women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.|$|R
