5|$|In {{the good}} time coming, the refining, elevating, and {{strengthening}} influences of high intellectual and aesthetic culture {{will be considered}} as desirable in the agricultural profession {{as they are in}} medicine, law or theology... If practical farmers are to remain ignorant of all the higher branches of learning, and to have only the mental discipline and culture of the country public schools, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> occupy their proper position in society.|$|E
5|$|Writing to Samsu, Nurbaya {{tells him}} that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be together. However, after {{surviving}} Meringgih's increasingly violent outbursts, she runs away to Batavia to be with Samsu. They fall in love again. Upon receiving a letter regarding her father's death, Nurbaya hurries back to Padang, where she dies after unwittingly eating a cake poisoned by Meringgih's men on his orders. Receiving news of her death by letter, Samsu seemingly commits suicide.|$|E

5000|$|The game is {{traditionally}} called Dyut or Chaupar [...] It {{is similar to}} Ludo. The game however had different rules including staking wealth. Kshatriyas (those of royal families) {{used to have a}} pact that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> however <b>never</b> refuse to play Dyut. Hence this led to the fall of Yudhistir who could not leave the game mid-way.|$|R
5|$|After {{learning}} {{about his past}} life, Harsha is rescued from the lake by a fisherman named Solomon (who is the reincarnation of Sher Khan) and, with Soloman's help, visits Udayghad. He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of the past are not revived within the day <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be revived, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha. Harsha fights Raghuveer, {{and with the help}} of Solomon, manages to kill him.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be together because they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E
5|$|There {{do exist}} orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for {{the age of}} the Solar System. These {{resonances}} occur when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known objects, is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects, Pluto, is among them. Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> collide. The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.|$|E

60|$|There {{is a most}} {{singular}} contrariety {{of opinion}} prevailing in the community, {{in regard to the}} pleasantness of the business of teaching. Some teachers go to their daily task, merely upon compulsion: they regard it as intolerable drudgery. Others love the work: they hover around the school-room as long as <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>never</b> cease to think, and seldom to talk, of their delightful labors.|$|R
25|$|The album's concept explores a story {{questioning}} {{morality and}} {{both sides of the}} Libra Scale: the decision between money/power/fame versus love. The story follows three garbage men – Jerome, Clyde and Leroy – who are offered everything they have wanted in return for protecting the city against a forthcoming threat. However, there's a catch: <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> fall in love. When Jerome (Ne-Yo) falls for Pretti Sinclair (Galen Hooks) disaster ensues, and he has to choose between his love for her and the fame, power and money that he had been given, as he must choose between her life and his own.|$|E
25|$|The ocelli {{of insects}} bear a simple lens, but their focal point always lies behind the retina; {{consequently}} <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> form a sharp image. Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image {{across the whole}} retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush {{the information to the}} brain. Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image to be focused on a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|An {{explanation}} for this log-normal distribution for biological parameters is: The event where a sample has half {{the value of the}} mean or median tends to have almost equal probability to occur as the event where a sample has twice the value of the mean or median. Also, only a log-normal distribution can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of negative numbers (at least when measured on absolute scales), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size of outliers (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be less than zero, resulting in a positive skewness.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} these resolutions, had <b>they</b> been passed, <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be known. Unfortunately, Burke {{delivered}} this speech just {{less than a month}} before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington, and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict.|$|R

25|$|In {{the very}} act of conceiving and {{creating}} his city in the northern swamps, Peter has imposed order on the primeval natural scene depicted {{at the beginning of the}} poem. The city itself, ‘graceful yet austere’ in its classical design, is, as much as the Falconet statue, Peter’s living monument, carrying on his struggle against the ‘wild, tumultuous’ Finnish waves.Its granite banks may hold the unruly elements in check for most of the time, but even they are helpless against such a furious rebellion as the flood of 1824. The waves’ victory is, admittedly, short-lived: the flood soon recedes and the city returns to normal. Even so, it is clear that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be decisively defeated;they live to fight another day.|$|E
25|$|Turing {{discovers that}} Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross {{argues that the}} Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by {{disclosing}} Turing’s homosexuality if his role as an agent is revealed. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already, and planted Cairncross among {{them in order to}} leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay and lying about never having cared for her. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> see one another again or share what they have done.|$|E
25|$|Public Part C Medicare Advantage {{health plan}} members {{typically}} usually also pay a monthly premium {{in addition to}} the Medicare Part B premium to cover items not covered by traditional Medicare (Parts A & B), such as the OOP limit, prescription drugs, dental care, vision care, annual physicals, coverage outside the United States, and even gym or health club memberships as well as—and probably most importantly—reduce the 20% co-pays and high deductibles associated with Original Medicare. But in some situations the benefits are more limited (but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be more limited than Original Medicare and must always include an OOP limit) and there is no premium. In some cases, the insurer even rebates part or all of the Part B premium, though these types of Part C plans are becoming rare.|$|E

500|$|If {{indifference}} curves for purchases {{be thought}} of as possessing a wavy character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others are essentially unobservable. They can be detected only by the discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> measure their depth.

500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything away from you / But <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> take away your truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E
500|$|Peter and Lois {{are leaving}} a doctor's office when actor Ryan Reynolds asks them for directions. He seems very appreciative of Peter. The next morning Peter notices that Ryan has moved in across the street, taking Cleveland Brown's former residence. Ryan says he's filming {{for a movie}} nearby. Peter attends Ryan's housewarming party that night, at which Ryan tickles him and {{requests}} that he return the favor. [...] Later that week, they go out to dinner, but Peter immediately exits the restaurant when Ryan tries to kiss him. The next day, Peter tells Lois he believes Ryan is gay but Lois rejects the idea. Peter confronts Ryan, who replies that he is only attracted to Peter's spirit {{in the way that}} a man is attracted to a woman. Angered by Peter's accusation, Ryan orders him to leave and that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> talk again—but hands him a cell phone so they can [...] "always talk".|$|E

500|$|Vaccination {{is a way}} of {{preventing}} diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease. Their use has resulted in the eradication of smallpox and a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccines are available to prevent over fourteen viral infections of humans and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses. Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, but these vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with weak immunity. In these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce [...] "designer" [...] vaccines that only have the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. These vaccines are safer because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> cause the disease.|$|E
500|$|The villagers {{continue}} the harvest festivities, and Albrecht emerges again {{to dance with}} Giselle, who is named the Harvest Queen. Hilarion interrupts the festivities. He has discovered Albrecht's finely made sword and presents it as proof that the lovesick peasant boy is really a nobleman who is promised to another woman. Using Albrecht's hunting horn, Hilarion calls back the party of noblemen. Albrecht has no time to hide and {{has no choice but}} to greet Bathilde as his betrothed. All are shocked by the revelation, but none more than Giselle, who becomes inconsolable when faced with her lover's deception. Knowing that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> be together, Giselle flies into a mad fit of grief in which all the tender moments she shared with [...] "Loys" [...] flash before her eyes. She begins to dance erratically, causing her weak heart to give out. She dies in Albrecht's arms. Hilarion and Albrecht turn on each other in rage before Albrecht flees the scene in misery. The curtain closes as Berthe weeps over her daughter's body.|$|E
500|$|There {{was a scene}} {{cut from}} [...] "33" [...] where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken {{on the roof of}} the capitol {{building}} on Aerilon during the attack. The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>never</b> forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) as he stands on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, [...] "Lest We Forget" [...] in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.|$|E
