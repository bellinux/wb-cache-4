The number of hours per week <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> i spends with cohort j is described by entry Rij of a matrix R given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during {{which he or she}} is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is NP-complete, even when each teacher has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable vij corresponds to an hour <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> i must spend with cohort j, the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher {{at the same time as}} each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.|$|E

Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was [...] "vicious". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne.|$|E

[...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E

He succeeded, and by these efforts he raised himself from being a mere laborer, receiving for his daily toil a mere daily subsistence, to the respectability and the comforts of an intellectual pursuit. But this change once produced, he stops short in his progress. Once seated in his desk, he is satisfied, and for twenty years he has been going through the same routine, without any effort to advance or to improve. He does not reflect that the same efforts, which so essentially altered his condition and prospects at twenty, would have carried him forward to higher and higher sources of influence and enjoyment, as long as he should continue them. His efforts ceased when he obtained a situation as teacher, at forty dollars a month, and though twenty years have glided away, he is now exactly what he was then.|$|E

He, who is called in this book God, they would call God-the-Son or Christ, or the Logos; and what is here called the Darkness or the Veiled Being, they would call God-the-Father. And what we speak of here as Life, they would call, with a certain disregard of the poor brutes that perish, Man. And they would assert, what we of the new belief, pleading our profound ignorance, would neither assert nor deny, that that Darkness, out of which came Life and God, since it produced them must be ultimately sympathetic and of like nature with them. And that ultimately Man, being redeemed and led by Christ and saved from death by him, would be reconciled with God the Father.* And this great adventurer out of the hearts of man that we here call God, they would present as the same with <b>that</b> <b>teacher</b> from Galilee who was crucified at Jerusalem.|$|E
