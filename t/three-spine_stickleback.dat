5000|$|Fish territory, or {{in another}} word, defended areas are {{generally}} {{ruled by a}} single individual or by breeding pairs. The guarded resource may include food, shelter, sexual partner or offspring. While protecting their regions, fish often display aggressive behavior against their intruders. The territory owner strikes at competing fish directly ending in a bite, or a bump. Such aggressive behavior is seen in large juveniles, females and other fish {{of the same kind}} from the same area. To better understand this topic, consider the male <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback,</b> Gasterosteus aculeatus, as an example. Theo Bakker's paper claims the <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> male fish is polygynous—meaning they prefer two or more female mates in a territory. Thus, males are highly aggressive so they have access to females in a particular territory, which also leads to intrasexual selection among males. Intrasexual selection is selection within the same sex. For instance, some male animals compete against one another, physically, for access to females for their kind. So, characters like big tail, sharp teeth or similar weaponry that can be used against other males of the same species as means of mating with females is a selective advantage.|$|E

40|$|The <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> is an {{adaptable}} {{fish with}} variation in morphology and behaviour, inhabiting saltwater, brackish water and fresh water. It is armoured with 30 - 35 bone plates along its lateral line. In addition, it {{is equipped with}} three spines on its back and two pelvic spine. These features constitute an excellent anti-predator defence system. Yet, {{there is a strong}} selection for reduction in armour of <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> in freshwater stickleback. In this project, the bone structure and lateral plate of 72 <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> from salt, brackish and fresh water was compared. Three-dimensional description of bone structures was accomplished by the use of micro-computed tomography (µ-CT). The results reveal that three-spine sticklebacks in freshwater may not only reduced number of plates, but also decreased the size and thickness of the armour plates...|$|E

Leidy reported the fish still inhabiting the Adobe Creek's lowest reach in 2007 – native California roach (Lavinia symmetricus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), <b>three-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis).

40|$|A species's niche width {{reflects}} {{a balance between}} the diversifying effects of intraspecific competition and the constraining effects of interspecific competition. This balance shifts when a species from a competitive environment invades a depauperate habitat where interspecific competition is reduced. The resulting ecological release permits population niche expansion, via increased individual niche widths and/or increased among-individual variation. We report an experimental test of the theory of ecological release in <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We factorially manipulated {{the presence or absence of}} two interspecific competitors: juvenile cut-throat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Consistent with the classic niche variation hypothesis, release from trout competition increased stickleback population niche width via increased among-individual variation, while individual niche widths remained unchanged. In contrast, release from sculpin competition had no effect on population niche width, because increased individual niche widths were offset by decreased between-individual variation. Our results confirm that ecological release from interspecific competition can lead to increases in niche width, and that these changes can occur on behavioural time scales. Importantly, we find that changes in population niche width are decoupled from changes in the niche widths of individuals within the population...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of predators can impact {{a variety of}} organisms within the ecosystem, including microorganisms. Because the effects of fish predators and their phenotypic differences on microbial communities have not received much attention, we tested how the presence/absence, genotype, and plasticity of the predatory <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) influence aquatic microbes in outdoor mesocosms. We reared lake and stream stickleback genotypes on contrasting food resources to adulthood, and then added them to aquatic mesocosm ecosystems to assess {{their impact on the}} planktonic bacterial community. We also investigated whether the effects of fish persisted following the removal of adults, and the subsequent addition of a homogenous juvenile fish population. The {{presence of}} adult stickleback increased the number of bacterial OTUs and altered the size structure of the microbial community, whereas their phenotype affected bacterial community composition. Some of these effects were detectable after adult fish were removed from the mesocosms, and after juvenile fish were placed in the tanks, most of these effects disappeared. Our results suggest that fish can have strong short-term effects on microbial communities that are partially mediated by phenotypic variation of fish...|$|E

Our results showed that both ecological and evolutionary differences in the top-predator affect different aspects of community structure and composition. Community structure, specifically the abundance of organisms at each trophic level, was affected by stickleback presence and density, whereas composition of zooplankton was influenced by stickleback diversity and specialization.

40|$|The {{importance}} of freshwater mussels in stream ecosystems {{is apparent in}} their remarkable ability to effectively cycle nutrients and improve water quality. Listed as a federal species of concern and a candidate species for listing {{in the state of}} Washington, the California Floater (Anodonta californiensis) mussel has potentially significant ecological benefits. This study identifies a suite of suitable host fish species for this mussel, filling a significant data gap for A. californiensis and building a pathway for successful conservation efforts. Using a combination of artificial larval infection of potential host fish in a laboratory setting and field observation techniques, two fish species, speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus) and torrent sculpin (Cottus rhotheus), were confirmed as hosts for A. californiensis. Two more fish species, <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and Redside Shiner (Richardsonius balteatus), were identified as potential hosts for A. californiensis, but confirming either species as a host will require further tests. Previous conservation efforts for A. californiensis may have fallen short without the knowledge of suitable host fish; however, the information obtained from this study can help to develop a holistic watershed management approach that focuses on A. californiensis and its suite of fish hosts in a community context rather than a species-specific strategy...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of five teleostean genomes, namely zebrafish, medaka, <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback,</b> fugu and pufferfish was {{performed with the}} aim to highlight {{the nature of the}} forces driving both length and base composition of introns (i. e., bpi and GCi). An inter-genome approach using orthologous intronic sequences was carried out, analyzing independently both variables in pairwise comparisons. An average length shortening of introns was observed at increasing average GCi values. The result was not affected by masking transposable and repetitive elements harbored in the intronic sequences. The routine metabolic rate (mass specific temperature-corrected using the Boltzmann’s factor) was measured for each species. A significant correlation held between average differences of metabolic rate, length and GC content, while environmental temperature of fish habitat was not correlated with bpi and GCi. Analyzing the concomitant effect of both variables, i. e., bpi and GCi, at increasing genomic GC content, a decrease of bpi and an increase of GCi was observed for the significant majority of the intronic sequences (from, 40 % to, 90 %, in each pairwise comparison).

Catch-per-unit-effort data analysed from 15 years of midwater trawling documented seasonal and diel differences in vertical distributions for each species. These results {{were consistent with}} the hypothesis that the patterns of DVM in Lake Washington were affected by life history, size and morphology. Sockeye salmon showed clear DVM in spring but essentially no DVM in fall, remaining in deep water, whereas three-spine sticklebacks were prevalent at the surface at night in both seasons. In fall, distribution patterns may be explained by differences in thermal performance (e. g., sticklebacks favouring warm water), but the patterns were also consistent with inter-specific differences in predation risk. Younger sockeye salmon and longfin smelt were present in greater proportions higher in the water column during dusk and night periods than older conspecifics. Compared with sockeye salmon, the greater use by three-spine sticklebacks of surface waters throughout the diel cycle during weak thermal stratification in spring was consistent with the hypothesis that sticklebacks’ armour reduces predation risk, but use of this warmer, metabolically beneficial stratum may also have promoted growth. This study illustrates variation in the vertical distribution of three sympatric planktivores and offers broader implications for the DVM phenomenon and applied lake ecology...|$|E

40|$|Although rapid {{phenotypic}} evolution during range expansion {{associated with}} colonization of contrasting habitats {{has been documented}} in several taxa, the evolutionary mechanisms that underlie such phenotypic divergence have less often been investigated. A strong candidate for rapid ecotype formation within an invaded range is the <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> in the Lake Geneva region of central Europe. Since its introduction only about 140 years ago, it has undergone a significant expansion of its range and its niche, now forming phenotypically differentiated parapatric ecotypes that occupy either the pelagic zone of the large lake or small inlet streams, respectively. By comparing museum collections from different times with contemporary population samples, we here reconstruct the evolution of parapatric phenotypic divergence through time. Using genetic data from modern samples, we infer the underlying invasion history. We find that parapatric habitat-dependent phenotypic divergence between the lake and stream was already present {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century, but the magnitude of differentiation increased through time, particularly in antipredator defence traits. This suggests that divergent selection between the habitats occurred and was stable through much of the time since colonization. Recently, increased phenotypic differentiation in antipredator defence traits likely results from habitat-dependent selection on alleles that arrived through introgression from a distantly related lineage from outside the Lake Geneva region. This illustrates how hybridization can quickly promote phenotypic divergence in a system where adaptation from standing genetic variation was constrained. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPaired {{appendages}} were a key developmental innovation among vertebrates {{and they}} eventually evolved into limbs. Ancient developmental control systems for paired fins and limbs are broadly conserved among gnathostome vertebrates. Some lineages including whales, some salamanders, snakes, and many ray-fin fish, independently lost the pectoral, pelvic, or both appendages over evolutionary time. When different taxa independently evolve similar developmental morphologies, do {{they use the}} same molecular genetic mechanisms? To determine the developmental genetic basis {{for the evolution of}} pelvis loss in the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes (fugu), we isolated fugu orthologs of genes thought to be essential for limb development in tetrapods, including limb positioning (Hoxc 6, Hoxd 9), limb bud initiation (Pitx 1, Tbx 4, Tbx 5), and limb bud outgrowth (Shh, Fgf 10), and studied their expression patterns during fugu development. Results showed that bud outgrowth and initiation fail to occur in fugu, and that pelvis loss is associated with altered expression of Hoxd 9 a, which we show to be a marker for pelvic fin position in <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback</b> Gasterosteus aculeatus. These results rule out changes in appendage outgrowth and initiation genes as the earliest developmental defect in pufferfish pelvic fin loss and suggest that altered Hoxd 9 a expression in the lateral mesoderm may account for pelvis loss in fugu. This mechanism appears to be different from the mechanism for pelvic loss in stickleback, showing that different taxa can evolve similar phenotypes by different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|There is {{extensive}} {{evidence that}} some species of ecological generalists, which use a wide diversity of resources, {{are in fact}} heterogeneous collections of relatively specialized individuals. This within-population variation, or "individual specialization," is a key requirement for frequency-dependent interactions that may drive a variety of types of evolutionary diversification and may influence the population dynamics and ecological interactions of species. Consequently, {{it is important to}} understand when individual specialization is likely to be strong or weak. The niche variation hypothesis (NVH) suggests that populations tend to become more generalized when they are released from interspecific competition. This niche expansion was proposed to arise via increased variation among individuals rather than increased individual niche breadth. Consequently, we expect ecological generalists to exhibit stronger individual specialization, but this correlation has been repeatedly rejected by empiricists. The drawback with previous empirical tests of the NVH is that they use morphological variation as a proxy for niche variation, ignoring the role of behavior and complex phenotype-function relationships. Here, we used diet data to directly estimate niche variation among individuals. Consistent with the NVH, we show that more generalized populations also exhibit more niche variation. This trend is quite general, appearing in all five case studies examined: <b>three-spine</b> <b>stickleback,</b> Eurasian perch, Anolis lizards, intertidal gastropods, and a community of neotropical frogs. Our results suggest that generalist populations may tend to be more ecologically variable. Whether this translates into greater genetic variation, evolvability, or ecological stability remains to be determined...|$|E
