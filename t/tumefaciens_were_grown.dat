It also appears that these glucans provide important functions during {{the interactions of}} these bacteria with plant hosts. A large fraction of these glucans may become modified with anionic substituents such as phosphoglycerol or succinic acid; however, the role(s) of these substituents is unknown. In this study, we show that growth of these bacteria in phosphate-limited media leads to a dramatic reduction in the levels of phosphoglycerol substituents present on the periplasmic cyclic (beta) -(1, 2) -glucans. Under these growth conditions, R. meliloti 1021 was found to synthesize anionic cyclic (beta) -(1, 2) -glucans containing only succinic acid substituents. Similar results were obtained with R. meliloti 7154 (an exoH mutant which lacks the ability to succinylate its high-molecular-weight exopolysaccharide), revealing that succinylation of the cyclic (beta) -(1, 2) -glucans is mediated by an enzyme system distinct from that involved in the succinylation of exopolysaccharide.

40|$|Agrobacterium <b>tumefaciens</b> <b>is</b> a Gram-negative bacterium.

40|$|Many {{cellular}} processes critically {{depend on}} the membrane composition. In this review, {{we focus on the}} biosynthesis and physiological roles of membrane lipids in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The major components of A. <b>tumefaciens</b> membranes <b>are</b> the phospholipids (PLs) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin, and ornithine lipids (OLs). Under phosphate-limited conditions, the membrane composition shifts to phosphate-free lipids like glycolipids, OLs and a betaine lipid. Remarkably, PC and OLs have opposing effects on virulence of A. tumefaciens. OL-lacking A. tumefaciens mutants form tumors on the host plant earlier than the wild type suggesting a reduced host defence response in the absence of OLs. In contrast, A. <b>tumefaciens</b> <b>is</b> compromised in tumor formation in the absence of PC. In general, PC is a rare component of bacterial membranes but amount to ~ 22 % of all PLs in A. tumefaciens. PC biosynthesis occurs via two pathways. The phospholipid N-methyltransferase PmtA methylates PE via the intermediates monomethyl-PE and dimethyl-PE to PC. In the second pathway, the membrane-integral enzyme PC synthase (Pcs) condenses choline with CDP-diacylglycerol to PC. Apart from the virulence defect, PC-deficient A. tumefaciens pmtA and pcs double mutants show reduced motility, enhanced biofilm formation and increased sensitivity towards detergent and thermal stress. In summary, there is cumulative evidence that the membrane lipid composition of A. <b>tumefaciens</b> <b>is</b> critical for agrobacterial physiology and tumor formation...|$|R
