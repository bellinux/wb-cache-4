40|$|The storage {{stability}} of unproved lean yeasted frozen bread dough was studied using <b>test</b> <b>baking,</b> physical dough testing, protein analysis and microscopy techniques. Doughs {{with and without}} yeast were prepared according to commercial procedures and stored at - 10 'C, - 20 'C, - 30 'C or under cycling temperatures (between - 10 and - 20 'C) for periods between 1 day and 20 weeks. <b>Test</b> <b>baking</b> results showed that loaf quality (loaf volume and total loaf score) gradually decreased with storage time.

40|$|The aim of {{the milling}} {{industry}} is to provide flours of consistent quality which are optimally matched {{to the requirements of}} the end product. In the case of wheat, {{one of the most difficult}} properties to maintain is consistency of flour performance. Historically, there has been a progressive increase in the mixing requirement, and consequent changes in baking procedures as the storage period of the grain increases. The increase in mixing requirement is not associated with a change in Farinograph water absorption, but is associated with a decrease in the bakery absorption, loss of loaf quality and increased ingredient cost.

40|$|The {{impact of}} salt (sodium chloride) on the wheat dough was studied, with a {{particular}} focus on the state and distribution of water and sodium in the dough system. In this study, dough samples were prepared using the same processing techniques as in commercial bakery (i. e. Chorleywood Bread Process) and were investigated simultaneously using molecular spectroscopy 1 [subscript]H and 23 [subscript]Na NMR), deformation stress measurement (Kieffer test, Texture Profile Analysis and Chen-Hoseney test) and calorimetry (DSC). A progressive study of experimentation {{was carried out in}} which dough samples between zero and 5 % added salt (on flour base) to exaggerate the effects of salt. Furthermore, <b>test</b> <b>baking</b> was also used to study the mechinability of doughs. All of the techniques studied enabled the construction of a complete picture of the sequential events occurring when salt is reduced. <b>Test</b> <b>baking</b> confirmed that machine moulding of bread dough became more difficult at lower salt contents. This was more apparent when dough temperature was elevated, or when the delay time between mixing and moulding was increased. Laboratory measurements were not able to distinguish the increase of stickiness occurring in the low salt (1. 4 %) doughs and modifying the method also failed to establish variations in stickiness, although changes in the hardness of the dough at the different salt levels were detectable. Measurements of the dough fluid phases were compared using three techniques: isolation of aqueous phase through ultracentrifugation, freezable water as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and proton mobility using low field nuclear magnetic resonance (1 [subscript]H NMR). Salt increased the amount of dough liquor expressed on ultracentrifugation, however, the amount of freezable water and the molecular mobility of water (T 2) did not show significant changes. The findings suggest that the gluten-starch matrix is sensitive to salt in way that it affects the "drainage" properties and the capillarity of the dough matrix, but not the intrinsic levels of fluid in the dough. The distribution of salt on the dough was also investigated using 23 [subscript]NaNMR. A large proportion of the salt added was not detectable with this technique and could be thought of as immobile. Increasing the concentration of sodium in the dough gave the same proportion of "bound" sodium. It would seem to be the starch component in the flour that dominated the sodium binding in the dough samples. Salt may exert its effects through polymer-polymer interactions rather than polymer–water interactions and its exact influence on cereal products performance still needs to be established before the reduction of salt is a viable option for commercial bakers.

40|$|Milk fat {{is getting}} more and more {{expensive}} and the demand for natural products is in-creasing. The combination of increased milk price and larger demands from consumers result in that a dairy food company wants to offer consumers a natural blended spread product with excellent butter flavour. A project to develop a recipe for such a product has been carried out. Based on the lit-erature and the company’s collective knowledge of the properties of fats pilot runs for test-ing various recipes, sensory, chemical and bacteriological assessments of the pilot-produced products and <b>test</b> <b>baking</b> with the products was made. The results from the dif-ferent experiments were analysed statistically by multivariate data analysis. Two days conducted for experiments at pilot plant resulted in six different products with different ratios of vegetable fat and butterfat as well as different ratios of fractionated fat. The changing of the type of fat in the product was done to get a product with the right taste, hardness and other desired properties. After sensory, bacteriological, chemical and baking analysis of the products it was seen that one of the products was better than the others when comparing it to the reference products used. The project has resulted in a product recipe to work on to see if the product is to pack in foil. If a product with the same characteristics as reference product one is to be developed it is probably needed to fraction the fat or to ad a stabilizer/emulsifier as this will flatten the melting curve and particularly increase the proportion of solid fat at the higher tem-peratures.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteFadi Aramouniβ-(1, 4) -endoxylanases, {{commonly}} referred to as xylanases, have become integral to the industrial breadmaking process. This enzyme is known to cause improvement in dough rheology, loaf volume, and crumb grain. Significant research has been conducted regarding the structure, function, and inhibition of xylanases, but there is currently no quick and reproducible method to evaluate their effect in baking. The goal of this research was to develop a quantitative method for this purpose and to determine why the effect of xylanases varies with different wheat flours. The currently used methods of <b>test</b> <b>baking,</b> dough stickiness, and spectrophotometric analysis for reducing sugars were evaluated, and failed to provide reproducible results. Therefore, a new method was developed to measure the Flour Water Expression Rate (FWER) with the addition of xylanases. Commercially available enzymes from Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtilis were evaluated in this study. The FWER method measures the amount of water released by the xylanase over a set period of time. This method consistently provided statistically significant data (p< 0. 05), which was able to provide a comparison of xylanases from A. niger and B. subtilis in different flours. The results indicated that the xylanase from A. niger tends to release more water, have a higher FWER value, than the xylanase from B. subtilis. In one flour, A. niger xylanase resulted in an FWER of 15. 18 compared to B. subtilis xylanase that resulted in an FWER of 9. 57 at equivalent activities. However, inhibitors in the wheat appeared to cause an impact on the FWER, which was evaluated with an uninhibited xylanase from B. subtilis. This new method for the evaluation of xylanases in baking suggests varying levels of xylanase inhibitors in wheat may be the reason xylanases effect wheat flours differently...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryJ. M. FaubionThe {{market for}} frozen goods is {{expanding}} and the frozen dough goods sector still has potential {{to expand its}} market. It {{is well known that}} deterioration in bread quality occurs during frozen dough/bread production. In addition, it is known that dough rheology influences bread quality. To prevent deterioration of bread quality, many additives have been used and researched. Combinations of oxidants (potassium bromate and ascorbic acid) are widely used worldwide. However, potassium bromate may be carcinogenic to humans, and it has been detected in bread after baking. Since it has been prohibited or strictly limited in many countries, many researchers have tried to find a replacement. Ascorbic acid is safe for human intake, and does not persist in bread. However, it is not as effective as potassium bromate. Possible replacements in frozen doughs include oxidant (ascorbic acid) -enzyme combinations. This study evaluated the effects of ascorbic acid-specific enzyme combinations as a replacement for the potassium bromate in frozen dough and related the effects to dough behavior (gluten network strength) as evaluated by dynamic oscillation rheometry. Bread quality was evaluated by <b>test</b> <b>baking.</b> Based on the results from fresh baking studies, potassium bromate can be replaced by an optimum level combination of ascorbic acid and hemicellulase/endo-xylanase. This combination clearly improved loaf volume, and crumb grain over both control and potassium bromate containing doughs. For frozen dough/bread production, the addition of all additives improved bread quality, but ascorbic acid and endo-xylanase containing dough resulted in higher volume, and better crumb structure than did dough containing potassium bromate. Dough rheology experiments show that rheology was affected by both the process and additives. Strain sweeps gave the information about dough stability. Both the additives and proofing improved dough stability. Dough behavior (gluten network strength) was assessed by frequency sweeps. Dough containing ascorbic acid and endoxylanase was most stable during frozen dough processing...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} wheat milled to produce flour for leavened bread {{is related to}} its protein content. The {{presence}} of specific proteins in milling wheat gives dough its elastic properties and dertermines baking quality. Good quality wheat will produce loaves with high volumes and a fine crumb texture. It is known that wheat cultivars differ {{in their ability to}} produce good quality bread through differences in the composition of their protein. In cultivars of good quality, the greater the protein content, the better the quality of bread produced. The Manawatu Mills Limited, Palmerston North varies the price it pays for milling wheat according to cultivar and protein content. Premiums can be obtained by increasing grain protein content. This presents local wheat growers with the financial incentive to improve the yield and quality of their crops. To investigate the feasibility of using late applications of nitrogen fertiliser to increase the protein content and yield of milling wheat three trials were carried out at different sites during {{the spring and summer of}} 1989 / 90. These sites were at Kairanga, Almadale and Waituna West in the Manawatu region using the cultivar Rongotea. They were chosen to provide a range of environmental conditions, particularly temperature, over which to test the effect of nitrogen fertiliser on protein content. To achieve different temperature regimes, these sites are situated at low, medium and high altitude. It has been suggested that temperature over the grain-fill period can influence both protein content and composition of wheat, which in turn influences its ability to produce good quality bread. Four different rates of nitrogen fertiliser were applied just prior to the boot stage. These were 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg N/ha. There were significant differences in grain yield amongst sites with Kairanga achieving 6. 4 tonnes/ha, Almadale 5. 9 tonnes/ha and Waituna West 6. 8 tonnes/ha. These yields were above the long term district average. Grain yield responded to late nitrogen at Kairanga and Waituna West. Yields increased from 6. 1 to 6. 9 tonnes/ha at Kairanga and from 6. 4 to 7. 2 tonnes/ha at Waituna West as application rates increased from zero to 80 kg N/ha. Any potential yield response at Almadale was suppressed due to an infection of the root rot fungus, 'take-all'. The yield response at Kairanga resulted from an increase in grain weights whereas at Waituna West it resulted from an increase in ear numbers at harvest. At both responsive sites late nitrogen delayed conopy senescence. Protein contents also varied significantly amongst sites and in response to the application of nitrogen fertiliser. Protein content (14 % moisture basis) ranged from 8. 87 to 10. 87 % at Kairanga, from 10. 35 to 11. 28 % at Waituna West and from 12. 97 to 13. 69 % at Almadale as application rates increased from zero to 80 kg N/ha. The differences in protein levels obtained from different sites resulted in a considerable variation in baking quality. Samples from eight plots from each site were sent to the Wheat Research Institute, Christchurch, for <b>test</b> <b>baking.</b> Average bake scores were 19 at Kairanga, 21 at Waituna West, and 26 at Almadale. There was a strong, positive relationship between bake score and grain protein content amongst these samples. A convenient measure of baking quality, the sodium dodecyl sulphate test, was used to estimate baking quality of each plot. This allowed the relationship between baking quality and grain protein content to be identified for each site. The relationship between protein and baking quality differed between sites, being much stronger at Kairanga than at Almadale and Waituna West. The relatively poor relationship between protein and baking quality at Waituna West and Almadale can be partly explained by the limited range of protein contents resulting from treatment effects, particularly at Almadale. There was evidence that site had influenced the relationship between protein content and baking quality. At Kairanga and Waituna West late applications of nitrogen fertiliser significantly increased both grain yield and protein content. The yield increases, combined with the price premiums for increased protein, meant that it would have been profitable to apply late nitrogen. At Almadale there was no yield response and the protein response was limited, making late applications of nitrogen uneconomic. Pest and disease pressure at Almadale reduced yield, contributing to grain protein content being above the point where premiums are available. It was concluded that it can be economically feasible to use late applications of nitrogen on crops which have a high potential yield. Factors limiting yield, such as pests, diseases and moisture stress, will limit any potential benefit...|$|E

Effects of these enzymes on dough quality, bread weight, height and crumb softness were analysed. Results obtained during commercial-scale <b>baking</b> <b>tests</b> often differed from those obtained during laboratory-scale tests; indicating that results from laboratory-scale <b>baking</b> <b>tests</b> cannot be extrapolated to commercialscale bread production. Low levels of endoxylanase activity benefited bread height and volume without affecting slice brightness in commercial-scale tests.

The results for the optimized <b>baking</b> <b>test</b> in 2007 showed more than 30 % higher loaf volume (713 ml/ 100 g flour) compared with the RMT (544 ml/ 100 g flour).

In addition to that, very good flour quality (> 660 ml/ 100 g flour) started on a relatively low crude protein level of flours > 9, 0 %, but low correlations were obtained for crude protein (%) and gluten (%) for the loaf volume.

Technological effects resulting from the duplication of HMW glutenin subunits Dx 2 and Dy 12 were evaluated using the Alveograph test, the Mixograph <b>test</b> and the <b>baking</b> <b>test.</b> The RR 240 line was shown to have a lower agronomic performance for 1000 -kernel weight and grain yield. However the duplication of the Glu-D 1 allele was associated with a significant effect on dough strength and mixing resistance, and on the Zeleny sedimentation volume. Baking parameters were not significantly modified between both lines although the score values of the CNERNA test were observed to be slightly higher in RR 240 than in Courtot...|$|R
