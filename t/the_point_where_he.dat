5|$|After Crisis Cores release, Kitase {{expressed}} {{surprised at}} {{the quality of the}} cutscenes, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> felt it could almost be a PlayStation 2 game. He also enjoyed the game's ending, surprised by how moving Zack's story became.|$|E
5|$|The {{first house}} on the site was built as a hunting lodge in 1717 for the Duke of Schomberg, a British army {{commander}} of German origin.

5|$|Although he {{immediately}} assumed {{use of his}} stepfather's surname, {{it was not until}} Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.|$|E
60|$|There are {{a number}} of trolley lines in this section of Massachusetts, all {{centring}} in Pittsfield. As the mass of the people were very anxious to see President Roosevelt, the trolleys going to <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> would pass were crowded, and the cars were run with more than usual speed.|$|R

5000|$|General Greene boldly {{pushed down}} towards Camden and Charleston, South Carolina, {{with a view}} to drawing his {{antagonist}} after him to <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was <b>the</b> year before, as well as to driving back Lord Rawdon, whom Cornwallis had left in that field. In his main object—the recovery of the southern states—Greene succeeded by the close of the year, but not without hard fighting and repeated reverses. [...] "We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again," [...] were his words.|$|R
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even took it to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, {{of course he had}} to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{ultimately}} {{crosses the}} line when, in a cocaine-induced rage, {{he gets into}} a confrontation with girlfriend Tracee and beats her to death. She may have been pregnant with his child at the time. This infuriates Tony to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> violates traditional mafia code by striking him repeatedly {{in front of the}} entire family. Bad blood temporarily surfaces between the two but is shortly resolved after Gigi Cestone dies of an aneurysm, thereby forcing Tony to reluctantly promote Ralph to capo.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, {{working in a}} supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much of this period he struggled financially, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed {{at this point in}} his life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid-1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home.|$|E
60|$|Rose {{was lying}} {{back on the}} pillows of a sofa, from which they would not let him get up. He was full of the trip to Holland, and had already pushed Kenby, as Kenby owned, {{beyond the bounds of}} his very general {{knowledge}} of the Dutch language, which Rose had plans for taking up after they were settled in Schevleningen. The boy scoffed at the notion that he was not perfectly well, and he wished to talk with March on <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> had found Kenby wanting.|$|R

5|$|After the Indonesian film {{industry}} crashed in 1992 Umboh directed two television serials: Pahlawan Tak Dikenal (Unknown Hero; 1994) and Apsari. The crash, {{along with his}} long illness, led his finances to destabilise, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lived in government housing. In 1994 Suara Pembaharuan (now Suara Pembaruan), inaccurately reported him having died, a claim which Umboh publicly refuted.

Three weeks before his death, he was reportedly in good health and preparing to film a new serial entitled Gejolak Kampus Muda (Symptoms of a Youth Campus).|$|E

His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> could not get out of bed.

However, the bass parts were done by Daniel Rey and the Dictators' Andy Shernoff. Dee Dee Ramone would only record the additional vocals {{on the album}} citing that {{the other members of}} the band (including himself) were going through personal troubles and changes to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> didn't want to be in the band anymore. After the band finished their Halfway to Sanity tour in February 1989, Dee Dee became sober and left the band.|$|E

Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Pohl's {{tenure as}} fleet {{commander}} was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened him to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{was no longer}} able to carry out his duties.

5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{would not have been able}} to continue racing.|$|E
5|$|Warhol {{subsequently}} {{produced a}} wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans theme is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.|$|E
5|$|When Terra's {{character}} was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found {{him to be}} very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wondered whether he would actually be Zack. However, when considering Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, he thought he may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits.|$|E
50|$|The needle drop is a {{technique}} used in hip hop deejaying. The DJ sets a record spinning, then drops the stylus on the turntable at <b>the</b> exact <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> wants playback to begin without previously cuing up the record. Since {{there is no time}} wasted in cuing, the needle drop allows faster movements by the DJ. The needle drop method was developed in the 1970s by Grand Wizzard Theodore at around the same time that he and Grandmaster Flash were pioneering scratching.|$|R

5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F.

5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able {{to take control of the}} system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
