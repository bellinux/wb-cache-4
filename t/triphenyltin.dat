50|$|<b>Triphenyltin</b> {{chloride}} is an {{organotin compound}} with formula Sn(C6H5)3Cl. It is a colourless solid that dissolves in organic solvents. It slowly reacts with water. The main use for this compound is as a fungicide and antifoulant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triphenyltin</b> {{chloride}} {{has been}} found to cause an increase in post-implantation embryonic loss as well as implantation failure in rats. It also caused detrimental effects on body weight, testicular size and structure, and decreased fertility in Holtzmann rats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Triphenyltin</b> hydride is the organotin {{compound}} with the formula (C6H5)3SnH. It {{is a white}} distillable oil that is soluble in organic solvents. It is often used {{as a source of}} [...] "H·" [...] to generate radicals or cleave carbon-oxygen bonds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triphenyltin</b> {{compounds}} {{have been}} used extensively as algicides and molluscicides in antifouling products since the 1960s, together with tributyltin compounds, and both these classes of compounds are of local (but not global) environmental concern because they are persistent organic pollutants. They are also used in organic synthesis to generate radicals or cleave carbon-oxygen bonds.|$|E

"Tributyltins" [...] {{are used}} as {{industrial}} biocides, e.g. as antifungal agents in textiles and paper, wood pulp and paper mill systems, breweries, and industrial cooling systems. <b>Triphenyltin</b> derivativess {{are used as}} active components of antifungal paints and agricultural fungicides.

5000|$|It was {{believed}} that the only inducer of imposex was tributyltin (TBT), which can be active in extremely low concentrations, but recent studies reported other substances as inducers, such as <b>triphenyltin</b> and ethanol. [...] Tributyltin is an anti-fouling agent for boats which affects females of the species Nucella lapillus (dog whelk), Voluta ebraea (the Hebrew volute), Olivancillaria vesica, Stramonita haemastoma (red-mouthed rock shell) and more than 200 other marine gastropods.|$|E
50|$|Particular {{members of}} the organotin class of {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs), namely tributyltin (TBT) and <b>triphenyltin</b> (TPT) are highly selective and act as very potent agonists of both the retinoid X receptors (RXR α,β, and γ) and PPARγ. This ability to target both receptors at the same time, {{is more effective than}} single receptor activation, as adopogenic signaling can be mediated through both components of the heterodimer complex. This highly effective activation mechanism can pose detrimental, long-term adipogenic effects especially if exposure occurs during development and early life.|$|E
5000|$|Organotins such as {{tributyltin}} (TBT) and <b>triphenyltin</b> (TPT) are endocrine disruptors {{that have}} been shown to increase triglyceride storage in adipocytes. Although they have been widely used in the marine industry since the 1960s, other common sources of human exposure include contaminated seafood and shellfish, fungicides on crops and as antifungal agents used in wood treatments, industrial water systems and textiles. Organotins are also being used in the manufacture of PVC plastics and have been identified in drinking water and food supplies. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a surfactant used for reduction of friction, and it is also used in nonstick cookware. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population. It is a potential endocrine disruptor. [...] Animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to PFOA is linked to obesity when reaching adulthood.|$|E
5000|$|Mothproofing {{chemicals}} - Treatment {{of materials}} as a preventive measure before their use, {{as well as}} simply for storage, has a long history. [...] Arsenical compounds were effective in killing larvae but were considered too toxic for human contact even {{in the early twentieth}} century. <b>Triphenyltin</b> chloride was effective at 0.25%. After 1947, chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides of many varieties were found to be effective at the low concentrations practical for preservative treatment. [...] Examples are chlordane at 2% per weight of wool, toxaphene at 0.8%, pentachlorophenol or BHC at 0.5%, DDT at 0.2%, chlordecone and mirex at 0.06%, and dieldrin at 0.05%. Imidazole (a non-chloronated aromatic heterocyclic) at 1% also gave satisfactory protection. Besides solvent-based applications, insecticidal dusts were commonly used to treat fabrics. In the 1950s EQ-53, a DDT emulsion, was recommended by the US Department of Agriculture to add to the final rinse of washable woolens, but even then cautions were given to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbons on items subject to commercial drycleaning. The 1985 United States EPA ban on most uses of Aldrin and Dieldrin exempted moth-proofing in a closed manufacturing process. Triazole, thiazole, and imidazole derivatives have an anti-feeding effect on Tineola bisselliella larvae when wool is treated with these compounds. At 3% on mass of wool, both epoxiconazole and econazole nitrate protect wool fabric from Tineola bisselliella to the standard specified by Wools of New Zealand Test Method 25 (based on ISO 3998-1977(E).|$|E

Applying the more quantitative plate count and optical density tests on compounds 1 - 3, it was shown that their inhibitory activity ranked in the order 2 > 3 > 1. Significantly, 3 caused around 90 % inhibition of both Eschechia coli (-) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (-) when incubated for 24 h at 37 +/- 1 at the 10. 0 mug/ mL concentration level.
