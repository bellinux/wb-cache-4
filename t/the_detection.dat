40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we study a {{sequential}} type-based <b>detection</b> scheme with <b>the</b> suboptimal <b>detection</b> rule for wireless sensor networks. First, we propose the approximation of <b>the</b> optimal <b>detection</b> rule and derive <b>the</b> suboptimal <b>detection</b> rule. Then we compare {{the performances of}} the optimal and <b>the</b> suboptimal <b>detection</b> rules and show that <b>the</b> approximated <b>detection</b> rule provides <b>the</b> similar results as <b>the</b> optimal <b>detection</b> rule {{in terms of both}} average number of observations and total energy consumption. At the same time <b>the</b> suboptimal <b>detection</b> rule allows <b>the</b> significant reduction of the computational complexity such that <b>the</b> complexity and <b>detection</b> delay per one iteration does not depend on the number of sensor nodes in the network. That makes <b>the</b> proposed approximated <b>detection</b> rule useful for real-time application...|$|R

5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to take}} advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from the explosion of the SN 1987A supernova.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 2013, {{scientists}} at the IAA-CSIC reported <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life.

30|$|Two {{different}} configurations {{for this}} system were submitted. The first one, referred as system 2 a, combines <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> from <b>the</b> Hungarian and Russian phone decoders, since {{they got the}} best performance in the training/development data. The second one, referred as system 2 b, merges <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> from all <b>the</b> phone decoders (i.e., Czech, Hungarian, and Russian) in the final output file.|$|R
30|$|Mangu et al. [101] {{employed}} CNNs, DNNs, and GMMs as acoustic modeling, audio segmentation {{based on}} GMMs and DNNs, word lattices as ASR output, phone-WFST for keyword search, and system combination. System combination took {{the output of}} the different ASR systems and merged <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> of all <b>the</b> systems. <b>Detection</b> scores are normalized by the sum of all the scores of <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> of <b>the</b> given term. Experimental results showed that (1) CNNs perform very well for keyword search, (2) audio segmentation plays a very important role in keyword search, and (3) system combination yields significant performance gains.|$|R

3000|$|Now, we {{describe}} {{in detail the}} proposed channel sensing scheme without quiet period. Various PU signal <b>detection</b> methods, including <b>the</b> energy <b>detection,</b> <b>the</b> cyclostationary feature <b>detection</b> [10], <b>the</b> eigenvalue <b>detection</b> [11], and <b>the</b> correlation matching approach [12], can exploit the proposed scheme. However, for the convenient description of the proposed concept within a limited page length, we only consider <b>the</b> energy <b>detection</b> herein. (For employing energy <b>detection,</b> <b>the</b> noise power should be estimated. There can be several estimation methods.

30|$|The {{theory of}} signal {{detection}} and estimation {{is used in}} a wide variety of target-detection applications. Different formulations for <b>the</b> target <b>detection</b> problem have been suggested depending on the cost of communication. <b>The</b> classical <b>detection</b> theory considered <b>the</b> canonical <b>detection</b> problem in which a decision is made based on observations present in one central location, that is, centralized <b>detection.</b> <b>The</b> classical <b>detection</b> theory suits applications in which the complete observations are available at one location for decision making, for example, <b>detection</b> of <b>the</b> presence of a target using a radar.|$|R

5|$|There {{are various}} neuroimaging {{investigations}} that may detect cerebral sinus thrombosis. Cerebral edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, but for <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> of the thrombus itself, {{the most commonly}} used tests are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} dynamic equilibrium {{and effectively}} carry out certain functions, a system must detect {{and respond to}} perturbations. After <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low.|$|E
40|$|An X-ray {{detector}} has a first detector module, {{a second}} detector module and a manipulation device. The first detector module comprises a first detection region {{lying in a}} first <b>detection</b> plane, and <b>the</b> second detector module comprises a second detection region lying in a second detection plane, which second detection region is adjacent to <b>the</b> first <b>detection</b> region. <b>The</b> manipulation device is designed to align <b>the</b> first <b>detection</b> plane of <b>the</b> first detector module with <b>the</b> second <b>detection</b> plane of <b>the</b> second detector module such that a first surface normal of <b>the</b> first <b>detection</b> plane and a second surface normal of <b>the</b> second <b>detection</b> plane intersect in a reference region...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a control scheme of homodyne <b>detection.</b> To operate <b>the</b> homodyne detector {{as easy as}} possible, a simple Michelson interferometer is used. Here a motivation that the control scheme of <b>the</b> homodyne <b>detection</b> is developed is for our future experiment of extracting the ponderomotively squeezed vacuum fluctuations. To obtain the best signalto- noise ratio using <b>the</b> homodyne <b>detection,</b> <b>the</b> homodyne phase should be optimized. The optimization of the homodyne phase is performed by changing a phase of a local oscillator for <b>the</b> homodyne <b>detection</b> from {{a point at which}} a signal is maximized. In fact, in this experiment, using the developed control scheme, we locked the Michelson interferometer with the homodyne detector and changed the phase of the local oscillator for <b>the</b> homodyne <b>detection.</b> Then, we measured signals quantity changed by changing the phase of the local oscillator for <b>the</b> homodyne <b>detection.</b> Here we used the output from <b>the</b> homodyne <b>detection</b> as <b>the</b> signal...|$|R
