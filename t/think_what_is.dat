It was, as I said, her last wish... <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the {{situation}} of my wife & myself, now deprived of all our children but the youngest & do not expose us to those idle questions, which to a mind in anguish {{is one of the}} severest trials.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{said the}} bill unfairly {{targeted}} the Chinese-American community because it only restricts {{the sale of}} shark fins, which are used almost exclusively in Chinese cuisine. The bill {{does not apply to}} other shark products like oil or meat. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> most insidious about this particular bill is that it sends a very bad message, not only to us in California but {{to the rest of the}} world, that discrimination against Chinese-Americans is OK," [...] Yee said.|$|E
2500|$|Cowell {{was once}} the fastest [...] "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" [...] on BBC's {{motoring}} show Top Gear, driving a Suzuki Liana around the show's test track {{in a time of}} 1:47.1. When Top Gear retired the Liana along with its rankings after the eighth series, Cowell was the eighth fastest overall and the third fastest non-professional driver. On 11 November 2007 Cowell yet again appeared on Top Gear, achieving a time of 1:45.9 thus putting him ahead of chef Gordon Ramsay and back {{at the top of the}} table. His time of 1:45.9 was then tied with English rock singer Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud for the second fastest time, just 0.1 seconds behind Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay. In March 2015, Cowell backed Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson after he was suspended by the BBC for punching a colleague, with Cowell stating on Good Morning Britain: [...] "He's apologised. But I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> quite obvious is that the public are behind him, but you know, that's Jeremy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Goodness—I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> up!" [...] he said, {{and dropped}} {{his head to}} trace {{gradually}} the border between sleeping and waking.|$|R
6000|$|Hal did not reply. He <b>was</b> {{trying to}} <b>think.</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> Ferris' object in telling Hardwick {{he had been}} {{mentioned}} {{in connection with the}} matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Grandfather," [...] exclaimed Laurence, [...] "it {{makes my}} heart throb to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> coming now. We are to see General Washington himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We must <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> to be {{done about}} that,' said Lady Adela. 'Can you tell whether any one from the House has seen you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{answered}} Godwin; [...] "look upon Rosamund, and <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{about to}} befall this city. Can you leave her {{at such a}} time?" ...|$|E
60|$|Very good. Here {{she could}} rest, at any rate, and <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to be done. And first she wrote two letters--one to Mrs. Vimpany {{and one to}} Mr. Mountjoy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. That <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> he says. But, Mrs. Clavering, I care {{nothing for}} that. I care nothing for what any body says or <b>thinks.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> {{it to me}} what they say?" ...|$|R
60|$|And Lord Northmoor {{was thankful}} to {{the tears that}} as usual choked her, while he begged her at present to trust to that last chance. It would <b>be</b> time to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to come next if that failed.|$|R
6000|$|... “Of course,” cried Patsy, {{turning from}} Louise. “We’re {{a lot of}} ninnies. Let us <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best to do and map out a logical program.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us bar all {{the entrances}} to the palace!" [...] said the Scarecrow. [...] "Then {{we shall have}} time to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is fearful," [...] said Mabel, {{unable to}} repress a shiver; [...] "but, Walter, <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> before {{us if we}} stay here! The Saints will guard us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{must put}} the best face upon it," [...] exclaimed that lady; [...] "he was always romantic. But, as he says, or <b>thinks,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the use of friends {{if they do not}} help you in a scrape?" ...|$|R
60|$|Consequently, {{when she}} entered the nursery next morning and found it empty, she did not go into hysterics. She did not even scream. She read Steve's note twice very carefully, then sat down to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> her best plan of action.|$|R
6000|$|RANSOM: [...] "I have <b>been</b> {{trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> the very humblest pie I could eat, {{by way of}} penance; and {{it appears to me}} that I had better begin by saying that I have come to ask her for the money I refused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't know," [...] {{replied the}} panting King. [...] "Let us tie this {{end of the}} beast around a tree. Then we can <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Shallow schoolboys {{certainly}} form {{no part of}} my study, save to kick them down-stairs {{when they}} grow impudent,' said Narcisse, coolly. 'It is only women who <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> long must be grand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you not conceal me here till we {{have time}} to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best to be done?" [...] asked Branwen simply, [...] "for I will die rather than wed this-- this monster Gunrig!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it is a {{very good}} idea, Jerry; I could not <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> up when I got there and did not see anybody. I see you have another fire over the other side. I could make it out clear enough as we came on." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'No,' {{bellowed}} the other. 'No. That was in Wellington, New Zealand. I was bad, and got lower an' lower--couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> up. I {{could hardly}} crawl about. As certain as I'm here, she was poisoning me, {{to get to}} th' other chap--I'm certain of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> {{the matter}} with it,' the duck grumbled to her {{neighbour}} who had called in to pay her a visit. 'Why I could have hatched two broods {{in the time that}} this one has taken!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come in at tea {{time and}} see how I am feeling," [...] she suggested. [...] "I have dad rather on my hands. He has been {{wandering}} about like a lost sheep, the last few afternoons. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--what do you <b>think?</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> it {{probable}} {{that such a}} girl as I would say when such a man as your brother asks her to be his wife? Is he not such a man as a girl would love?" ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{something}} wrong. Grandfather Frog knew it the very minute {{he got up}} that morning. At first he couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it <b>was.</b> He sat with just {{his head out of}} water and blinked his great goggly eyes, as he tried to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it <b>was</b> that was wrong. Suddenly Grandfather Frog realized how still it was. It was a different kind of stillness from anything he could ever remember. He missed something, and he couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it <b>was.</b> It wasn't the song of Mr. Redwing. There were many times when he didn't hear that. It was--Grand-father Frog gave a startled jump out on to the shore. [...] "Chugarum! It's the Laughing Brook! The Laughing Brook has stopped laughing!" [...] cried Grandfather Frog.|$|R

6000|$|... "Since I {{came out}} from the house I have been {{wandering}} about trying to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best to be done, and hoping that something might occur to me which would put me upon the track of the villains who carried Mysa off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear," [...] {{continued}} Beatrice, [...] "you hardly know, perhaps do not <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> Frank's real character.
