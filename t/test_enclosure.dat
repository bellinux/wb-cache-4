50|$|Electrical safety {{testing is}} {{essential}} to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity. Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide. In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on. To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or high potential test), Insulation Resistance Test, Ground (Earth) Bond & Ground Continuity Test & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current <b>Test,</b> <b>Enclosure</b> Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test). These tests are described in IEC 60335, IEC 61010 and many other national and international standards.|$|E

30|$|We {{begin with}} {{a model for the}} late reverberations of {{acoustic}} activities in an acoustic environment (the dense reflections that follow the early reflections). The late reverberations are a result of multiple reflections, arriving at the receiver in random order, with successive reflections being damped based on the arrival time, that is, reflection amplitude is damped to a greater degree if they arrive (at the receiver) later in time. The assumption of randomness is very important {{to the development of a}} statistical model used for reverberation modeling and estimation. It has been demonstrated [36] that when a burst of white noise is radiated into a <b>test</b> <b>enclosure,</b> the phase and amplitudes of the normal modes are random in the instant preceding the cessation of the sound.

40|$|International audienceMany {{numerical}} {{methods for}} computing radiation exchange in enclosures {{are based on}} the computation of direct exchange areas (DEAs) and total exchange areas (TEAs). Excessively long computation times can be associated with TEAs computation. Among the best performing methods, the plating algorithm (PA) computes TEAs from DEAs based on a set of simple recursive equations. An efficient CPU and GPU parallelization of the PA are represented. Nevertheless, PA computation complexity is O(N 3). A novel formulation, the nonrecursive plating algorithm (NRPA), is introduced. It allows the computation of TEAs with a single nonrecursive step. Its equations are formulated by identification to the PA equations giving TEAs from DEAs, requiring one simple assumption. The NRPA is then written in matrix form as mainly a square matrix multiplication operation. Based on advancement in matrix multiplication computation, the NRPA complexity is proven to be O(N 2. 38) for the number of multiplications. CPU and GPU NRPA are implemented based on the optimized linear algebra library BLAS for CPU and cuBLAS for GPU CUDA programs. NRPA is found to highly outperform PA in both CPU and GPU computation times.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of zoos keep their animals in natural-looking enclosures, but it is often unclear {{whether or not the}} species' behavioural and ecological needs are being adequately met. For species that suffer predation in the wild, structural enrichment in captivity can {{play a crucial role in}} connection with enclosure use. Firstly, we examined the effectiveness of structural enrichment in modifying enclosure use in an opportunistic carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). In a <b>test</b> <b>enclosure,</b> we placed both long wooden and cover structures that simulated natural habitat in predetermined sectors. A group of four foxes were exposed to four treatments: (i) structural enrichment in location 1 (LOC 1 s); (ii) structural enrichment in location 2 (LOC 2); (iii) structural enrichment removed (REM); and (iv) structural enrichment again in location 1 (LOC 1 e). Sectors containing long wooden structures were preferred significantly compared to the rest of the enclosure. Sector use was selectively shifted to those in which cover structures were present. Structural enrichment had no significant effect on activity. Secondly, in a new outdoor enclosure, we compared the use of sectors with cover or elongated structures with that of corresponding sectors without structures. All individuals showed a significant preference for sectors containing structures. In the course of the three-week observation period, there was a significant decline in preference for structures and a significant increase in activity (week 1 < week 2 = week 3). These results suggest that in medium-sized carnivores, structural enrichment is beneficial when natural features with a net-like distribution over the habitat are simulated...|$|E

Numerous studies have been performed examining their properties, like what influences the position of their firing fields or what effect changes in the environment have. Most of these studies used reward to motivate the rat, keeping its activity level high, which is important for optimal recordings. In order to record single cell activity male Long Evans rats were implanted with four tetrodes, totalling 16 electrodes, in the CA 1 - region of the hippocampus. Three testing apparatuses were used. The first, a circular one, was used while we were searching for complex spike activity. The next two were square and identical except for the content, one was empty but the rat received a reward during the sessions, the other contained four objects and the rat did not receive a reward. Our aim was to compare the development and stability of the place fields in the presence and absence of reward. Place cell activity was only found {{in two of the}} rats implanted. One of these rats was tested in all three of the enclosures, and manipulations were made to the cues. For the other rat recordings were made in the circular apparatus and in the one containing objects, no cue manipulations were made. We found stable place fields in the presence and absence of reward. The firing fields appeared to be better defined when objects were present than in the empty enclosure where reward was given.

The enclosures and exits permitted normal emigratory and residency behavior. In experiments on the role of emigration in population regulation, the number of resident mice was consistent in enclosures with fixed levels of resources.

We are currently studying particle velocity and charged particle behavior. Lunar and Martian soil simulants (JSC- 1 /JSC Mars- 1) along with standard sand are used in this experiment in order to get the most precise results possible.

40|$|The {{development}} of a ‘Hydrogen Economy’ will see hydrogen fuel cells used in transportation and the generation of power for buildings {{as part of a}} decentralised grid, with low power units used in domestic and commercial environmental, situations. Low power fuel cells will be housed in small protective enclosures, which must be ventilated to prevent a build-up of hydrogen gas, produced during normal fuel cell operation or a supply pipework leak. Hydrogen’s flammable range (4 - 75 %) is a significant safety concern. With poor enclosure ventilation, a low-level leak (below 10 lpm) could quickly create a flammable mixture with potential for an explosion. Mechanical ventilation is effective at managing enclosure hydrogen concentrations, but drains fuel cell power and is vulnerable to failure. In many applications (e. g. low power and remote installation) this is undesirable and reliable passive ventilation systems are preferred. Passive ventilation depends upon buoyancy driven flow, with {{the size and shape of}} ventilation openings critical for producing predictable flows and maintaining low buoyant gas concentrations. Environmentally installed units use louvre vents to protect the fuel cell, but the performance of these vents compared to plain vertical vents is not clear. Comparison small enclosure tests of ‘same opening area’ louvre and plain vents, with leak rates from 1 to 10 lpm, were conducted. A displacement ventilation arrangement was installed on the <b>test</b> <b>enclosure</b> with upper and lower opposing openings. Helium gas was released from a 4 mm nozzle at the base of the enclosure to simulate a hydrogen leak.
