5|$|Ancestry {{information}} {{reported in}} the 2000 Census reflects the diversity of Teaneck residents, with no single country accounting for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> fraction of the population. Residents listed Italian (6.2%), German (6.0%), Russian (5.3%), Irish (5.1%) and Polish (4.2%) as the most common countries of ancestry, and an additional 4.3% listed United States. 6.3% of residents identified themselves as being of West Indian ancestry, of which 3.4% were from Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it was nothing more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> respite not capitalized {{as much as it}} could have been.|$|E
5|$|P. l. maculatus, {{known as}} the Marozi or spotted lion, {{sometimes}} {{is believed to be}} a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that has retained its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of aberrantly coloured individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard-lion hybrid commonly known as a leopon.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> minority {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
5|$|By 6 April 1941, the VVKJ {{had been}} almost {{completely}} mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighter aircraft, and 100 modern medium bombers. Other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of locally made Rogožarski IK-3 fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available. The KJRM consisted of a flotilla of river monitors based on the Danube and a small fleet based in several ports along the Adriatic coast. The blue-water navy centred on a flotilla leader, three smaller destroyers, four obsolescent submarines and a gunboat, supplemented by minelayers and torpedo boats. Some of the smaller vessels in the Yugoslav fleet had been inherited from the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I and were obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the power stations, other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E

25|$|PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, {{the company}} {{responsible}} for {{the distribution of the}} film launched a publicity campaign of half as much as the film's production costs (£850,000) in the UK alone, making the film stand out more as a Hollywood blockbuster rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> European production.|$|R
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E
5|$|Gold and Silver {{were first}} {{publicly}} showcased at the 1997 Nintendo SpaceWorld Expo in Japan, becoming {{the most popular}} exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, Pokémon Yellow, the new titles were announced to be more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> upgrade to Pokémon Red and Blue. Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pokémon. Gold and Silver were designed for the Game Boy Color, allowing them full color support and more detailed sprites. Other additions that were shown included Pokémon breeding, held items, an in-game gadget known as the PokéGear, a real-time internal clock, and backward compatibility with the previous games in the series.|$|E
5|$|Wotton {{station on}} the Alternative Route, which had passed from the {{ownership}} of the Great Central Railway to the London and North Eastern Railway, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the line was abandoned. All buildings of the Brill Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished, other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> building which had once housed the Tramway's forge, which was left derelict. The bridge that had formerly carried the Alternative Route was demolished in 1970, and the former Great Central Railway {{station on the}} Alternative Route was converted to a private house.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana was {{the brainchild}} of Square Enix {{producer}} Masaru Oyamada, who had {{made a name for himself}} within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii, Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series. Instead of a social or card-based game, which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time, Oyamada wanted to create an action role-playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers, something which would worry him throughout its production. The main staff were made up of Oyamada, director Masato Yagi, and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki. Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series. After the initial release of Rise of Mana, Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post-launch content producer Naofumi Takuma. Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board, but Ando would have nothing to do with the project. Development began in July 2012. The game was constructed using the Unity engine. In addition to staff from Square Enix, main development was done by Japanese developer Goshow, and its server security and technical assistance was handled by Fixer. The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist Taiki, while another artist Ryota Murayama handled NPC and monster designs. The game's key art was created by in-house designer Dairaku Masahiko: he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo Isono died in 2013. Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to Isono's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism. The game's title was indicative of the title's nature as a new entry in the Mana series; other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> card-battle mobile game in 2013, Circle of Mana, Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007.|$|E

50|$|The free gas zone is {{a zone of}} freed methane in a hydrate formation, {{beneath the}} hydrate {{stability}} zone. It can influence the rate of methane output at a ridge or ridge region.
