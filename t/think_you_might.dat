2500|$|In October 2015, T.I. {{received}} backlash when he {{was speaking}} on 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: [...] "Not to be sexist but, I can’t vote for {{the leader of the}} free world to be a woman. Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president? It’s kinda like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally – they make very permanent, cemented decisions – and then later, it’s kind of like it didn’t happen, or they didn’t mean for it to happen. And I sure would hate to just set off a nuke. [...] will not be able to negotiate the right kinds of foreign policy; the world ain’t ready yet.

2500|$|For Season 2, Koenig {{teamed up}} with Mark Boal, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, and his {{production}} company, Page 1. Boal had {{conducted a series of}} interviews with Bergdahl as part of a film production he was working on, and both Boal and Bergdahl gave Koenig permission to use those excerpts of those recorded interviews in episodes of Serial. As Koenig stated in Season 2's first episode: [...] "They'd come to us saying 'hey, we've been doing all this reporting on the story, and we've also got this tape. Do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> want to listen?' And yes, we did, and we were kind of blown away, and so we began working with them. They shared their research with us, and also put us in touch with many of their sources... We don't {{have anything to do with}} their movie, but Mark and Page 1 are our partners for Season 2." ...|$|E
2500|$|In just {{a three-year}} career, Lightfoot scored 2,201points, which through the 2010–11 season remain {{the most in}} Big Sky history. In each year, he {{averaged}} 20+ points per game for a career average of 23.1 – nearly four points per game better than the next closest player at Idaho. He was a three-time first team all-conference selection, two-time conference player of the year, and currently holds 13 different records in the Vandals' record book. Among them are the top three single season scoring averages and four of the top six single game scoring marks. His career scoring record is also more than 500points greater than the second closest player in school history. When asked if this mark will ever be topped, he responded, [...] "I think it will happen, as all records are made to be broken. I do not know when or how, but I think Rodney Stuckey was on pace to break it if he had stayed four years at [...] It {{will have to be}} a young kid who stays all four years. However, if you are scoring 20 points per game as a sophomore, then I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> leave early and go to the [...] (NBA)." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his second}} term as {{chairman}} of the Commission on Fine Arts, Walton oversaw the approval of I. M. Pei's design for the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art and the restoration of the Renwick Gallery. He dissented from the commission's approval of Pei's building, but Pei also implemented many of Walton's critiques. Although Walton voted to approve both buildings, he strongly disliked the design of the J. Edgar Hoover Building and had serious concerns about the initial designs for Gyo Obata's National Air and Space Museum. He also played a critical if minor role {{in the design of the}} Washington Metro. The CFA repeatedly criticized the designs of architect Harry Weese, who had been hired to design the city's new subway stations. Numerous meetings were held in which Weese's designs were found to fall short. In January 1968, Walton presided at yet another meeting between the CFA and Weese. At this meeting, Weese appeared unable to respond to or understand any of the commission's comments or suggestions. An exasperated Gordon Bunshaft rose, and—in front of a shocked Weese—began sketching out on a large easel what came to be the Brutalist design for Washington's Metro stations. As the meeting broke up, with the design appearing to have won over the CFA, Walton quipped, [...] "Well Gordon, since you've designed the subway so far, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> as well continue with the project!" [...] Although Weese is credited with the design of the Washington Metro stations, it was Walton's support that led the CFA to approve the design outlined by Bunshaft.|$|E

6000|$|He {{drew a deep}} breath. She started forward {{where she}} sat, and looked past him at the door, as if {{to see whether the}} way of escape was clear.
