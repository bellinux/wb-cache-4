50|$|Section 6 of the ISDA Master Agreement {{contains}} the provisions which enable {{a party to}} terminate transactions early if an Event of Default or <b>Termination</b> <b>Event</b> occurs in respect of the other party and set out the procedure to calculate and net the termination values of those transactions to produce a single amount payable between the parties.|$|E
50|$|The Master Agreement {{provides}} the parties two {{means by which}} the Master Agreement and all transactions thereunder may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events. The first is the occurrence of an event of default, which permits a party to terminate the Master Agreement and liquidate all transactions if the other party is affected by an Event of Default. In contrast, Termination Events may affect both parties, are usually the result of the actions of third parties, and may provide the affected party a grace period to cure the <b>Termination</b> <b>Event</b> before the other party may terminate and liquidate the Master Agreement.|$|E

A strain, in which three origins were inactivated, confirmed that the distribution of <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> is primarily dictated by the stochastic activation time of origins.

The celebrated model of Rubinstein (1982) has provided a formal justification for equitable payoff division. A typical assumption of these models under risk is that the <b>termination</b> <b>event</b> means a complete and irrevocable breakdown in negotiations. In this paper, the meaning of termination is reinterpreted as the imposition to finish negotiations immediately. Specifically, bargaining terminates when the last offer becomes definitive. While Rubinstein’s model predicts an immediate agreement with stationary strategies, we show that the same payoff allocation is attainable under non-stationary strategies. Moreover, the payoffs in delayed equilibria are potentially better for the proposer than those in which agreement is immediately reached...|$|E

We also demonstrate that a poly-dT stretch downstream of CSB II has a modest stimulatory effect on the termination efficiency.

In this model, {{the existence of the}} transition pathway from the terminator to the promoter increases the rate of ribosomal RNA precursor synthesis. In addition to this 'non-transcribed spacer' traverse of RNA polymerase I, the co-ordination of initiation and termination allows a rapid on/off switch transition from the minimum to the maximum rate of ribosomal RNA precursor synthesis. Furthermore, taking account of the participation of two factors in the <b>termination</b> <b>event,</b> we propose a plausible molecular mechanism for the co-ordination of initiation and termination.

40|$|The mu and delta {{immunoglobulin}} heavy-chain genes {{comprise a}} complex transcriptional unit {{in which a}} single mRNA precursor gives rise to mu- and delta-specific transcripts. During the immature B-cell stage, posttranscriptional processing events involving alternate splicing and cleavage-polyadenylation site selection give rise to mu- but not delta-encoding transcripts. In terminally differentiated B cells, delta mRNA is not synthesized because of a transcription <b>termination</b> <b>event</b> occurring upstream of the delta-gene locus. In an attempt to gain insight into the respective contributions of alternate splicing and cleavage-polyadenylation in the control of delta mRNA synthesis, we have constructed a set of plasmids in which membrane mu (mu m) -delta intergenic sequences containing the mu m poly(A) site but differing in splicing capacity were inserted in between a VH and delta gene. The mu m-delta insertion vectors were transfected into a B lymphoma line representative of an immature stage, and proximal mu m poly(A) site usage and delta mRNA synthesis were assessed. To determine unequivocally whether the mu m-delta intergenic region can regulate termination, the insertion vectors were also transfected into a B myeloma line, and transcription through the region was measured. In immature B-cell transfectants, splicing site selection {{was found to have}} a key role in determining poly(A) site utilization and concomitant delta mRNA expression. Mature delta mRNA synthesis was blocked by an upstream cleavage-polyadenylation event only when the proximal poly(A) site was associated with appropriate splicing signals. Furthermore, in vitro transcription assays revealed that the mu m-delta intergenic region is sufficient to regulate transcription termination within a 1, 2430 -base-pair region containing the mu m poly(A) site in myeloma transfectants. The mu m-delta insertion vectors provide an excellent model system for studying the regulatory aspects of this transcription <b>termination</b> <b>event...</b>|$|E
30|$|There {{are other}} classes of {{bursting}} dynamics {{in which the}} active phase of the burst terminates in a fold of limit cycles, but in which the initiation event is different from those considered here.

For these, the active phase of the burst initiates with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. However, since the <b>termination</b> <b>event</b> is also a fold of limit cycles, we hypothesize that these bursters will also exhibit torus canards. We note that, for these super-Hopf/fold cycle bursters, the slow passage effect through a Hopf bifurcation will {{play a role in}} determining the system parameters for which torus canards exist, just as it did for the sub-Hopf/fold cycle bursters.|$|E
40|$|Drought {{termination}} can {{be associated}} with dramatic transitions from drought to flooding. Greater attention may be given to these newsworthy and memorable <b>events,</b> but drought <b>terminations</b> that proceed gradually also pose challenges for water resource managers. This paper defines drought termination as a distinctive phase of the event. Using observed river flow records for 52 UK catchments, a more systematic and objective approach for detecting drought terminations is demonstrated. The parameters of the approach are informed by a sensitivity analysis that ensures a focus on terminations of multi-season to multi-year droughts. The resulting inventory of 467 drought terminations provides an unprecedented historical perspective on this phenomenon in the UK. Nationally and regionally coherent drought <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> are identifiable, although their characteristics vary both between and within major episodes. Contrasting drought <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> in 1995 – 1998 and 2009 – 2012 are examined in greater depth. The data are also used to assess potential linkages between metrics of drought termination and catchment properties. The duration of drought termination is moderately negatively correlated with elevation (r s [*]=[*] − 0. 47) and catchment average rainfall (r s [*]=[*] − 0. 42), suggesting that wetter catchments in upland areas of the UK tend to experience shorter drought terminations. More urbanized catchments tend to have gradual drought terminations (contrary to expectations of flashy hydrological response in such areas), although this may also reflect the type of catchments typical of lowland England. Significant correlations are found between the duration of the drought development phase and both the duration (r s [*]=[*] − 0. 29) and rate (r s [*]=[*]  0. 28) of drought termination. This suggests that prolonged drought development phases tend to be followed by shorter and more abrupt drought terminations. The inventory helps to place individual events within a long-term context. The drought termination phase in 2009 – 2012 was, at the time, regarded as exceptional in terms of magnitude and spatial footprint, but the Thames river flow record identifies several comparable events before 1930.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of reversible addition-fragmentation {{chain transfer}} (RAFT), R-group approach star polymerizations {{have been studied}} via a combined experimental and theoretical approach. From the improved understanding herein developed, design criteria have been suggested to aid in future syntheses of RAFT, R-group approach star polymer. The suggested criteria are as follows. To minimize the quantity of linear polymer in the system, {{it is important to}} have a high rate of monomer propagation but a small delivery of radicals to the system. Crucial to the prevention of star-star coupling and resulting molecular weight distribution (MWD) broadening is the minimization of radical <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> between star molecules. Noting that the number of <b>termination</b> <b>events</b> is directly correlated to the number of decomposed initiator molecules, this might be achieved via several methods. A slow rate of initiator decomposition, a fast rate of propagation, or use of a rate-retarding RAFT agent can all lead to a reduction in star-star coupling events. Additionally, simulations reported herein demonstrate that the use of a star-forming RAFT agent substrate which has a fewer number of arms will lead to a reduction in the concentration of star-star coupled products. Ab initio calculations have been used to study intramolecular RAFT equilibria occurring early in the preequilibrium. These calculations have shown that highly stable intramolecular adduct radicals might be formed due to the close proximity of radicals and S=C bonds. The effect of these on the kinetics is studied. © 2006 American Chemical Society...|$|R

This model has been re-examined here and evidence is presented which demonstrates that ribosomes containing the C 1054 delta mutation enhance the activity of suppressors of both UAG and UAA termination codons introduced into the host.

40|$|Translation {{termination}} at premature termination codons (PTCs) triggers {{degradation of}} the aberrant mRNA, but the mechanism by which a <b>termination</b> <b>event</b> is defined as premature is still unclear. Here we show that the physical distance between the termination codon and the poly(A) -binding protein PABPC 1 is a crucial determinant for PTC recognition in human cells. "Normal" termination codons can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) when this distance is extended; and vice versa, NMD can be suppressed by folding the poly(A) tail into proximity of a PTC or by tethering of PABPC 1 nearby a PTC, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function of PABPC 1 in promoting correct translation termination and antagonizing activation of NMD. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that spatial rearrangements of the 3 ' untranslated region can modulate the NMD pathway and thereby provide a novel mechanism for posttranscriptional gene regulation...|$|E

Termination in vivo occurs within the first element. This site is preferentially used in vitro at low template concentrations.
