He created the visual concept for televised town hall meetings for <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> Peter Jennings. He also directed the historic town hall meetings that aired during the week-long series Nightline in South Africa and Nightline in the Holy Land, the critically acclaimed series examining Arab-Israeli conflicts; and the four-hour Nightline on AIDS, at the time, the most comprehensive coverage of the epidemic ever shown on network television.

She later reported on South African politics for Sunday Tribune (where she was also deputy bureau chief), Business Day (where she was also deputy news editor), Financial Mail (where she was associate editor) and Finance Week (where she was assistant editor). Smith {{has worked as a}} producer for ABC's Nightline (US) with <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> for CBS 60 Minutes. She has helped produce television documentaries for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for many years, including two award winning documentaries on Nelson Mandela. A documentary on AIDS for the United Nations won the Prix Italia in 2006. She had a long career as a feature writer for the Los Angeles Times. She has written for Washington Post, The Observer, Guardian, Le Monde, Brain World, Microbicide Quarterly, Boston Globe and other publications.

500|$|A {{media circus}} ensued, with Smith being interviewed by <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> Johnny Carson, among others, <b>and</b> with nightly <b>reports</b> {{by the major}} American networks. On July 7, 1983, she flew to Moscow with her parents, and spent two weeks as Andropov's guest. During the trip she visited Moscow and Leningrad and spent time in Artek, the main Soviet pioneer camp, {{in the town of}} Gurzuf on the Crimean Peninsula. Smith wrote in her book that in Leningrad she and her parents were amazed by the {{friendliness}} of the people and by the presents many people made for them. Speaking at a Moscow press conference, she declared that the Russians were [...] "just like us". In Artek, Smith chose to stay with the Soviet children rather than accept the privileged accommodations offered to her. For ease of communication, teachers and children who spoke fluent English were chosen to stay in the building where she was lodged. Smith shared a dormitory with nine other girls, and spent her time there swimming, talking and learning Russian songs and dances. While there, she made many friends, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, a fluent English speaker.|$|R
50|$|Rohde's capture was not {{initially}} admitted by the Bosnian Serb authorities, who gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} he had been detained and where he was being held. Five days after he was taken prisoner, the Bosnian Serb news agency issued a statement on his capture. The US Government subsequently brought to bear intense diplomatic pressure to release him. A key role was played by Kati Marton, an author and journalist married to the US envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was negotiating with the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević to end the Bosnian War. Marton, who was at the time the chairwoman of the Committee to Protect Journalists, intervened repeatedly during the talks that led to the Dayton Agreement to persuade Milošević to use his influence to secure Rohde's release. The US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was also involved in pressing for Rohde's release at the Dayton talks. A variety of other political and journalistic figures were also involved in campaigning on Rohde's behalf, including Senator Bob Dole, Peter Jennings, <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> <b>and</b> David Frost. Rohde was subsequently pardoned by order of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić in what Karadžić characterized as a goodwill gesture.|$|R

40|$|Cartoon series such as “The Simpsons” and “South Park” have {{improved}} significantly {{through the use}} of computerised animation and enhancement. This has been most evident in the speed of production and the realism of the representation of character portrayal and settings, but has also intensified the impact of the modal and compositional functions of meaning - making in TV cartoons. In the first episode of “South Park” Trey Parker and Matt Stone used construction paper and stop - motion animation, requiring months to produce a somewhat simple - minded story with schematic characterisation, limited facial movement, no crowd scenes and shadows of crepe paper models frequently obtrusive. The quirky characters, both children and adults, the strong sense of community and the self-referentiality of the narrative, which have become trade - marks of the series, were all there in embryo, however. By the time of the episode ”Free Hat” in Season 6 digital techniques had not only speeded up the production process, but had led to richer characterisation, realistic facial expression, authentic speech – except where cartoon schematics were preserved for humour [...] , individuality within crowd scenes and graded colour and shading. Most pointedly, it allowed the realistic depiction of recognisable public figures like the talk - show host <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> the film directors George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Frances Ford Coppola, who are attacked by the children of South Park for digitally remastering their best - known films, thereby losing, purportedly, their artistic integrity. In addition to lampooning (verbally, visually and musically) these directors for succumbing to the “Fascist” efficiency of computer animation, Parker and Stone (by now regularly using advanced CGI techniques themselves) represent themselves in a live action insert as “humane” in their remastered version of Episode 1 of “South Park”. As always with this series, intertextuality, parody and self-referentiality serve a modal function, bonding viewers with the absurd but honest politics of the child protagonists. Play with sub - frames and destruction of the space between screen and audience exploits the compositional potential of the digitalised audio - visual medium and enriches with purely visual jokes the humour of the story-line...|$|R
40|$|Metal-free chiral Brønsted acid {{catalysis}} {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} new class of chiral organic catalysis. Several quite nice chiral Brønsted acids, such as urea/thiourea, alcohol, and phosphoric acid, have already been reported as a chiral electron acceptor of carbonyl and imine compounds. 1 However, compared with chiral metal Lewis acid catalysts, the utility of chiral Brønsted acid catalysts is still limited to the reactive substrates. This drawback can be overcome by designing a Brønsted acid catalyst with higher acidity. To increase the acidity of Brønsted acids, it is necessary to increase the stability of the counteranion. <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> co-workers <b>reported</b> that introduction of a strong electron acceptor group, such as d NTf, into an acid system instead of an dO group increased the stability of counteranions and their acidity (Figure 1). 2 For example, the pKa of N-triflyl benzamide in acetonitrile (11. 06) is much lower than that of benzoic acid (20. 7).

5000|$|Over the decades, Neuman has {{frequently}} been referenced in outside media, {{and his face}} has often appeared in political cartoons as a shorthand for unquestioning stupidity. During the administration of United States President George W. Bush, Neumans features were frequently merged with those of Bush by editorial cartoonists such as Mike Luckovich and Tom Tomorrow. The image has also appeared on magazine covers, notably The Nation. A large Bush/Neuman poster {{was part of the}} Washington protests that accompanied Bushs 2001 inauguration. The alleged resemblance between the two has been noted more than once by Hillary Clinton. On July 10, 2005, speaking at the Aspen Institutes Ideas Festival, she said, [...] "I sometimes feel that Alfred E. Neuman is in charge in Washington," [...] referring to Bushs purported [...] "What, me worry?" [...] attitude. At the October 2008 Alfred E.
