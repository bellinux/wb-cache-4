50|$|Navitaire {{was founded}} as PRA Solutions in 1993 by Accenture. As PRA Solutions, Navitaire {{initially}} provided airline revenue accounting software and revenue protection software for airlines. The company then moved into developing a direct-distribution platform to book airline reservations through a solution called via World Network, {{an alternative to}} the global distribution system traditionally used by travel agents to sell airline flights. In 2000, PRA Solutions purchased <b>the</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> reservation system from Hewlett Packard. The following year, in 2001, PRA Solutions changed its name to Navitaire. Navitaire continued to invest in <b>the</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> platform to add new capabilities. For example, in 2002, Navitaire implemented codeshare technology for Virgin Blue, and the company later introduced multi-city bookings at the request of Jetstar. Following Hewlett Packard's announcement in 2001 of its plans to discontinue support for the HP3000 hardware that <b>the</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Skies</b> system operated on, Navitaire began developing its replacement reservation system called New Skies. The company began converting clients to the new system in 2005.|$|R
