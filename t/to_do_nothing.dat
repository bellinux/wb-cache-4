5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
25|$|Articulating {{solutions}} to {{the tragedy of the}} commons {{is one of the main}} problems of political philosophy. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b> When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.|$|E

25|$|According to legend, Gable was lent to Columbia Pictures, then {{considered}} a second-rate operation, {{as punishment for}} refusing roles; however, this has been refuted by more recent biographies. MGM {{did not have a}} project ready for Gable and was paying him $2,000 per week, under his contract, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b> Studio head Louis B. Mayer lent him to Columbia for $2,500 per week, making a $500 per week profit.|$|E
25|$|For Hitchcock, the actors, {{like the}} props, {{were part of}} the film's setting, as he said to Truffaut:In my opinion, the chief {{requisite}} for an actor is the ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be utilised and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.|$|E

Grant, Sherman, and Thomas planned a {{flanking}} attack on Bragg's force, with an assault by Sherman against {{the northern end of}} Missionary Ridge, supplemented by two of Thomas' divisions from the center. Hooker, instead of attempting to capture Lookout Mountain and then move across the Chattanooga Valley to the break in the ridge at Rossville, Georgia, was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> besides forwarding troops toward the center.|$|E

In such case, nothing discriminatory can be done, but everything must be implemented by due legal process. Compensation for the investment holder that is expropriated or nationalized should be both adequate and effective, and made in advance, {{based on the}} real investment value determined {{at the time the}} decision is publicly announced by the proper authorities. This payment will be updated until actual payment, and the affected investor will receive interest.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that if she was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
25|$|A {{utilitarian}} view {{asserts that}} it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all). An alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already {{in place in the}} situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.|$|E

25|$|When Pessoa {{explained}} {{his version of}} events of the Macau incident to Hasegawa and suggested to forward the affidavit to Ieyasu (who was retired, but still in charge), Hasegawa advised Pessoa <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> of the sort. Hasegawa explained that while Ieyasu was mindful of the truculent behaviours of the Japanese abroad, he {{would be forced to}} take his countrymen's side as a matter of principle if the matter was brought up officially. Pessoa was not fully convinced by this argument, and drew up an unofficial memorandum of the Portuguese case for Honda Masazumi, Ieyasu's handler of foreign affairs, much to the displeasure of Hasegawa and Murayama, who wrongly suspected that Pessoa had also complained about the two in the memorandum. In any case, Honda, with authorization from Ieyasu, gave Pessoa's envoy written assurances that Japanese sailors would be forbidden to travel to Macau, and any who did could be handled according to Portuguese laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} polio workers seen the {{previous}} year continued in 2013. Seven clinic workers whose duties included vaccination were killed in Swabi, Pakistan on New Year's Day. The Pakistani government began providing police and paramilitary protection to a renewed vaccination campaign, but amid worries that this would inspire hostility, some escorts have been refused. Both escorting officers and polio workers continue to be killed in Pakistan, where vaccination has been said to violate Islamic law. In February a pair of similar attacks in Nigeria killed nine female polio vaccinators following a local cleric's condemnation of vaccination. The security situation in Afghanistan improved in May when the Afghani Taliban announced it would support polio eradication, pledging <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to hinder the campaign as long as no foreigners {{were involved in the}} vaccinations. In December 2013, three polio workers were killed in northwest Pakistan and three more were killed in Karachi in January 2014.|$|E
25|$|By early 1798, the United Irish {{membership}} on {{the ground}} (by now 280,000 sworn members) was under severe pressure, suffering from the terror of a roving campaign of disarmament while under instructions <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> until the arrival of French aid. In March 1798, {{the bulk of the}} leadership was arrested and preemptive risings had already broken out in Tipperary but indecision still divided the rump leadership. Finally, the unrelenting pressure led the militant faction of the United Irishmen to set the date for a general uprising on 23 May without French aid. However, information from the informers Thomas Reynolds and Francis Magan led to the arrests of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Samuel Neilson shortly before the rising but more crucially foiled the planned rising in Dublin which was to be the central core of the planned rebellion. On the 5 June, Sir Edward Crosbie of Carlow became the first United Irishman to be executed for treason.|$|E

50|$|A minor {{but often}} {{confusing}} point is as follows: most conserved quantum numbers are additive, so in an elementary particle reaction, {{the sum of}} the quantum numbers should be the same before and after the reaction. However, some, usually called a parity, are multiplicative; i.e., their product is conserved. All multiplicative quantum numbers belong to a symmetry (like parity) in which applying the symmetry transformation twice is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>nothing</b> (involution).|$|R
25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> at all.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{reaches the}} hotel where Clementine is captive where he comes {{face to face with}} her captor, who reveals that he was the owner of the station wagon that the group ransacked after leaving the dairy and lost his family to walkers as a result. Seeking revenge, the {{stranger}} found Clementine on his walkie-talkie and manipulated her into keeping tabs on the group under the guise that he had her parents and had been following them ever since. Realizing that the man is insane, Lee, with Clementine's help, kills him. As Lee and Clementine leave the hotel, Clementine spots her parents, both of whom have turned into walkers, and Lee falls unconscious. Awakening soon after, he realizes he is near conversion, and instructs her to escape the city and meet Omid and Christa at the edge of town. The player can choose to have Lee order Clementine to either kill him or leave him to become a walker, or can opt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing,</b> in which case Clementine will choose based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999, Chrétien {{supported}} Canada's involvement in NATO's bombing campaign of Yugoslavia {{over the issue of}} Kosovo, even through the operation was unsanctioned by the UN Security Council thanks to a Russian veto of an Anglo-American resolution asking for the Security Council's approval of the NATO bombing. The idea of bombing Yugoslavia caused some discomfort within the ranks of the Liberal party as the NATO campaign effectively meant supporting Kosovo separatists against a government determined to prevent Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia. Chrétien was personally uncomfortable with the idea of bombing Yugoslavia, but supported the war because he valued good relations with the United States far more than he cared about Yugoslavia. Chrétien's foreign minister at the time, Lloyd Axworthy justified Canada's involvement in NATO bombing of Yugoslavia under the grounds that allegations of massacres against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo made the use of force legitimate on humanitarian grounds, even without the approval of the UN Security Council. Likewise, Chrétien was later to tell Lawrence Martin that it was far better to intervene {{in the internal affairs of}} Yugoslavia to stop human rights violations in the Kosovo region by Serbian forces than <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{providing}} help in regaining his throne, the Dutch brought Amangkurat II {{under their}} tight control. Amangkurat II was apparently {{unhappy with the}} situation, especially the increasing Dutch control of the coast, but he was helpless {{in the face of}} a crippling financial debt and the threat of Dutch military power. The king engaged in a series of intrigues to try to weaken the Dutch position without confronting them head on; for example, by trying to co-operate with other kingdoms such as Cirebon and Johor and the court sheltered people wanted by the Dutch for attacking colonial offices or disrupting shipping such as Untung Surapati. In 1685, Batavia sent Captain Tack, the officer who captured Trunojoyo, to capture Surapati and negotiate further details into the agreement between VOC and Amangkurat II but the king arranged a ruse in which he pretended to help Tack. Tack was killed when pursuing Surapati in Kartasura, then capital of Mataram (present day Kartasura near Solo), but Batavia decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> since the situation in Batavia itself was far from stable, such as the insurrection of Captain Jonker, native commander of Ambonese settlement in Batavia, in 1689. Mainly due to this incident, by the end of his reign, Amangkurat II was deeply distrusted by the Dutch, but Batavia were similarly uninterested in provoking another costly war on Java.|$|E
