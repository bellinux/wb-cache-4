Kiss me, Ruth; you have made me the happiest woman in the world, and I would give a great deal to be able to set this right without your having to put yourself forward in it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I feel {{sure you}} will all be sorry, and that though I am not your son you would go on {{treating}} me as if I were a younger brother of Rupert's. But I could not bear it, father. I could not accept anything from you, for I should feel {{that it was the}} result of this wicked fraud, that it was what this woman, I cannot call her mother, had schemed for me to get. Some day when I have made my way, and when all this may not hurt me so horribly as it seems to do now, I will come and see you all if you will let me, <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> for the love and kindness that should never have been mine.

5000|$|Soulseek {{is entirely}} financed by donations, with no {{advertising}} or user fees. Nir Arbel writes, as of July 1, 2008: I {{would also like}} to take this opportunity to address some of the lies that have been spread about our lifestyle and the money we make off Soulseek. We live from hand to mouth. A few months ago we had to let go of sierracat, our system admin, despite his excellent work, because we could no longer afford his services. We are pretty heavily in debt. We are fighting a legal battle in France. We are not poor nor starving, but neither of us drives a fancy car nor could we begin to afford one if we wanted to. I don't like discussing money issues, but I feel it necessary to defend ourselves from accusations that are, and have always been, patently untrue. With that, I would like <b>to</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> for using Soulseek and making it a significant, if not hugely popular or successful, experience. Thanks.|$|E
