40|$|A {{demonstration}} compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) bus has been operating on The University of Texas at Austin shuttle system since 1992. This CNG vehicle, provided by the Blue Bird Company, was {{an opportunity for the}} University {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a CNG bus for shuttle operations.

40|$|Odorants {{activate}} sensory transduction in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) via a cAMP-signaling cascade, {{which results}} in the opening of nonselective, cyclic nucleotide–gated (<b>CNG)</b> channels. <b>The</b> consequent Ca 2 + influx through CNG channels activates Cl channels, which serve to amplify the transduction signal. We investigate here some general properties of this Ca-activated Cl channel in rat, {{as well as its}} functional interplay with <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> channel, by using inside-out membrane patches excised from ORN dendritic knobs/cilia. At physiological concentrations of external divalent cations, the maximally activated Cl current was ∼ 30 times as large as <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> current. <b>The</b> Cl channels on an excised patch could be activated by Ca 2 + flux through <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> channels opened by cAMP. The magnitude of the Cl current depended on the strength of Ca buffering in the bath solution, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> and Cl channels were probably not organized as constituents of a local transducisome complex. Likewise, Cl channels and the Na/Ca exchanger, which extrudes Ca 2 +, appear to be spatially segregated. Based on the theory of buffered Ca 2 + diffusion, we determined the Ca 2 + diffusion coefficient and calculated that <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> and Cl channel densities on the membrane were ∼ 8 and 62 μm− 2, respectively.

40|$|In recent years, {{domestic}} {{natural gas}} production has increased markedly, {{and now has}} the potential to become a cleaner and less expensive energy source than diesel fuel for use in the public transportation sector. Also, in the face of increasing diesel fuel costs and increasing concerns regarding air emissions caused by its fleet, Lafayette CityBus Corporation is examining long-term fuel alternatives to maintain its current level of services. ^ This study uses benefit-cost analysis to compare the total cost of three potential options for bus replacement. The candidate systems are standard diesel, hybrid diesel-electric and compressed natural gas (<b>CNG).</b> In addition, <b>the</b> environmental costs of these three fleet options are estimated. ^ There are two main components of total cost: operating cost and capital cost. This study analyzes and compares the costs among the three candidate systems over a 15 -year project horizon. Results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> option has <b>the</b> lowest net present value (NPV) of total cost, and that cost savings would be larger if the corporation could obtain a grant for <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> fueling station or if the project lifespan could expand to 20 years. <b>The</b> <b>CNG</b> option would produce the least amount of emissions and largest environmental benefit. ^ Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the inherent riskiness of the three fleet options. CNG is always lower cost than hybrid diesel-electric. Depending on assumptions regarding the underlying price distributions, <b>the</b> <b>CNG</b> option has a 51 to 79 percent chance of being lower cost than the standard diesel option.
