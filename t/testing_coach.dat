40|$|High-stakes {{testing has}} {{increased}} since {{the passage of}} the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001. Many teachers are using teacher-centered activities with memorization and <b>testing</b> <b>coach</b> books instead of creating student-centered higher-order thinking activities. Some school districts are eliminating subjects that are not tested on state assessments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to collect information regarding the teaching experiences of 9 elementary teachers from the same school within one public school district. Teacher interviews were utilized in this case study to explore the perceived effects of high-stakes tests on elementary curriculum and instruction. The theoretical foundation for this study was based on the theories of behaviorism and constructivism. The study research questions addressed teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the effects of high-stakes testing on curriculum and instruction. Qualitative coding was used to identify patterns and themes in the data through the systematic analysis and constant comparison of data sets. Data from interview transcripts were analyzed to determine factors, events, conditions, personal perspectives, and concerns of the elementary teachers. Teachers felt that high-stakes testing has resulted in a rigid, unbalanced and narrow curriculum. Teachers described that high-stakes testing has resulted in clear expectations for teachers which have helped them to know exactly what they have to teach within their classrooms. Implications for positive social change include providing teachers with necessary professional development relating to the effects of high-stakes testing; this can lead to curricular and instructional change that provides more instruction in higher-order thinking...|$|E

40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} (RSW) had been {{widely used in}} {{automotive}} industry; because of their advantages easily to process and low cost, high speed and high production, suitability for automation. About 2000 - 7000 spot welds were used in joining modern vehicles. This project deals with the investigation of failure mode and mechanical properties of weld joint of low galvanized steel and stainless Steel. The main objective of this project is strength investigation using RSW of low carbon steel and stainless steel. For design of experiment, Taguchi method was employed by using Minitab software, and total nine sets experiment with 3 type of parameter (current, squeeze time, pressure) were conducted. The studies of mechanical properties, are consists of various tests; Tensile <b>test,</b> <b>Coach</b> Peel <b>test,</b> Hardness test, microstructure to analyze and investigate the weldability of galvanized Steel and stainless Steel sheet. Visual inspection was done to determine the failure mode of the spot welding. As a result, tensile test have larger strength variation than the coach-peel test. Wider width and depth of weld nugget affect the weldability of the welding. Different parameters were obtained for optimum parameter for tensile <b>test</b> and <b>coach</b> peel <b>test</b> by using Taguchi method.

Melbourne would prove to be his final test in the Green and Gold, Lewis being one of four players dropped from the side after the 8-24 loss to the Kiwis (second row forward Bob Lindner, voted as the player of the Kangaroo Tour, also missed the final two tests after breaking his leg at Olympic Park).|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{confirm the}} effect of maturational {{differences}} on anthropometric and physical testing and explore {{the effect of}} maturation on technical skill and coaches’ perceptions of skill in adolescent Australian footballers. Methods: Athletes were recruited from a semi-elite under 16 competition (n = 94, age 15. 7 ± 0. 3 years) and completed anthropometric, physical, and technical skill <b>tests.</b> <b>Coaches</b> from each team provided subjective ratings of athletes’ technical skills. Maturation groups were derived from years from peak height velocity estimates, with classifications either later, average or earlier maturing. Results: Effect size comparisons revealed very large to moderate effects between groups for anthropometric measures and performance in sprint and jump tasks. Small to moderate effects were reported between groups for coaches’ perceptions of skill, with the earlier maturing group perceived to have better overall technical skills, marking and ball winning abilities. Small to trivial effects were reported for performance in the technical skill tests. Conclusions: Despite no differences in skill tests, earlier maturing athletes may be afforded significant selection and competition advantages due to advanced physical capacities and coaches’ perceptions of skill...|$|R
