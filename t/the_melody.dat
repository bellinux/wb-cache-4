5|$|<b>The</b> <b>melody</b> of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within <b>the</b> <b>melody</b> {{is similar to the}} patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed <b>the</b> <b>melody.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bach used {{a rather}} unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he based his later chorale cantata on this hymn on <b>the</b> <b>melody</b> by Jacob Regnart. The hymn {{is treated as}} in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between the verses.|$|E
5|$|His choral {{compositions}} feature rich harmony, vocal polyphony, and imitation. His earlier choral {{arrangements of}} folk songs were primarily strophic arrangements of <b>the</b> <b>melody.</b> As the composer gained more experience, {{the structure of}} his choral compositions and arrangements of folk songs became more frequently intertwined with text.|$|E

25|$|According to Sephardic tradition, the Baqashot {{are unique}} in that <b>the</b> <b>melodies</b> were {{composed}} for pre-existing texts, unlike many more recent pizmonim where the words were composed to fit an existing, often non-Jewish, melody. It is also believed that <b>the</b> <b>melodies</b> of <b>the</b> Baqashot, unlike those of many pizmonim, are not borrowed from foreign sources.|$|R

5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and <b>the</b> <b>melody</b> and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; {{it is unclear whether}} the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E

5|$|Agungs {{also play}} a major role in agung orchestras—ensembles {{composed}} of large hanging, suspended or held, knobbed gongs which act as drones without any accompanying melodic instrument like a kulintang. Such orchestras are prevalent among Indigenous Philippine groups (Bagobo, Bilaan, Bukidon, Hanunoo, Magsaka, Manabo, Mangyan, Palawan, Subanun, Suludnon, T’boli, Tagakaolu, Tagbanwa and the Tiruray), regions in Kalimantan and Indonesia (Iban, Modang, Murut) and Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia (Bidayuh, Iban, Kadazan-Dusun, Kajan, Kayan), places where agung orchestras take precedence over kulintang-like orchestras. The composition and tuning of these orchestras vary widely from one group to another. For instance, the Hanunoo of Mindoro have a small agung ensemble consisting of only two light gongs played by two musicians on the floor in a simple duple rhythm while the Manobo have an ensemble (called an ahong) consisting of 10 small agungs hung vertically on a triangular frame. It includes three musicians: one standing up, playing <b>the</b> <b>melody,</b> and the rest sitting. The ahong is divided by purpose, with the higher-pitched gongs (kaantuhan) carrying <b>the</b> <b>melody,</b> three to four lower-pitched gongs (gandingan) playing melodic ostinato figures, and the lowest-pitched gong (bandil) setting the tempo.|$|E
5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating <b>the</b> <b>melody</b> and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>melodies</b> of {{folk music}} vary between regions. Generally those in {{pastoral}} areas are floating and wide-ranging. In {{the inner and}} southern Alps, however, <b>the</b> <b>melodies</b> are more songlike, and of more limited range. Common and popular themes are about love and the homeland, but patriotic and pastoral themes, as well as hunting themes, are also commonplace.|$|R

5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes <b>the</b> <b>melody.</b> Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Armstrong, most {{collective}} ensemble {{playing in}} jazz, {{along with its}} occasional solos, simply varied <b>the</b> <b>melodies</b> of <b>the</b> songs. Armstrong was virtually the first to create significant variations based on the chord harmonies of the songs instead of merely on <b>the</b> <b>melodies.</b> This opened a rich field for creation and improvisation, and significantly changed the music into a soloist's art form.|$|R
