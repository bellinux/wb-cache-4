5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, a {{third of}} Poland's {{population}} was composed of ethnic minorities. Poland had about 35 million inhabitants in 1939, but fewer than 24 million in 1946, within the respective borders. Of the remaining population over three million were ethnic minorities, such as Germans, Ukrainians and Jews, most of whom would soon leave Poland. Poland suffered the heaviest proportionate human losses during World War II, amounting to 16–17 percent of its population. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6 million Polish citizens died from war-related causes between 1939 and 1945. The approximate figure includes 3 million Jewish-Polish victims {{as part of the}} above total. The number of ethnically Polish victims was perhaps 2 million.|$|E

5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E

The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 500mm (20in) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh. There were reports of waves 15m (50ft) in height along the coast. A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in Rakhine State, causing damage to water systems. Flooding was visible on satellite imagery {{in the days}} following the cyclone. Eight townships in the state were affected, five of them severely.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Estimates show <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 500,000people {{living in}} the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk.

Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and it is estimated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, {{it is possible to}} acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that Bosnian Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the Holy War.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
