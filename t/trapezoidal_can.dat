The cyclic load levels for the trapezoidal fatigue loading tests were determined based on the short-term ramp loading test data. Compared with the long-term constant loading method, more damage will be accumulated {{in the same period}} of time during the trapezoidal fatigue loading test, so the total test time of the <b>trapezoidal</b> loading <b>can</b> be reduced.|$|R

40|$|In the {{representation}} of binary images or of binary three-dimensional scenes two principal paradigms have been introduced: boundary representation and hierarchical decomposition. The data-structure introduced in this paper, called function-tree or function-octree for a 3 D scene, is an elementary generalization of the standard quadtree and octree. It combines the compactness of a boundary representation of spatial data with the nice recursive properties of a tree representation. This is achieved by decomposing regularly an image into rectangular sub-images whose black regions are trapezoidal regions. A trapezoidal region (defined in detail in the paper) is a region below the graph of a function. <b>Trapezoidal</b> regions <b>can</b> be, in turn, efficiently encoded with a boundary representation. Efficient algorithms to construct the function-tree are described in the paper.

40|$|This paper investigates {{shifting}} {{the fundamental frequency}} of plate structures by corrugation. Creating corrugations significantly improves the flexural rigidities of plate and hence increases its natural frequencies. Two types of corrugations are investigated: sinusoidal and trapezoidal corrugations. The finite element method (FEM) is used to model the corrugated plates and extract the natural frequencies and mode shapes. The effects of corrugation geometrical parameters on simply supported plate fundamental frequency are studied. To reduce the computation time, the corrugated plates are modeled as orthotropic flat plates with equivalent rigidities. To demonstrate the validity of modeling the corrugated plates as orthotropic flat plates in studying the free vibration characteristics, a comparison between the results of finite element model and equivalent orthotropic models is made. A correspondence between the results of orthotropic models and the FE models is observed. The optimal designs of sinusoidal and trapezoidal corrugated plates are obtained based on a genetic algorithm. The optimization results show that plate corrugations can efficiently maximize plate fundamental frequency. It is found that the <b>trapezoidal</b> corrugation <b>can</b> more efficiently enhance the fundamental frequency of simply supported plate than the sinusoidal corrugation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the delivery of electron arc treatment with a trapezoidal aperture. The aim of the investigation {{is to reduce the}} nonuniformity of the dose distribution, which is caused by the variation of the patient contour from superior to inferior. The characteristics of static electron beam were first investigated. Then a measurement-based algorithm was developed and implemented as a computer program called EarcMU to calculate the monitor units required for delivering the prescribed dose with a trapezoidal aperture. The central axis percentage depth dose was found to be independent of source-to-surface distance (SSD) and the width of the aperture. The inplane profiles of a trapezoidal aperture show that the dose decreases longitudinally from the wide to the narrow end of the trapezoidal aperture. The EarcMU program was verified using two cylindrical water phantoms. The measured dose and the dose calculated by the program agreed within 2. 1 % in the typical clinical conditions. A simple method was also proposed for determining the trapezoidal aperture for an individual patient. Under the same conditions, the trapezoidal apertures calculated by this method along with the open aperture were used to deliver treatments to several conical phantoms. Significant improvement in the uniformity of dose distribution was observed. On average, the flatness index of the longitudinal dose distribution from superior to inferior decreases dramatically from 8 % for open aperture down to 0. 58 % for trapezoidal aperture. The results are clinically significant, indicating that delivering the electron arc treatment using a <b>trapezoidal</b> aperture <b>can</b> bring more uniform dose to the patient regardless of the change of patient contour from superior to inferior...|$|R
