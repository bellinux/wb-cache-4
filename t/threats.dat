5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are <b>threats</b> or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating <b>threats</b> and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting <b>threats</b> from non-freedom-restricting <b>threats.</b> He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting <b>threats,</b> for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E

Participants in three conditions (control, stereotype <b>threat,</b> stereotype <b>threat</b> + affirmation) completed a statistics test.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the effects of}} stereotype <b>threat</b> on memory and subjective age were moderated by positive age stereotypes and self-perceptions of aging among older adults.

Results showed that stereotype <b>threat</b> (high vs. low <b>threat)</b> {{did not affect the}} dependent variables. Moreover, self-perceptions of aging did not moderate the effect of stereotype <b>threat</b> on the dependent variables. However, for people with more positive age stereotypes, older people under high <b>threat</b> perceived more <b>threat</b> than people under low <b>threat.</b> This could be explained by an effect of age stereotypes in the high-threat group: the more positive age stereotypes held by participants, the more they perceived <b>threat,</b> which in turn decreased their memory performance and made them feel mentally older. We hypothesized that age group identity is stronger in people with more positive age stereotypes, which increase perceived <b>threat.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{healthcare}} services is motivating hospitals to strengthen outpatient case management using information systems in order to serve more patients using the available resources. Though the use of information systems in outpatient case management raises patient data security concerns, it was established that the current approaches to information systems risk analysis do not provide logical recipes for quantifying <b>threat</b> impact and determining the cost-effectiveness of risk mitigation controls. Quantifying {{the likelihood of the}} <b>threat</b> and determining its potential impact is key in deciding whether to adopt a given information system or not. Therefore, this thesis proposes the <b>Threat</b> Nets Approach organized into 4 service recipes, namely: <b>threat</b> likelihood assessment service, <b>threat</b> impact evaluation service, return on investment assessment service and coordination management. The <b>threat</b> likelihood assessment service offers recipes for determining the likelihood of a <b>threat.</b> The <b>threat</b> impact evaluation service offers techniques of computing the impact of the <b>threat</b> on the organization. The return on investment assessment service offers recipes of determining the cost-effectiveness of <b>threat</b> mitigation controls. To support the application of the approach, a ThreNet tool was developed. The approach was evaluated by experts to ascertain its usability and usefulness. Evaluation of the <b>Threat</b> Nets Approach by the experts shows that it provides complete, usable and useful recipes for the assessment of; <b>threat</b> likelihood, <b>threat</b> impact and cost-effectiveness of <b>threat</b> mitigation controls. The results suggest that the application of <b>Threat</b> Nets approach is effective in quantifying risks to information system...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} evaluated differential predictions {{from two}} cognitive formulations of anxiety. According to one view, attentional biases for <b>threat</b> reflect vulnerability to anxiety; and as <b>threat</b> inputs increase, high trait anxious individuals should become more vigilant, and low trait individuals more avoidant, of <b>threat</b> (Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1988, 1997). However, {{according to a}} "cognitive-motivational" view, trait anxiety influences the appraisal of stimulus <b>threat</b> value, rather than the direction of attentional bias, and both high and low trait anxious individuals should exhibit greater vigilance for high rather than mild <b>threat</b> stimuli (Mogg & Bradley, 1998). To test these predictions, two experiments examined the effect of manipulating stimulus <b>threat</b> value on the direction of attentional bias. The stimuli included high <b>threat</b> and mild <b>threat</b> pictorial scenes presented in a probe detection task. Results from both studies indicated {{a significant main effect}} of stimulus <b>threat</b> value on attentional bias, as there was increased vigilance or reduced avoidance of <b>threat,</b> as <b>threat</b> value increased. This effect was found even within low trait anxious individuals, consistent with the "cognitive-motivational" view. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed...|$|R

The FWHR correlated positively with aspects of physical <b>threat</b> potential in men and women, and an aspect of psychological <b>threat</b> potential in men. Additionally, study 1 investigated {{the extent to which}} these types of <b>threat</b> potential differentially predict aggression. In men only, psychological <b>threat</b> potential predicted non-costly aggression, and physical <b>threat</b> potential predicted costly aggression. In study 2, participants made inferences about the <b>threat</b> potential of participants from study 1. Results demonstrated an ability to infer <b>threat</b> potential from the face, and sex differences related to the definition of aggressiveness. Together, these findings demonstrate that the FWHR conveys two forms of <b>threat</b> potential in men, which differentially predict aggression...|$|R
