5|$|In 1910s, London, Nurse Helen Chester (Jacqueline Pierreux) {{is called}} to a large house to prepare the corpse of an elderly medium for her burial. As she dresses the body, she notices a {{sapphire}} ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over {{a glass of water}} which drips on the floor; she is then assailed by a fly. Chester takes her ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her, and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester finds the woman's corpse lying in her bed. It rises and floats toward her. Chester begs for forgiveness, but ultimately strangles herself. The next morning, <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> (Harriet White Medin) discovers Chester's body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where her ring once was. As the doctor announces this observation, <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Paris, Custine {{displayed}} his usual , {{which seemed to}} exasperate his political enemies. He took private rooms in a furnished hotel, and rented a room for his secretary. He visited his son and daughter-in-law, and carried on his usual Parisian social calendar: he appeared in all the public places, at the Palais-Royal and the theater, and was received with noisy ovations and shouts of Vive Custine! The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, {{he was arrested and}} imprisoned in the Luxembourg. On 23 July, the news came that Mainz had capitulated; on 28 July came the news of the loss of Valenciennes.

25|$|Although Mani {{was blamed}} and {{ultimately}} fired for Velocity's advert having the wrong focus, {{it had in}} fact been Ansell that initially mentioned <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> aspect to the team. However, Ruth decided to bring Mani back instead, as though Ansell had apologised off-camera and admitted his mistake during the initial boardroom, Mani also mentioned the service, and was extremely rude to Ruth throughout the task, with his refusal to accept any blame for the misleading briefing being a contributing factor to his firing. On his appearance on You're Fired! Mani later admitted that if Ansell hadn't mentioned <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> service, then he probably would have.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Invicta {{settled on}} a {{campaign}} theme revolving around magic and card tricks, though the team ran behind schedule with their billboard and video, and {{had to wait for}} the sub-team filming the inside of the plane. Meanwhile, Velocity focused on promoting the card's feature, yet despite a clear strategy from Ruth, their campaign focused on <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> service of the card rather than the ease of booking the jet with it. Sir Alan was unimpressed with their campaign for making this mistake, and stated that, while it was somewhat clichéd and not especially impressive, Invicta's campaign was closer to what he wanted, and declared them the winners.|$|E

Mark staggers to the house's foyer where Carol and the nurse put him to bed.|$|E
25|$|After the attack, Lucheni fled {{down the}} Rue des Alpes, where {{he threw the}} file into the {{entrance}} to No. 3. He was caught by two cabdrivers and a sailor, then secured by a gendarme. The weapon was found the next day by <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> during his morning cleaning; he thought it belonged to a laborer who had moved {{the day before and}} did not notify the police of his discovery until the following day. There was no blood on the file and the tip was broken off, which occurred when Lucheni threw it away. The file was so dull in appearance it was speculated that it had been deliberately selected because it would be less noticeable than a shiny knife, which would have given Lucheni away as he approached. Lucheni had planned to purchase a stiletto, but lacking the price of 12 francs he had simply sharpened an old file into a homemade dagger and cut down a piece of firewood into a handle.|$|E

500|$|In a hotel lobby, <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> answers a {{phone call}} from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, {{watching}} the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from <b>the</b> <b>concierge</b> in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless.

500|$|In January 2014, Stanford Corp. said {{it would}} spend $30 million {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 2014 to renovate all meeting space and the fitness facility, lobby, pool, and restaurants at the facility.

The company also said it might lease the facility to Hilton, Marriott, or Starwood, and had not yet decided whether to retain [...] "L'Enfant Plaza" [...] as part of the name or seek a new moniker relevant to some other part of the nearby National Mall.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{said the}} video's {{production}} was ambitious, stating: [...] "It's an incredible challenge {{to make a}} creative clip of a song without the artist." [...] He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously {{because he was the}} first to commit to his role as the bellboy. Nelson says that Coolio's role [...] "provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video." [...] Yvette Lang, who executive produced the clip for F.M. Rocks, described the filming to be like a [...] "big party" [...] to show their support for Shakur. Ice-T's role as the hotel concierge was not originally intended. At first, there was a comedian set to play his role, but he ended up cancelling at the last minute. Since Ice-T was only available to shoot in the morning, Nelson decided to make him <b>the</b> <b>concierge.</b> The director called it a [...] "strange blessing" [...] since he is more memorable as a concierge, rather than his intended role.|$|E
