40|$|This study {{suggests}} that contemporary modular acetabular shell designs employing ceramic liners deform during implantation where acetabular bed under-reaming is employed. The liner retention strength did not degrade by comparison to non-deformed shells using ASTM static push-out methods. A larger question, however, is the influence of this deformation on liner retention strength over time when both bone remodeling and cyclic activity occur. The idealization of component seating in the laboratory where surface contaminants, component position, and loading are controlled does not typify the operating room environment where liner seating is often an issue. Nevertheless, in this optimal situation, shell deformation was consistently observed as was striping on outer ceramic liner surfaces. Factors influencing the failure to seat components, as has been reported, need to be further documented. This study evaluates both metal banded and non-banded ceramic liners of like ceramic composition where a <b>taper</b> <b>lock</b> is utilized to achieve fixation. A further consideration, in this regard, may be the mismatch of shell-band stiffness where both CoCrMo and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V are employed. It {{is more likely that}} a CoCrMo band will diminish the possibility of any ceramic liner deformation because of its increased stiffness. Any amount of ceramic liner deformation can impact ceramic couple function particular to clearance an...|$|E
50|$|A <b>tapered</b> <b>lock</b> {{is a form}} of keyless {{shaft locking}} device that does not require any {{material}} to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer {{to the center of the}} shaft. An alternative coupling device to the traditional parallel key, the <b>tapered</b> <b>lock</b> removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways. It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.|$|R

50|$|The tapered key is tapered only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a taper that matches that of the tapered key. Some taper keys have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the taper is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with taper keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a <b>tapered</b> shaft <b>lock</b> in that <b>tapered</b> keys have a matching taper on the keyway, while <b>tapered</b> shaft <b>locks</b> do not.|$|R
2500|$|The Glock 17 is a 9 mm short recoil–operated, locked-breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol.

During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about [...] until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension {{at the base of}} the barrel then interacts with a <b>tapered</b> <b>locking</b> block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{following}} the initial {{successes of the}} Synthodont implant, Driskell et al. introduced the Titanodont implant. The Titanodont implant was composed of surgical grade titanium (grade 5, Ti-6Al-4V). The Titanodont implant was unique for three main reasons. First, the Titanodont implant allowed for complete interchangeability with abutments of varying diameters and angles. This interchangeability allowed for a more natural biological width. Second, the implant was grit blasted and acid etched, which provided both a larger surface area and more preferable substrate for cells involved in osseointegration. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Titanodont implant had a <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> abutment connection, which allowed 360° of abutment positioning, along with a bacterial seal. Unlike screw-form implants, the <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> connection design prevents the infiltration of bacteria into the implant crypt and surrounding tissues.|$|R

The company specializes in short dental {{implants}} that use a <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> or cold welding connection {{to secure the}} abutment to the implant. Bicon is notable and worthy of mention for the following three reasons: First, Bicon implants are extremely short in length. The size of Bicon implants {{allow them to be}} placed in regions that are crowded with natural teeth and/or implants, or in regions that would otherwise require bone grafting.Second, the implants do not have the screw-form design typical of other available implants. [...] Third, the abutments are connected to the implant via a <b>locking</b> <b>taper.</b> This is notable from both a medical and engineering standpoint as no other implant company offers an implant with a biological seal at the implant/abutment interface; almost all other implants possess an internal screw to connect their abutments.|$|R
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM. Unlike screw-{{retention}} type, fixture-abutment retention in <b>Locking</b> <b>taper</b> connection {{depends on}} frictional force {{so it has}} possibility of abutment to sink. PURPOSE. In this study, Bicon � Implant System, one of the conical internal connection implant system, was used with applying loading force to the abutments connected to the fixture. Then the amount of sinking was measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS. 10 Bicon � implant fixtures were used. First, the abutment {{was connected to the}} fixture with finger force. Then it was tapped with a mallet for 3 times and loads of 20 kg corresponding to masticatory force using loading application instrument were applied successively. The abutment state, slightly connected to the fixture without pressure was considered as a reference length, and every new abutment length was measured after each load’s step was added. The amount of abutment sinking (mm) was gained by subtracting the length of abutmentfixture under each loading condition from reference length. RESULTS. It was evident, that the amount of abutment sinking in Bicon � Implant System increased as loads were added. When loads of 20 kg were applied more than 5 - 7 times, sinking stopped at 0. 45 ± 0. 09 mm. CONCLUSION. Even though <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> connection type implant shows good adaption to occlusal force, it has potential for abutment sinking as loads are given. When <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> connection type implant is used, satisfactory loads are recommended for precise abutment location...|$|R
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this <b>taper</b> <b>locks</b> the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it <b>locks</b> the <b>tapered</b> split collets in place.|$|R

40|$|Background. Short {{implants}} {{have become}} {{popular in the}} reconstruction of jaws, especially in cases with limited bone height. Shorter implants, those with <b>locking</b> <b>tapers</b> and plateau root shapes, tend to have longer survival times. We retrospectively investigated the cumulative survival rates of Bicon short implants (< 8 [*]mm) according to patient variables over a 5 -year period. Materials and Methods. This study included 111 consecutively treated patients with 371 implants supporting fixed or removable prosthetics. Data were evaluated to acquire cumulative survival rates according to gender, age, tobacco use, surgical procedure, bone quality, and restoration type. Statistics were performed using chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis H tests. Results. The survival rate was 97. 3 % with, on average, 22. 8 months of follow-up. Patients older than 60 years had higher failure rate than the other age groups (P< 0. 05). Placed region, age, and bone quality had adverse effects on survival rate in the < 8 mm implant group with statistically significant difference (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. Approximately 23 -month follow-up data indicate that short implants with <b>locking</b> <b>tapers</b> and plateau-type roots have comparable survival rates as other types of dental implants. However, due to limitations of study, these issues remain to be further investigated in future randomized controlled clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{investigate}} whether the removal and reseating of the abutment influences {{the retention of}} Morse taper implant system. Methods: Two Morse taper implant systems were selected: Bicon Dental ImplantTM system (Bicon, LLC, Boston, MA, USA) and Kopp Implant(r) system (Kopp(r), Curitiba, PR, Brazil). In both systems, the abutment {{is connected to the}} implant with a <b>locking</b> <b>taper.</b> To seat the abutment, the same vertical force was applied in both systems. It was measured the compressive force necessary to engage effectively the <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> connection and the tensile force to displace it. Results: The compressive force was determined by four activations in each abutment-implant set, and the sum of these forces was 21 N and 17 N in the BiconTM and Kopp(r) systems, respectively. Next, a tensile test was performed, revealing that the BiconTM system presented a 208 N resistance, whereas it was 194 N in the Kopp(r) system. Other three rounds of compression and tensile loads were applied, removing and reseating the abutment. We obtained the following tensile values: 367 N, 500 N and 756 N in the BiconTM System and 336 N, 360 N and 420 N in the Kopp(r) system.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2009. Major: Dentistry. Advisor: James R. Holtan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 31 pages. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM. Successful implant treatment requires a favorable biological response of living tissues {{to a foreign}} material. Even with a favorable pre-surgical evaluation, negative changes such as crestal bone loss can occur after the implant is placed, which can result in an esthetic failure. Controlling crestal bone loss around an implant placed adjacent to a natural tooth or to another implant represents an important challenge for present day prosthodontics. Guidelines on the distance between an implant and a natural tooth or another implant have been published as being {{an important factor in}} proximal bone preservation. PURPOSE. The {{purpose of this study was}} to retrospectively evaluate pre-treatment and post-treatment proximal bone levels of a single tooth, plateau-designed, press fit implants (Bicon®) utilizing a <b>locking</b> <b>tapered,</b> implant to abutment connection adjacent to a natural teeth and to a plateau design Bicon® implants. The bone levels were evaluated separately for those implants that were closer to a natural tooth or to another implant than the recommended guidelines. Bone levels were also measured on mesial and distal surfaces of all implants as well as the crestal bone levels between 2 implants. The relationship between implant spacing and crestal bone levels was to be determined. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate pre-treatment and post-treatment proximal bone levels of a single tooth, plateau-designed, press fit implants (Bicon®) utilizing a <b>locking</b> <b>tapered,</b> implant to abutment connection adjacent to a natural teeth and to a plateau design Bicon® implants. The cohort was derived from patients who received 1 or more single tooth, plateau-designed, press fit implants between 1995 and 2005. One hundred and sixty-nine implants with 338 proximal surfaces were included in this study. Of the 338 proximal surfaces, 120 were adjacent to a natural tooth, 192 were adjacent to an implant, and the remaining 26 surfaces were adjacent to an edentulous area. The mean follow-up time was 4 ± 2. 3 years. Bone levels and changes in bone levels over time were determined by direct measurement of non-standardized digital periapical radiographs. All measurements were made by using a software measuring tool (DIGORA; Soredex, Tuusula, Finland) at × 3. 0 magnification. Student T-tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance between pre-treatment and post-treatment proximal bone levels of natural teeth adjacent to implants. Level of significance was set to alpha 0. 05. Descriptive statistics were used to report bone levels on implants adjacent to a natural tooth, another implant, or an edentulous area, as well as the crestal bone levels between 2 implants. RESULTS. There was no significant difference (P= 0. 25) between pre-treatment proximal bone levels and post-treatment proximal bone levels on a single tooth, plateau-designed, press fit implants (Bicon®) utilizing a <b>locking</b> <b>tapered,</b> implant to abutment connection adjacent to a natural teeth and plateau design Bicon® implants. CONCLUSIONS. Bone levels on implant surfaces adjacent to another implant and bone levels on natural teeth adjacent to implants can be expected to remain unchanged post-treatment when a single tooth, plateau-designed, press fit implant is placed closer than the recommended distance away from the natural tooth or to another implant...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was done to}} investigate the effects of taper on vortex shedding coherence on High Mast Lighting Towers (HMLTs) with models of 8 -, 12 -, and 16 -sided polygonal cross-section. The models are mounted on springs to recreate a flutter phenomenon seen on high mast lighting towers and left to move freely (with an extra 2 ̆ 2 clamped 2 ̆ 2 or stationary configuration) within the wind tunnel in the cross-wind direction. Later, the model was forced to oscillate at specified frequencies and amplitudes and the resulting wake and surface pressures were recorded and compared to the freemoving and clamped cases. The study aims to study {{the characteristics of a}} 2 ̆ 2 lock-in 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon, that is, a range of diameters where instead of different shedding frequencies for different diameters, there is a single shedding frequency for different diameters. This goes contrary to the standard for vortex shedding model characterized by the Strouhal relation. Results show the existence of vortex cell shedding for clamped models. Using a motor and a forcing cam to recreate the elastic movement of the HMLT in ambient conditions has yielded a specific range of diameters to determine the size of the locked in vortex cells. According to standard Department of Transportation manufacturing standards for <b>taper,</b> the <b>lock</b> in distance for small excitations (0. 1 inches) would be approximately 10 feet in size in the spanwise direction.

The images of the samples, acquired by the X-ray micro-tomography, after being processed with a dedicated software, showed a greater contact height (CH) in the implant-abutment sample (3, 57 mm) compared to the implant-healing cap sample (2, 52 mm).

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{strength}} to failure and fracture mode of three indirect composite materials directly applied onto Ti- 6 Al- 4 V implant abutments vs cemented standard porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crowns. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four <b>locking</b> <b>taper</b> abutments were randomly allocated to four groups and were cleaned in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. After drying under ambient conditions, the abutments were grit blasted and a custom 4 -cusp molar crown mold was utilized to produce identical crowns (n = 16 per group) of Tescera (Bisco), Ceramage (Shofu), and Diamond Crown (DRM) according to the manufacturer`s instructions. The porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns were fabricated by conventional means involving the construction and a wax pattern and casting of a metallic coping followed by sintering of increasing layers of porcelain. All crowns were loaded to failure by an indenter placed {{at one of the}} cusp tips at a 1 mm/min rate. Subsequently, fracture analysis was performed by means of stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. One-way ANOVA at 95 % level of significance was utilized for statistical analysis. Results: The single load to failure (+/- SD) results were: Tescera (1130 +/- 239 N), Ceramage (1099 +/- 257 N), Diamond Crown (1155 +/- 284 N), and PFM (1081 +/- 243 N).
