50|$|A {{variation}} of the standing martingale, called a <b>tiedown,</b> is seen almost exclusively in the western riding disciplines. A <b>tiedown</b> is adjusted much shorter than a standing martingale and is intended primarily to prevent the horse from flipping its head up when asked to abruptly stop or turn in speed events. Users also claim that it gives the horse something to brace against for balance. It consists of an adjustable strap, one end which attaches to the horse's breastplate and the other which attaches to a noseband on the bridle. The noseband can be of leather, but may also be of lariat rope, or even plastic-covered cable, which can make the western <b>tiedown</b> considerably harsher than the English-style standing martingale. It is properly adjusted when it puts no pressure on the horse's nose when held at a normal position, but will immediately act if the horse raises its nose {{more than a few}} inches.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} Passive {{trackers}} use a low boiling point compressed gas fluid that is driven {{to one side}} or the other (by solar heat creating gas pressure) to cause the tracker to move in response to an imbalance. As this is a non-precision orientation it is unsuitable for certain types of concentrating photovoltaic collectors but works fine for common PV panel types. These will have viscous dampers to prevent excessive motion in response to wind gusts. Shader/reflectors are used to reflect early morning sunlight to [...] "wake up" [...] the panel and tilt it toward the Sun, which can take nearly an hour. The time to do this can be greatly reduced by adding a self-releasing <b>tiedown</b> that positions the panel slightly past the zenith (so that the fluid does not have to overcome gravity) and using the <b>tiedown</b> in the evening. (A slack-pulling spring will prevent release in windy overnight conditions.) ...|$|R
