25|$|At the Santa Fe campus, {{there is}} a program {{offering}} a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics (M.A.E.C.). This program is three semesters long and {{is designed to be}} completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not do justice to the Great Books of the three main Asian traditions (India, China and Japan) by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only Confucius, Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also Mencius, Xun Zi, Han Feizi, and Mozi, as well as historical narratives by Sima Qian and the Zuo Zhuan, the later movement of Neo-Confucianism and Zhu Xi, narrative works such as Journey to the West or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the great Chinese poets, Li Bai, Wang Wei and Du Fu. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of Hinduism and the development of Theravada, Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, as well as such literary masterpieces as the Mahabharata, Shakuntala, The Tale of Genji, The Narrow Road to the Deep North and others. Students also take a language, either Sanskrit or Classical Chinese.|$|E

Larry Fitzmaurice of Spin accused EMI of planning to [...] "issue and reissue [...] discography until the cash stops rolling in", and Pitchforks Ryan Dombal said it was [...] "hard to look at these reissues as anything other than a cash-grab for EMI/Capitol—an old media company that got dumped by their most forward-thinking band." [...] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone defended EMI, saying: [...] "While it's easy to accuse Capitol of milking the cash cow once again, these sets are pretty comprehensive." ...|$|E

Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer.

The author of the article commented: [...] "Just as Australia and other Western donors are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> [...] rebel Government, China has {{dramatically}} stepped up its aid, effectively dissipating any pressure Western donors might have been generating."

2500|$|A {{public health}} effort to {{eliminate}} all cases of poliomyelitis (polio) infection around the world, begun in 1988 and led by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Rotary Foundation, has {{reduced the number of}} annual diagnosed cases from the hundreds of thousands to 37 confirmed cases in 2016. Of the three strains of polio virus, the last recorded wild case caused by type 2 (WPV2) was in 1999. Type 3 (WPV3) is last known to have caused polio on 11 November 2012, with all wild-virus cases since that date being due to type 1 (WPV1). [...] Mutated vaccine strains can also result in polio, and so-called circulating vaccine-derived cases of type 1 (cVDPV1) and 2 (cVDPV2) continue to be detected. [...] If polio is the next disease to be successfully eradicated, this will represent only the third time this has ever been achieved, after smallpox and rinderpest. The goal of eradicating polio worldwide has attracted international and media attention, with a reduction of some 99% of cases {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century. The first 10 years of the 21st century saw only erratic progress in further reducing the number of cases, which led to getting rid of the last 1% being described as [...] "like <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> Jell-O to death". Since 2011 incidence rates of the disease have dramatically reduced, and with large reductions continuing through to 2017, hopes for eliminating polio have been rekindled. India is the latest country to have officially stopped endemic transmission of polio—with its last reported case in 2011. Only three countries remain where the disease is endemic—Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. The number of wild polio cases reported in 2015 was less than a third of the previous lowest year, 2012, while 2016 halved this figure to 37 cases.|$|E

2500|$|A {{woman named}} Obavva, {{the wife of}} a soldier called Maddha Hanumappa, was {{guarding}} a fort tower, substituting for her husband during a lunch break. She was guarding the Chitradurga Fort at a crack opening, a secret opening where only one person could barely squeeze through. Her heroics have entered the annals of legendary folklore of the Karnataka State. While fetching water, she heard the muted sounds of enemy soldiers attempting to enter the fort through the crevice. With great presence of mind she immediately hid behind the crevice in the fort and hit at each soldier <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>squeeze</b> through the crevice with onake, the name given in Kannada to a masse or pestle, a wooden rod used for pounding paddy. In this process, she bravely killed several enemy soldiers. By the time her husband appeared on the scene, she had already dragged several bodies of dead soldiers into the fort wall and was standing around the dead bodies with the blood stained onake in her hand. Maddha Hanumappa blew the bugle, and other soldiers joined him and killed all the enemy soldiers. This brave act saved the fort on that day from further attacks by Hyder Ali’s soldiers. Her heroic act was commemorated with her impressive statue (sculpted by Ashok Gudigar) erected in front of the District Commissioner’s office in Chittradurga town. The stadium in the town was named after her. This act earned her the epithet [...] "Onake Obavva" [...] and the crevice in the fort where she showed her bravery is called [...] "Onake Kindi".
