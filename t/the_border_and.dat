It is a major city on the European Union roadways (Via Baltica) and railways (Rail Baltica) to the Baltic Republics and Finland. It is also a main gateway of trade with Belarus due to its proximity to <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> its current and longstanding relationship with Hrodno, Belarus.|$|E
5|$|With {{medical and}} other non combat units, the force totalled around 2,000 men. Intelligence {{gathered}} supported {{the theory that}} Dinar was going to invade Sudan, so in March 1916 Wingate ordered Kelly to cross <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> occupy Jebel el Hella and Um Shanga. The two villages offered the only permanent water supplies {{that were on the}} road to El Fasher, Dinar's capital.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Turkish forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the {{division}} to attack Rafa on the Egyptian–Palestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> <b>and</b> the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east. The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving around to the north of village, when the Turkish defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the Turkish withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 {{straddles}} the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town}} of Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} phases, British and Malaysian troops had {{attempted}} only to control <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> <b>and</b> to protect population centres. However, {{by the time}} the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing borders to obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{continued}} west up the Thames Valley, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; {{he hoped}} to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders. Mortimer and Isabella were not far behind. Proclamations condemned the Despensers' recent regime. Day-by-day they gathered new supporters Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> set sail from Chepstow, probably aiming first for Lundy and then for Ireland, where the King hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army. Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at Cardiff. Edward retreated to Caerphilly Castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1814 {{under the}} new and ambitious Governor-General Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, the long-standing {{diplomatic}} disputes between British India and the Kingdom of Nepal, caused by expansionist policies of both parties, descended into open hostility. The British East India Company sought to invade Nepal not just to secure <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> to force the Nepali government to open trading routes to Tibet, but also for what Hastings saw as a geo-political necessity to secure the foothold of the Company in the Indian sub-continent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1632 a well-prepared Russian army took a number of strongholds on the Lithuanian side of <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> {{commenced}} a siege of Smolensk. The well-fortified city was able to withstand a general onslaught followed by a ten-month encirclement by an overwhelming force led by Mikhail Shein. At that time a Commonwealth rescue expedition of comparable strength arrived, under the highly effective military command of Władysław IV. After months of fierce fighting, in February 1634 Shein capitulated. The Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed the Deulino territorial arrangements with small adjustments {{in favor of the}} Tsardom. Władysław had relinquished, upon monetary compensation, his claims to the Russian throne.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 12th and early 13th centuries <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> {{political}} relationship between England and Scotland was disputed, with {{the kings of}} Scotland claiming parts {{of what is now}} northern England. John's father, Henry II, had forced William the Lion to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174. This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189, but the relationship remained uneasy. John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties. He refused William's request for the earldom of Northumbria, but did not intervene in Scotland itself and focused on his continental problems. The two kings maintained a friendly relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207, until it was rumoured in 1209 that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France. John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham, which gave John control of William's daughters and required a payment of £10,000. This effectively crippled William's power north of <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> <b>and</b> by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals. John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise, though, and both William and Alexander in turn remained independent kings, supported by, but not owing fealty to, John.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major supply base for {{supporting}} the Spanish uprising against Napoleon. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison to cross <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, {{as well as the}} old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege Gibraltar or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of Gibraltar, but did not attempt to target Gibraltar itself as they believed that it was impregnable. The French besieged Tarifa, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave up after a month. Gibraltar faced no further military threat for a century.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1940, a {{train with}} workers from Trondheim {{to the airport}} {{collided}} with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains {{were supposed to have}} passed at Homnmelvik Station, but the engineer thought he had seen the other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light to see with, since all outdoor sources of light were covered. On 23 January 1941, a coke and coal train from Sweden lost its braking between <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> Kopperå. The six back cars plus the caboose derailed just west of Kopperå Station, while the locomotive and 17 other trains continued their wild flight. The train derailed at Meråker Station, and the Meråker train disaster killed both the engineer and the stoker.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April a South Vietnamese armored {{task force}} crossed the Cambodian border {{into the area}} known as the Parrot's Beak, {{northwest}} of Saigon. The following day a multi-division U.S./South Vietnamese force rolled over <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> into the area known as the Fishhook, north of Saigon and opposite Binh Long Province. With the exception of heavy fighting at the town of Snoul, PAVN/NLF resistance was light {{since most of the}} North Vietnamese had been withdrawn from the border regions for operations against FANK. In quick succession, all of the border sanctuaries were struck, to one degree or another, by U.S. or South Vietnamese forces.|$|E

5|$|Pakistan, {{attempting}} {{to force the}} issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared {{that it would have}} to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Rhys had {{nominated}} {{his eldest}} legitimate son, Gruffydd ap Rhys, as his successor, {{and soon after}} his father's death Gruffydd met the Justiciar, Archbishop Hubert Walter, on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> was confirmed as heir. Maelgwn, the eldest son but illegitimate, refused to accept this and was given military assistance by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys. Maelgwn took the town and castle of Aberystwyth and captured Gruffydd, whom he {{handed over to the}} custody of Gwenwynwyn. Gwenwynwyn later handed him over to the king, who imprisoned him at Corfe Castle. Gruffydd was set free the following year and regained most of Ceredigion. In 1201 Gruffydd died, but this did not end the fighting between rival claimants. In 1216 Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd held a council at Aberdyfi where he allocated parts of Deheubarth to several sons and grandsons of Rhys.|$|E
5|$|Since 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of {{ammunition}} had traveled {{through the maze}} of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring Cambodia known as the Sihanouk Trail. However, following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in 1970, the pro-American Lon Nol regime had denied the use of the port of Sihanoukville to communist shipping. Strategically, this was an enormous blow to the North Vietnamese effort, since 70 percent of all military supplies that supported its effort in the far south had moved through the port. A further blow to the logistical system in Cambodia had come {{in the spring and summer}} of 1970, when U.S. and ARVN forces had crossed <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>and</b> attacked PAVN/NLF Base Areas during the Cambodian Campaign.|$|E
