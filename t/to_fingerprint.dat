In so doing, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprinting {{has served}} all governments {{worldwide}} {{during the past}} 100 years or so to provide identification of criminals. Fingerprints are the fundamental tool in every police agency for the identification of people with a criminal history. They remain the most commonly gathered forensic evidence worldwide, and in most jurisdictions fingerprint examination is more common than all other forensic examination casework combined. Moreover, it continues to expand, {{with tens of thousands}} of people added <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> repositories daily in America alone— far more than other forensic databases.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} unified {{framework}} {{based on a}} general definition of geometric transform (GeT) for modeling appearance. GeT represents the appearance by applying designed functionals over certain geometric sets. We show that image warping, Radon transform, trace transform, etc. are special cases of our definition. Moreover, three different types of GeTs are designed to handle deformation, articulation and occlusion and applied <b>to</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> the appearance inside a contour. They include the contour-driven GeT, the feature curve based GeT and selecting functionals to model the appearance inside the convex hull of the contour. A multi-resolution representation that combines both shape and appearance information is also proposed. We apply our approach to image synthesis and object recognition. The proposed approach produces promising results when applied <b>to</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> the appearance of human and body parts despite the challenges due to articulated motion and deformations. 1...|$|R

After taking over 46,500 sets of fingerprints, a match was made with Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman. Griffiths admitted his guilt and his trial ascertained if he was sane or not. After deliberating for 23 minutes, the jury found him sane and he was hanged at Liverpool Prison on Friday 19 November 1948. After his conviction, the police destroyed all fingerprints they had taken.|$|E

25|$|More bands {{provide more}} {{discrete}} information, or greater resolution. The characteristic emission and absorption spectra serve <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> or define {{the makeup of}} the feature that was observed. A radiometric plot represents the radiant intensity versus time; there can be plots at multiple bands or wavelengths. For each point along a time-intensity radiometric plot, a spectral plot can be generated {{based on the number of}} spectral bands in the collector, such as the radiant intensity plot of a missile exhaust plume as the missile is in flight. The intensity or brightness of the object is a function of several conditions including its temperature, surface properties or material, and how fast it is moving. Remember that additional, non-electro-optical sensors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, can correlate with these bands.|$|E

25|$|There {{were reports}} that Karadžić evaded capture in May 2007 in Vienna, where he lived under the name Petar Glumac, posing as a Croatian seller of herbal {{solutions}} and ointments. Austrian police talked to him during the raid regarding an unrelated homicide case {{in the area where}} Karadžić lived but failed to recognize his real identity. He had obtained a Croatian passport in the name of Petar Glumac and claimed to be in Vienna for training. The police did not ask any further questions nor demanded <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> him as he appeared calm and readily answered questions. Nevertheless, this claim came into doubt when a man named Petar Glumac, an alternative medical practitioner from Banatsko Novo Selo, Serbia, claims to have been the person the police talked with in Vienna. Glumac reportedly bears a striking resemblance to Karadžić's appearance as Dragan Dabić. Dragan Karadžić, his nephew, claimed in an interview to the Corriere della Sera that Karadžić attended football matches of Serie A and visited Venice under the name of Petar Glumac.|$|E
500|$|Cartridges {{are also}} {{routinely}} examined for fingerprints as {{the act of}} loading the ammunition into the magazine, or chamber, leaves recoverable impressions. [...] These fingerprints can survive the firing processes and, while a rare occurrence, fingerprints have been obtained from cartridges recovered from the scene. Cartridges are subjected to cyanoacrylate fuming and examined for any usable prints. Usable prints are photographed and can be uploaded <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> databases such as IAFIS for comparison with known exemplars. Cartridges can also be swabbed for trace DNA left by the individual who loaded the magazine. The extremely low levels of recoverable DNA present the same issues as swabbing a firearm for DNA.|$|E
2500|$|The Generalized Steno Law {{states that}} the {{interfacial}} angles between identical faces of any single crystal of the same material are, by nature, restricted to the same value. This offers the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> crystalline materials {{on the basis of}} optical goniometry, which is also known as crystallometry. In order to employ this technique successfully, one must consider the observed point group symmetry of the measured faces and creatively apply the rule that [...] "crystal morphologies are often combinations of simple (i.e. low multiplicity) forms where the individual faces have the lowest possible Miller indices for any given zone axis". This shall ensure that the correct indexing of the crystal faces is obtained for any single crystal.|$|E

2500|$|Serious {{concerns}} about the security implications of using conventional biometric templates in schools have been raised {{by a number of}} leading IT security experts, one of whom has voiced the opinion that [...] "it is absolutely premature to begin using 'conventional biometrics' in schools". The vendors of biometric systems claim that their products bring benefits to schools such as improved reading skills, decreased wait times in lunch lines and increased revenues. They do not cite independent research to support this view. One education specialist wrote in 2007: [...] "I {{have not been able to}} find a single piece of published research which suggests that the use of biometrics in schools promotes healthy eating or improves reading skills amongst children... There is absolutely no evidence for such claims". The Ottawa Police in Canada have advised parents who fear their children may be kidnapped, <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> their children.|$|E

In May 2016, Uber pulled its Austin program due to stricter {{regulations}} from the government. Compared to most taxi companies in the United States, which use Live Scan, a fingerprinting service that checks for matches in FBI and state databases, Uber's background check policy in Texas has been critiqued for not being as safe. The only cities where Uber mandates fingerprint scanning are New York, where a fingerprint scan is needed to apply for a Taxi and Limousine Commission license, and Houston, which has required fingerprint scans for ride sharing drivers since 2014. However, Uber claims that the extra step of fingerprinting drivers in Houston has slowed down driver sign-ups, and as a result wait times are on average 35% longer. In May 2016, Uber stopped operations in Austin, Texas after the city [...] "...voted 56% to 44% against Proposition 1, which would have allowed ride-hailing companies to continue using their own background check systems." [...] Instead, Uber and other ride sharing companies would have to convert <b>to</b> <b>fingerprint</b> scanning, which is far more expensive and even less effective according to some. Uber [...] "argues that the fingerprint databases are often out of date and biased against minorities who have been fingerprinted but never charged with a crime." ...|$|E

The simple decoder built against the interleaving attack is further shown to achieve the simple capacity for unknown attacks, and is argued to be an improved and more natural choice than the recently proposed decoder of Oosterwijk et al. With this new simple decoder, cut-offs on the bias distribution function can finally be dismissed. Besides the application of these results <b>to</b> <b>fingerprinting,</b> a direct consequence of our results to group testing is that (i) a simple decoder asymptotically requires a factor 1. 44 more tests to find all defectives than a joint decoder, and (ii) the simple decoder presented in this paper achieves this bound...|$|R
