5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons {{than the number of}} protons in nuclei, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|The third method, time-average holography, {{involves}} {{creating a}} holograph while <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{subjected to a}} periodic stress or vibration. This yields a visual image of the vibration pattern.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} on October 23, 2013 by Catalina Sky Survey, in Arizona in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>object,</b> {{that had an}} asteroid-like appearance but a comet-like orbit, was named 2013 UQ4. On May 7, 2014, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> spotted by astronomers A. Novichonok and T. Prystavski with a fuzzy, coma-like aspect, revealing it was indeed a comet (with total brightness 13.5 mag and coma diameter of 1.5'). <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> then given a comet designation of C/2013 UQ4 (Catalina).|$|R
5|$|Bubbles is an arcade {{video game}} {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. The player uses a joystick {{to control a}} bubble in a kitchen sink. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> to progress through levels by cleaning the sink while avoiding enemies. The game received a mixed reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Double- and multi- {{exposure}} holography is one {{of three}} methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.|$|E
50|$|This {{category}} {{contains an}} odd mixture of <b>objects.</b> Two of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> edge-on disk galaxies with smaller companion galaxies nearby. Two of <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> connected by tidal bridges. <b>The</b> last two <b>objects</b> may simply <b>be</b> interacting {{with each other}} over long distance.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> viewed individually, {{without taking}} other {{documents}} {{as a reference}} and participants did not move objects to compare one to another. <b>The</b> <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> not displayed in the numeric order (1 – 17, as in Table  2), but were arranged randomly.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> possessed <b>object</b> <b>is</b> masculine, <b>the</b> clitic is i. If <b>the</b> possessed <b>object</b> <b>is</b> feminine, <b>the</b> clitic is e. If <b>the</b> possessed <b>object</b> <b>is</b> plural, <b>the</b> clitic is e {{regardless}} of the gender.|$|R
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Atari Inc. {{released}} {{their version}} of Namco's hit arcade game Pac-Man for its Atari 2600 video game console. Like the original arcade version, the player controls the title character with a joystick. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> to traverse a maze, consuming all the wafers within while avoiding four ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{texts are}} {{conventionally}} known {{by a single}} uppercase letter and a name, such as Tablet C, the Mamari Tablet. The somewhat variable names may be descriptive or indicate where <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> kept, as in the Oar, the Snuffbox, the Small Santiago Tablet, and the Santiago Staff.|$|E
30|$|In the {{proposed}} method, we first detect <b>the</b> <b>object</b> to <b>be</b> grasped. <b>The</b> area (BB) and {{the category of}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>are</b> detected. In this paper, we detect <b>the</b> <b>object</b> using Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [9].|$|R
30|$|We {{continue}} to query the left (right) parallel {{line of the}} region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> and search <b>the</b> parent node of the found right (left) parallel line. If the right parallel line is the left child, and the region where <b>the</b> query <b>object</b> <b>is</b> does not have left adjacent parallel line, then the neighbor region of <b>the</b> queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and <b>the</b> right parallel line. If the right parallel line is the right child, and the parent node parallel line is the left parallel line of the region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> then <b>the</b> neighbor region of <b>the</b> queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and <b>the</b> left and right parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the left child, and the parent node parallel line is the right parallel line of the region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> then <b>the</b> neighbor region of <b>the</b> queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and <b>the</b> left and right parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the right child, we use the middle order traversal algorithm {{to search for the}} direct stepfather node of the region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> and <b>the</b> parallel line of the direct stepfather node is the right parallel line of the region where <b>the</b> queried <b>object</b> <b>is.</b> We calculate <b>the</b> distance between <b>the</b> data <b>objects</b> in <b>the</b> above searched region and <b>the</b> queried <b>object,</b> sorting and inserting these data <b>objects</b> into <b>the</b> sorting queue.|$|R
50|$|Henize 2-10 draws {{its name}} from a catalog of {{planetary}} nebulae assembled by astronomer Karl Henize. Henize additionally noted that <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> identified in an unpublished paper by Rudolph Minkowski. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> likely misidentified as a planetary nebula due to the galaxy's strong emission lines, a feature common of planetary nebulae.|$|R
5|$|Joust is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While {{not the first}} game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.|$|E
5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{so hard that}} even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers ghosts and poltergeists have been common {{in the area for}} decades. A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{created by}} a {{constructor}} of the class, <b>the</b> resulting <b>object</b> <b>is</b> called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>are</b> called instance variables, to contrast with the class variables shared across the class.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{unidentified}} <b>objects</b> over <b>the</b> airports of Helsinki, Pulkovo and Peski {{were not}} detected by the airport radars. Although, according to UPI, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> detected by <b>the</b> Helsinki airport radar, the airport's traffic controller Ari Hämäläinen claimed it <b>was</b> not. <b>The</b> <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> not spotted by the Soviet air defense system either. Later, however, <b>the</b> glowing <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> reportedly detected by the weather radar of Karelian Hydrometeorological Observatory in Petrozavodsk on 30 September at 17:40, 20 October at 23:30 and 20 November at 02:14-02:17.|$|R

5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on {{the distance that}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group of}} athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if its orbit is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its small}} size and {{location}} {{away from the}} plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing. Although {{it has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> an ejected supermassive black hole, the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>is</b> to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
40|$|Using {{virtual reality}} {{techniques}} {{we created a}} virtual room within which participants could orient themselves {{by means of a}} head-mounted display. Participants were required to search for a nonimmediately visually available object attached to different parts of the virtual room's walls.

The time taken by participants to initiate the search and to engage <b>the</b> target <b>object</b> <b>was</b> measured. Results from three experiments suggest that (1) advantages in starting the search, finding, and engaging <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>were</b> found when <b>the</b> <b>object</b> emitted both light and sound; (2) these advantages disappeared when the visual and auditory information emitted by <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>was</b> separated in time by more than 150 ms; (3) misleading visual information determined a greater level of interference than misleading auditory information (e. g., sound from one part of the room, light from <b>the</b> <b>object)</b> ...|$|R
