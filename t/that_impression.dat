In the southern states of Tennessee and Georgia, Whig strongholds in the 1840 general election, voter support dropped precipitously due to the pro-annexation excitement in the Deep South – and Clay lost every Deep South state to Polk. Northern Whigs' uncompromising hostility to slavery expansion increasingly characterized the party, and southern members, by association, had suffered from charges of being [...] "soft on Texas, therefore soft on slavery" [...] by Southern Democrats.

500|$|Goffman does {{break from}} his {{connection}} with George Herbert Mead and Herbert Blumer in {{that while he}} does not reject {{the way in which}} individuals perceive themselves, he was more interested in the actual physical proximity or the “interaction order” that molds the self (481). In other words, Goffman believed <b>that</b> <b>impression</b> management can only be achieved if the audience is in sync with the individual’s perception of self. If the audience is in disagreement with the image an individual is presenting then the individual’s presentation of self is interrupted. Individuals present images of themselves based on how society thinks they should act in a particular situation. This decision on how to act is decided based on the concept of definition of the situation. The definition are all predetermined and individuals choose how they will act by choosing the proper behavior for the social situation they are in. Goffman draws from William Thomas for this concept as well. Thomas believed that people are born into a particular social class and so the definitions of the situations that they [...] will encounter have been previously defined for them (480). For instance when an individual from a high class background goes to a black tie affair the predefined definition of situation would be that they must mind their manners and act according to their class.|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates <b>that</b> <b>impression.</b> That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

Massey portrayed Brown again in the little-known, low-budget Seven Angry Men, in which he was not only the main character, but depicted in a much more restrained, sympathetic way. Massey along with Tyrone Power and Judith Anderson starred in the acclaimed 1953 dramatic reading of Stephen Vincent Benet's epic Pulitzer Prize-winning poem John Brown's Body(1928). Three actors in formal dress recited and acted in a two-hour presentation of the poem. The production toured 60 cities in 28 states.|$|E
