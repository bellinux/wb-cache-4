5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who would take care of <b>things?</b> <b>The</b> <b>way</b> in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E
25|$|In Eclipse, Bella {{agrees to}} marry Edward on the {{condition}} he will make love to her while she is still human. Edward eventually relents and agrees, on the stipulation it will only occur after they are married. The plot {{is driven by the}} machinations of the vampire Victoria, who, seeking revenge for the death of her mate James, is hunting Bella and creating new vampires to build an army. A grudging truce is made between the Cullens and the Native-American werewolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, a friend of Bella's who was there for her when Edward broke her heart. However, the truce is endangered when Bella realizes Jacob means more to her than she thought. Ultimately, Edward accepts that Bella cares for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria, and Bella acknowledges that Edward is {{the most important person in}} her life. Edward tells Bella that they may attempt making love before they get married, as he realizes that she spends too much of her life trying to please other people. However, she refuses his offer and agrees to doing <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Edward initially wanted: marriage, making love, and then becoming a vampire.|$|E

500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around {{because it was too}} much hassle... It was another creative limitation... If I were in my studio, I would have done <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I normally do them. But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content to just keep doing <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they have been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to grab hold of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E
500|$|Daltrey spotted Entwistle {{by chance}} {{on the street}} {{carrying}} a bass and recruited him into the Detours. In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist, Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals. [...] The band played instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, {{and a variety of}} pop and trad jazz covers. Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, [...] "ran <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he wanted them". Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by Doug Sandom, though he was older {{than the rest of the}} band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.|$|E

500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he does." ...|$|E
500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that [...] "as long as we do <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E
500|$|Salander is a {{computer}} hacker who has survived severe emotional and sexual abuse. The character was a [...] "vulnerable victim-turned-vigilante with the [...] "take-no-prisoners" [...] attitude of Lara Croft and the [...] "cool, unsentimental intellect" [...] of Spock. Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling, and stated, [...] "there's a kind of wish fulfillment {{to her in the}} way that she takes care of <b>things,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well." [...] Casting was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Natalie Portman, Ellen Page, Kristen Stewart, Emily Browning, Jennifer Lawrence, Keira Knightley, Anne Hathaway, Olivia Thirlby, Scarlett Johansson, and Emma Watson. Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay. Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film The Social Network. Fincher, while fond of the actress' youthful appearance, found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander's antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the submissive Erica. Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander. Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the appearance that she cut it herself. In addition to her transgressive appearance, which was described as a [...] "mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth with a dash of S temptress" [...] by Lynn Hirschberg of W, Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.|$|E

They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all.

Using just about {{everything}} in his arsenal to keep Andy Souwer off-balance {{and out of his}} range, Petrosyan was seemingly in control of the exchanges. However, the fight got dramatic when the judges unexpectedly ruled it a draw after three rounds, sending the fight into an extension round to decide the winner. Things got even more heated when Souwer was dropped by a punch in the extension round and referee Joop Ubeda declined to give him a count. In the end, the judges saw <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the Italian and gave him the unanimous decision, in what was considered a major upset.|$|E

2500|$|The {{march of}} the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly {{emphasizing}} a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain {{within the bounds of}} the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV [...] pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness. [...] As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: [...] "There is no alphabet here. So if you're expecting one nation to follow another, the way they generally do at an opening ceremony, think again." [...] Matt Lauer added [...] "You're out of luck.

2500|$|In late 1961, Entwistle {{joined the}} Detours, a skiffle/rock and roll band, led by Roger Daltrey. The new bass player then {{suggested}} Townshend to join {{as an additional}} guitarist. In {{the early days of}} the Detours, the band's repertoire consisted of instrumentals by the Shadows and the Ventures, as well as pop and trad jazz covers. Their line-up coalesced around Roger Daltrey on lead guitar, Townshend on rhythm guitar, Entwistle on bass, Doug Sandom on drums and Colin Dawson as vocalist. Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and, according to Townshend, [...] "ran <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he wanted them." [...] Dawson quit in 1962 after arguing too much with Daltrey, who subsequently moved to lead vocalist. As a result, Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce, who started booking the band as a support act for bands like Screaming Lord Sutch, Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates. In 1963, Townshend's father arranged an amateur recording of [...] "It Was You", the first song his son ever wrote. The Detours became aware of a group of the same name in February 1964, forcing them to change their name. Townshend's roommate Richard Barnes came up with [...] "The Who", and Daltrey decided it was the best choice.|$|E
