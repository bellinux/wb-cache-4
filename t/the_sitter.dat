5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). <b>The</b> <b>sitter</b> for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> was a private person. Although his family worried about caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E

5000|$|An {{experiment}} {{conducted by}} the British Psychological Society in 2005 suggests that under the controlled condition of the experiment, people {{who claimed to be}} professional mediums do not demonstrate the mediumistic ability. In the experiment, mediums were assigned to work the participants chosen to be [...] "sitters." [...] The mediums claimed to contact the deceased who were related to <b>the</b> <b>sitters.</b> <b>The</b> research gather the numbers of the statements made and have <b>the</b> <b>sitters</b> rate <b>the</b> accuracy of the statements. The readings that were considered to be somewhat accurate by <b>the</b> <b>sitters</b> were very generalized, and the ones that were considered inaccurate were the ones that were very specific.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sitter</b> is unknown, {{although}} some art historians have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{assigned}} Lisa's name to {{at least}} four different paintings and her identity {{to at least}} ten different people. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in more than 300 other paintings and in 2,000advertisements, appearing at an average of one new advertisement each week. In 2005, an expert at the University Library of Heidelberg discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> was Lisa. The note, written by Agostino Vespucci in 1503, states that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. The Mona Lisa has been in custody of France since the 16th century, when it was acquired by King Francis I; after the French Revolution, however, it came into the possession of the people. Today about six million people visit the painting each year at the Louvre in Paris, where {{it is part of a}} French national collection.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} <b>the</b> <b>sitter.</b> The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E

60|$|The {{final version}} of this brief but {{laborious}} score has been preserved, and all the stages in its progress have been abundantly annotated. To follow it through in detail, however, would be but weariness. All the salient points in its production fall under one of three heads. There are, first, the passages {{that seem to have}} been produced in co-operation with <b>the</b> <b>sitters.</b> There are, second, the passages that seem to have been produced in independence of <b>the</b> <b>sitters.</b> And there are, third, the passages that seem to have been produced in direct opposition to <b>the</b> <b>sitters.</b> Examples of all three classes follow; perhaps only those of the third and last class are really important.|$|R
50|$|Each Ajah {{has three}} Sitters. Sitters are highly esteemed sisters {{who have been}} chosen within their Ajah to {{represent}} their Ajah and its interests in the Hall of the Tower. Typically, the leader or head of the Ajah is not a <b>Sitter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sitters</b> often jealously defend the Hall's power, and an Amyrlin's reign is often judged by how well she manages to keep <b>the</b> <b>Sitters</b> under her control.|$|R
5|$|The woman, who is {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes {{to focus attention on}} <b>the</b> <b>sitter.</b> It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that the}} angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E
25|$|In 1626, van der Hamen painted {{cardinal}} Francesco Barberini, after {{a previous}} portrait by Velázquez {{had failed to}} please <b>the</b> <b>sitter.</b> Well satisfied with his work Cardinal Barberini acquired three further works from him.|$|E
25|$|During the 1770s and 1780s Gainsborough {{developed}} {{a type of}} portrait in which he integrated <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> into the landscape. A splendid {{example of this is}} his portrait of Frances Browne, Mrs John Douglas (1746-1811) which can be seen at Waddesdon Manor. <b>The</b> <b>sitter</b> has withdrawn to a secluded and overgrown corner of a garden to read a letter, her pose recalling the traditional representation of Melancholy. Gainsborough emphasised the relationship between Mrs Douglas and her environment by painting the clouds behind her and the drapery billowing across her lap with similar silvery mauves and fluid brushstrokes. This portrait was included in his first private exhibition at Schomberg House in 1784.|$|E

40|$|The {{conformal}} {{structure of}} <b>the</b> Schwarzschild-de <b>Sitter</b> spacetime is analysed using the extended conformal Einstein field equations. To this end, initial data for an asymptotic initial value problem for <b>the</b> Schwarzschild-de <b>Sitter</b> spacetime is obtained. This initial data allows {{to understand the}} singular behaviour of the conformal structure at the asymptotic points where the horizons of <b>the</b> Schwarzschild-de <b>Sitter</b> spacetime meet <b>the</b> conformal boundary. Using the insights gained from the analysis of <b>the</b> Schwarzschild-de <b>Sitter</b> spacetime in a conformal Gaussian gauge, we consider nonlinear perturbations close to <b>the</b> Schwarzschild- de <b>Sitter</b> spacetime in <b>the</b> asymptotic region. We show that small enough perturbations of asymptotic initial data for the Schwarzschild de-Sitter spacetime {{give rise to a}} solution to the Einstein field equations which exists to the future and has an asymptotic structure similar to that of <b>the</b> Schwarzschild-de <b>Sitter</b> spacetime.

25|$|As {{in many of}} Leonardo's paintings, the {{composition}} comprises a pyramidic spiral and <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> is caught in the motion of turning to her left, reflecting Leonardo's lifelong preoccupation with the dynamics of movement. The three-quarter profile portrait {{was one of his}} many innovations. Il Moro's court poet, Bernardo Bellincioni, was the first to propose that Cecilia is poised as if listening to an unseen speaker.|$|E
25|$|Vasari's {{account of}} the Mona Lisa comes from his {{biography}} of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death.

25|$|La Femme aux Phlox is an oil {{on canvas}} with {{dimensions}} 81 x 100cm (31 by 39 inches) signed and dated 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created {{during the second half}} of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with a vase of flowers (phloxes) in front and another to her left. The window behind <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> opens out onto an exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.|$|E
25|$|Man in a Hammock {{integrates}} the {{man into}} the landscape, forming a single image {{by virtue of}} a non-linear grid. This device is used by Gleizes very skillfully to accommodate {{all aspects of the}} scene. Mercereau's book, the still-life next to <b>the</b> <b>sitter,</b> the man, and the environment are all symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects (a guitar, violin, or a bowl of fruit).|$|E
25|$|In {{this picture}} Gleizes merges <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> with the environment, {{blurring}} {{the distinction between}} background and foreground. In addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective, the artist has included {{the image of a}} clock in the upper left quadrant (as in Metzinger's Nu à la cheminée, Nude of 1910), a fact that reveals Gleizes' didactic visual and literary reference to the mathematician and philosopher of science Henri Poincaré, and to the philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of 'duration'.|$|E

5000|$|He is {{credited}} with introducing {{a new kind of}} portrait genre in Flanders: small-scale group portraits in which the subjects are depicted going about their everyday activities in their houses or gardens. [...] These portraits were narrative in nature rather than genre pieces. [...] From his early tentative compositions he developed later the ability to put together well-organized and complex scenes. [...] The portraits had their roots in aristocratic portraiture and aimed to stress the status and privilege of <b>the</b> <b>sitters.</b> To this end <b>the</b> <b>sitters</b> were depicted in scenes that emphasized the spiritual and material achievements of <b>the</b> <b>sitters</b> such as musical performances, outdoor meals, quiet strolls and hunting scenes. He integrated Venetian motifs such as classical architecture and drapery in the compositions, as had been pioneered by van Dyck.|$|R

25|$|A {{painting}} by Gleizes entitled Man in a Hammock integrates the man into the landscape, forming a single image {{by virtue of}} a non-linear grid. This device is used by Gleizes to accommodate {{all aspects of the}} scene. One of Mercereau's books {{can be seen in the}} painting, along with the still-life next to <b>the</b> <b>sitter,</b> the man, and the environment. All are symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{depicting}} the Man with Pipe from {{one point of}} view, Metzinger uses the concept he developed in 1910 of 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject {{from a variety of}} angles. The sitter’s face, clothes, hat are observed from a succession of spatial angles or locations captured {{over an extended period of}} time, resulting in a complex series of profile and frontal views seen simultaneously. The chairs, table and objects place on it, are seen from entirely different angles from <b>the</b> <b>sitter.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the face}} of <b>the</b> <b>sitter</b> is treated with natural colors, {{the rest of the}} canvas appears treated with more {{artificial}} tints, tones, hues and shades. Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck or Kees van Dongen, Metzinger's composition is strongly Cézannian. The vertical format and background structure creates a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of Cézanne's 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence. However, the brushstrokes and overall appearance are not at all Cézannian or Fauve in nature.|$|E

It is unstable under small perturbations which may cause a breakdown of <b>the</b> de <b>Sitter</b> symmetry. <b>The</b> de <b>Sitter</b> string sigma model is discussed. It is argued that the gauge theory at the complex coupling is dual to the matrix elements of vertex operators in <b>the</b> de <b>Sitter</b> space, taken between the Bunch - Davies vacuum and the "out" state without particles. The described infrared effects are likely to screen away the cosmological constant. Comment: 27 pages important comments added. references adde...|$|R
