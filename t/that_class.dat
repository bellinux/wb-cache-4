In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews.

5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class.

Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in <b>that</b> <b>class</b> are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with <b>that</b> <b>class</b> determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E

5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that <b>that</b> <b>class</b> of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

40|$|We present {{generalization}} of the Bloom variety theorem of ordered algebras in fuzzy setting.

In this setting, we show <b>that</b> <b>classes</b> of models of fuzzy sets of inequalities are closed under suitably defined formations of subalgebras, homomorphic images, and direct products.

5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of {{feminism}} {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have inspired {{a number of different}} (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe <b>that</b> <b>class</b> struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} design {{work for the}} new mixed-traffic locomotives was undertaken at Brighton railway works where they were scheduled to be constructed. The earliest drawings were for a moderately sized 2-6-0 with similarities to the London and North Eastern Railway K4class, which Bulleid had helped design for the West Highland Line when he was Nigel Gresley's assistant. However, such a design would have been inadequate for the Kent Coast lines, which required a powerful 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 class. It is not clear why the design was subsequently enlarged to become a smaller version of the Merchant Navy class 4-6-2 as the likely traffic requirement did not warrant such lavish provision, but the incorporation of components from <b>that</b> <b>class</b> enabled standardisation during wartime production difficulties.|$|E
5000|$|The paradoxes of naive {{set theory}} can be {{explained}} in terms of the inconsistent assumption <b>that</b> [...] "all <b>classes</b> are sets". With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest proofs <b>that</b> certain <b>classes</b> are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, Russell's paradox suggests a proof <b>that</b> the <b>class</b> of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the Burali-Forti paradox suggests <b>that</b> the <b>class</b> of all ordinal numbers is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all <b>classes</b> <b>that</b> do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes.|$|R
