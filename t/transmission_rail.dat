40|$|In {{waveguide}} structures, waves may {{be partially}} reflected by local non-uniformities such as cracks and other defects. The reflection and transmission characteristics {{associated with the}} presence of a discontinuity may be used, in principle, to give some indication of both the location and size of the defect. A combined spectral element and finite element (SE/FE) method has been used previously to investigate the effects of local non-uniformities at relatively low frequencies. However, for analysis at higher frequencies, where complex deformation of the waveguide occurs, it is necessary to extend this approach. Such high frequency analysis is necessary if small defects are to be located within the waveguide cross-section. In order to investigate wave propagation at higher frequencies, a combined spectral super element and finite element (SSE/FE) method is presented. This method allows the transmission, reflection and wave conversion at discontinuities to be determined for complex waveguides. As an example of the use of this method, wave reflection and <b>transmission</b> in <b>rails</b> are estimated at frequencies between 20 and 40 kHz for various notional sawcut-like defects of progressively increasing size. This shows the feasibility of the approach for realistic waveguides. However, from these simulations it is shown that defects have to be quite large before they can be detected using a single transducer position on the rail cross-section using train-induced vibratio...|$|R
2500|$|The super-speed Transrapid maglev {{system has}} no wheels, no axles, no gear <b>transmissions,</b> no steel <b>rails,</b> and no {{overhead}} electrical pantographs. The maglev vehicles do not roll on wheels; rather, they hover above the track guideway, using the attractive magnetic force between two linear arrays of electromagnetic coils—one {{side of the}} coil on the vehicle, the other side in the track guideway, which function together as a magnetic dipole. During levitation and travelling operation, the Transrapid maglev vehicle floats on a frictionless magnetic cushion with no physical contact whatsoever with the track guideway. On-board vehicle electronic systems measure the dipole gap distance 100,000 times per second to guarantee the clearance between the coils attached to {{the underside of the}} guideway and the magnetic portion of the vehicle wrapped around the guideway edges.

40|$|This paper {{compared}} {{the performance of}} several isolation designs to control vibration <b>transmissions</b> from concrete <b>rail</b> viaducts. The isolation systems analysed includes medium- and short-length floating slabs, and floating ladders. The vibration was measured in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong. The study aimed to assess the effects of bending resonances of the floating slab systems. Simple formulae of estimating the significant bending resonance frequency and support passage frequency of a floating slab system are proposed. The resonance peaks obtained in site measurement {{are found to be}} in agreement with the calculation results. The results show that other than the vertical rigid body resonances for the isolation systems, the bending resonances of slabs have significant effects on vibration isolation performance. In particular, bending resonance frequencies should not coincide with the vertical isolator resonance and support passage frequency. According to the in-situ measurement results, a mini-type concrete floating slab can reduce the vibration level by more than 30 dB in the frequency range of 63 - 200 Hz. This should be achieved by designing the first bending resonances of the floating slab {{to be out of the}} dominant frequency range of concrete rail viaduct vibration.

40|$|Background: Chronic mild stress (CMS) {{has been}} {{reported}} to induce behavioral abnormalities that model human depression. To investigate the role in depression of phasic dopamine transmission in cortical and limbic areas, we studied the effect of CMS on the responsiveness of dopamine (DA) transmission to aversive and rewarding stimuli in rats by microdialysis of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFCX). Methods: Rats were subjected for 30 days to CMS and administered two trials of tail pinch as aversive stimulus and two feeding sessions of a highly palatable food as rewarding stimulus. Concentric microdialysis probes were implanted in the NAc shell and in the medial PFCX. Results: In unstressed rats, DA decreased in the NAc and increased in the PFCX on the first tail-pinch trial; on the 1 (st) feeding trial DA increased in the NAc and to a larger extent in the PFCX. In the second tail-pinch trial or feeding trial, these responses were maintained in the PFCX but underwent habituation in the NAc. CMS did not affect basal dialysate DA in the NAc or in the PFCX bur infleunced the responsiveness of DA <b>transmission</b> to <b>rail</b> pinches and to feeding in a reciprocal manner. Thus, in the tail-pinch trial, CMS reversed the inhibitory response of NAc DA transmission into a stimulatory one and potentiated the stimulatory response in the PFCX. By contrast, in the feeding trial, CMS blunted the stimulatory response of DA transmission in the NAc in the first trial and in the PFCX in the second trial. Conclusions: CMS reciprocally affected DA responsiveness to motivational stimuli, facilitating or inducing a stimulatory DA response to aversive stimuli but blunting stimulatory responses to rewarding stimuli. Given the postulated role of phasic DA responsiveness in the NAc shell for learning and of DA transmission in the PFCX for expression of motivation, we hypothesize that depression is the result of defective learning and expression of motivation. aversive and appetitive motivatio...|$|R
30|$|According to a model {{proposed}} by Remington and Witting [46], {{the generation of}} bridge-borne noise {{can be divided into}} three steps: first, as the train passes, the wheel–rail interaction causes the rail and wheel to vibrate; second, the vibratory energy is then transmitted to the bridge structure through the rail fastening, causing various structural components of the bridge to vibrate; and third, the vibrating bridge components, rails, and wheels then radiate sound. This model used the combined wheel–rail roughness as the external excitation. Once the total power input of the bridge was calculated, the distribution of power throughout the bridge structure was determined using simple SEA. Finally, the total sound power radiated by the bridge was calculated using the radiation efficiency of each component. Because this model only accounted for the rail’s vertical bending and traveling wave, no wave <b>transmission</b> in the <b>rail</b> was modeled at frequencies below the decoupling one, which is not reasonable. Remington and Witting then compared the noise radiated by an open-deck viaduct with and without rail fastenings; the measured noise levels were compared with the ones computed by the above model. According to the theoretical calculation, the noise level would be reduced by 2  dB(A) after installing elastic rail fastenings; the actual reduction was 4  dB(A), indicating that the computed results were reasonable. The theoretical model was used further to investigate the effectiveness of several noise reduction measures, and elastic rail fastenings were shown to be the most effective (maximum noise reduction: 10  dB(A)).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of installing a double-circuit gas insulated transmission line (GIL) in the pilot tunnel of the new planned railway galleries Fortezza–Innsbruck. The high GIL power ratings with very low power losses would allow a strong and highly efficient energy exchange particularly useful for the future European Market and could represent a new fundamental step in reconstructing the European interconnection network. Two separate railway tunnels (9. 6 m) will run under the Brenner Pass from Fortezza (Italy) to Innsbruck (Austria) but will be preceded by the construction of a continuous pilot tunnel (4. 3 m) useful for work logistics and chiefly for detection of the rock stratigraphy. Once the whole work will be over, the pilot tunnel will be used as a service gallery (drainage of water) where a double-circuit GIL can efficiently be installed. The paper gives the main characteristics of planned galleries, several details on the transmission line and its performance, the electro-magnetic field impact considering the proximity effects and the earthing arrangement in order to zero the touch-voltages in case of phase-to-enclosure short-circuits. The chief features of GIL solution are the lowest transmission power losses and the absence of shunt reactive compensation for this line length (appr. 65 km) but mostly the safety of personnel in case of short-circuit and the possibility of usual re-closure cycles for operation continuity. This paper gives an overview of other analysis: GIL no-load regime, electromagnetic interferences between railway and GIL system, pilot tunnel ventilation and GIL thermal regime. In order to achieve satisfying power flows, the new link requires both Italian=Austrian regional grids (380 kV- 110 kV) to be restructured and rationalized.
