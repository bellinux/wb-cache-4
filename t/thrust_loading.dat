50|$|Engineers {{can use the}} Brinell {{hardness}} {{of materials}} in their calculations to avoid this mode of failure. A rolling element bearing's static load rating is defined to avoid this failure type. Increasing the number of elements can provide better distribution of the load, so bearings intended for a large load may have many balls, or use needles instead. This decreases the chances of brinelling, but increases friction and other factors. However, although roller and ball bearings work well for radial and <b>thrust</b> <b>loading,</b> they are often prone to brinelling when very high impact loading, lateral loading, or vibration are experienced. Babbitt bearings or bronze bushings are often used instead of roller bearings in applications where such loads exist, such as in automotive crankshafts or pulley sheaves, to decrease the possibility of brinelling by distributing the force over a very large surface area.|$|E
5000|$|This 368’ (112m) long steel {{stressed}} ribbon/arch combination {{bridge is}} {{the first of its kind}} in North America. A steel arch with a span of 163’ (49.5m) supports steel stress ribbons and precast concrete planks over the river complementing the adjacent historic Lancaster Avenue vehicular bridge. The arch spans the entire river and the steel stress ribbons rest upon the arch. The minimal sag profile of the stressed ribbons creates major tension loads which are balanced against the <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> in the opposite direction caused by the steel arch. The balancing of these opposing loads minimizes the required size of the foundations. Pre-fabricated concrete planks have been anchored directly to the steel stress ribbons to form the bridge walkway, eliminating the need for temporary scaffolding in the river and on the adjacent shorelines. The absence of vertical support struts reduces horizontal loads created by periodic river flooding. At night, the bridge is illuminated by a combination of white and blue LED lights.|$|E

The longitudinal separation of rudder and propeller was varied, and by extending the span of the rectangular rudder an insight into the influence of propeller diameter/rudder span was provided. Results are presented for each rudder as lift and drag coefficients and centre of pressure for selected angles of attack and changes in propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>loading.</b> Surface pressure distributions over the rudder were also obtained in order to provide a detailed knowledge of the distribution of forces over the rudder. The results demonstrate the controlling influence of propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> on basic rudder forces and on the movement of rudder centre of pressure.

The propeller characteristics were obtained for a range of power coefficients from 0. 30 to 1. 00 at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 40 and 0. 50. The results of the force measurements are indicative only of trends in propeller efficiency with changes in power coefficient and advance-diameter ratio because unknown interference effects existed during the investigation. At a free-stream Mach number of 0. 40, the envelopes of the efficiency curves decreased about 11 % between advance-diameter ratios of 2. 40 and 4. 40. An increase in power coefficient from 0. 30 to 0. 80 at an advance-diameter ratio of 2. 40 had little effect on the propeller efficiency. A change in power coefficient from 0. 40 to 1. 00 at an advance-diameter ratio of 4. 40 increased the propeller efficiency by about 40 %. For conditions below the stall the <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> on the outboard blade sections increased more rapidly than on the inboard sections as the power coefficient was increased or as the advance-diameter ratio was decreased.

40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of an investigation}} into the flow straightening effects on a ship rudder of an upstram propeller and hull. In order to quantify these effects an experimental investigation was carried out using a 3. 5 m x 2. 5 m wind tunnel. The tests were carried out with an all-movable rudder and a representative propeller for drift angles up to ± 15 °. Three different lengths of centreboards were tested upstream of the rudder-propeller combination, together with a representative hull. Flow straightening effects were found to be dependent on the type of upstream body, drift angle and propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>loading.</b> The effects of the three centreboards upstream of the propeller were found to be significantly greater than the effect of the propeller on its own. The straightening effects of the hull were found to be less than those for the centreline boards. There was an increase in flow straightening with increase in propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> at a drift angle of 15 ° but at 7. 5 ° drift this effect was less apparent and sometimes reversed. The overall results provide a better understanding of flow straightening effects and data for improving the prediction of manoeuvring rudder forces.

40|$|Sedimentological and {{structural}} data from Pennsylvanian-Permian synorogenic deposits of the Central Colorado trough {{provide an opportunity}} {{to examine the relationship between}} deformation and sedimentation in an Ancestral Rocky Mountain basin. The Central Colorado trough was a north-south trending basin bordered by basement-involved highlands of the Uncompahgre Uplift on the west, and the Ancestral Front Range and Apishapa Uplifts on the east. Measured section data show that the Central Colorado trough was an asymmetric basin, with up to 4, 000 m of coarse-grained deposits adjacent to the Sand Creek-Crestone thrust system of the Uncompahgre Uplift. These deposits pinch out eastward against the Apishapa Uplift along the eastern basin margin. Lithofacies analysis shows that the Central Colorado trough was filled by fan delta, fluvial delta, and turbidite deposits of the Minturn Formation and alluvial fan, braided stream, and meandering stream deposits of the Sangre de Cristo Formation. Relative sea level fluctuation resulted in well-developed cyclicity in the deposits of the Minturn Formation. Geologic mapping has identified three syndepositional structures in the Central Colorado trough that all indicate Pennsylvanian-Permian contractile deformation. These structures include the Gibson Peak growth syncline in the footwall of the Crestone thrust fault, the Sand Creek blind thrust fault buried beneath Pennsylvanian-Permian deposits, and the Badger Creek intraformational angular unconformity. ^ Results of this study suggest that the Central Colorado trough formed due to <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> from the Crestone and Sand Creek faults. The Apishapa Uplift is interpreted as a forebulge that formed in response to <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> along the western basin margin.

The Paradox basin, Eagle basin, and Denver embayment were asymmetric basins with synorogenic deposits concentrated adjacent to basin-bounding thrust faults and reverse faults, suggesting a regional pattern of contractile deformation. ...|$|E

When using heterogeneous rheology, the program calculates the flexural behavior as a function of crus-tal geometry and thermal regime of the lithosphere, thus relating the basin infill geometry with the deep lithosphere properties.

40|$|Abstract: The Basal Unit of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex {{preserves}} {{evidence of}} a protracted deformation and accretion history. The earliest recognizable events record the construction of ocean crust and the generation of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex in a slow-spreading ridge-axis environment. The initial stages of deformation involved {{the development of a}} sub-horizontal crustal-scale shear zone and its progressive deformation by ductile thrusting and folding. Subsequent deformation progressed with the out-of-sequence stacking of ocean lithosphere in which detachment, initiated at mid-crustal levels, culminated in mantle decoupling as thrust slices were derived from progressively deeper crustal levels. The progressive emplacement of a coherent slice of ocean lithosphere over previously accreted units and the generation of a dynamothermal aureole are consistent with models suggesting rapid overthrusting of young ocean lithosphere. Evidence from the dynamothermal aureole indicates that syn-emplacement extensional collapse of the complex occurred in response to <b>thrust</b> <b>loading.</b> Foreland-directed oVsliding and lateral thrusting mark the final stages in the collapse of the complex...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation has}} been carried out into the interaction between a ship rudder and propeller combination. The tests used the 11 ' x 8 ' low speed wind tunnel at the University of Southampton. This report presents results for a series of three all-movable rudders with the same mean chord of 667 mm and NACA 0020 sections, but with varying aspect ratio and taper ratio. A four-bladed, 800 mm diameter, adjustable pitch propeller was used. This propeller is {{a modified version of the}} Wageningen B 4. 40 series. Open-water results for the modified design were validated against published data. The test consisted of a series of parametric studies into the effect of the longitudinal distance between the propeller and rudder, propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>loading,</b> rudder aspect ratio, and rudder taper ratio. A five-component strain-gauge dynamometer was used to measure lift, drag and three moments on the rudder and a rotating strain gauge dynamometer the developed thrust and torque of the propeller. In addition, both spanwise and chordwise pressure distributions were measured on the rudder surface. Propeller revolutions were varied between 0 and 3, 000 rpm and tunnel wind speeds up to 20 m/s were used. Results are presented in the form of non-dimensional coefficients of lift (C subscript L), drag (C subscript D), spanwise (CP subscript S) and chordwise (CP subscript C) position of the centre of pressure variation with incidence for the rudder. The influence of rudder on propeller performance is given in terms of non-dimensional thrust (K subscript T) and torque (K subscript Q) coefficient variation with advance ratio (J). The surface pressure measurements on the rudder are presented as both a spanwise distribution of the local lift coefficient (C subscript L) and as a surface pressure distribution. Principal findings of the work were that: increasing propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>loading</b> increased rudder sideforce while delaying stall. For constant rpm the presence of the rudder alters the propellers developed thrust and torque characteristic. Changes in the longitudinal separation of the rudder and propeller had only a minimal effect on the sideforce characteristics of the rudder.
