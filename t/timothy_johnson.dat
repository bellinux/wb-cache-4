25|$|It is {{generally}} difficult for any scholar {{to construct a}} portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. On the other hand, scholars such as N. T. Wright and Luke <b>Timothy</b> <b>Johnson</b> argue that the image of Jesus presented in the gospels is largely accurate, and that dissenting scholars are simply too cautious about what we can claim to know about the ancient era.|$|E

500|$|<b>Timothy</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{contends that}} Nixon in China goes beyond minimalism in {{important}} ways. [...] Adams had been inspired, in developing his art, by minimalist composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley, {{and this is}} reflected in the work by repetitive rhythmic patterns. [...] However, the opera's complex harmonic structures are very different from the simpler ones in, for example, Glass's Einstein on the Beach, which Adams terms [...] "mindlessly repetitive"; Johnson nevertheless considers the Glass opera an influence on Nixon in China. As Glass's techniques did not allow Adams to accomplish what he wanted, he employed a system of constantly shifting metric organizational schemes to supplement the repeated rhythms in the opera. [...] The music is marked by metrical dissonance, which occurs both for musical reasons and in response to the text of the opera.|$|E

[...] "You can", he continues, [...] "look up almost any writer {{on the subject of}} Jesus and find a brief but fair summary of the person's writing and point of view ... It is a great one stop source of quick summary information."

2500|$|Verhoeven is {{a member}} of the Jesus Seminar, and he is the only member who does not have a degree in biblical studies. He {{graduated}} with a degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Leiden. [...] Since he is not a professional biblical exegete, his membership in the Jesus Seminar has occasionally been cited by opponents of the Seminar as a sign that this group is less scholarly than it claims. For example, Luke <b>Timothy</b> <b>Johnson</b> criticizes the Jesus Seminar's methods on exegetical grounds, and also criticizes what he perceives to be a dependence on the theatrical and an attempt to manipulate the mainstream media. [...] He singles out Verhoeven as a key player in the media activities of the Jesus Seminar. On the other hand, some Jesus Seminar members were unhappy with Verhoeven's portrayal of Jesus as an eschatological prophet.|$|E
