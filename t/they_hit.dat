5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with systems named after places, saints or things <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> before the formal start of naming in the Western Pacific. These included the Kamikaze, 1906 Hong Kong typhoon, 1922 Swatow typhoon and the 1934 Muroto typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} the {{argument}} that the virus helped tip {{the balance of power in}} the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the Allied powers, and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the player.|$|E
50|$|Thus tennis shots can be {{categorized}} according to when <b>they</b> are <b>hit</b> (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how <b>they</b> are <b>hit</b> (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where <b>they</b> are <b>hit</b> (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).|$|R

50|$|Fledgling: Bonca fledglings are mischievous {{creatures that}} may {{deliberately}} attack your structures. <b>They</b> have low <b>hit</b> points, but if <b>they</b> are <b>hit,</b> <b>they</b> start squeling {{and calling for}} adult boncas in the vicinity to protect them. Upon their call, nearby Boncas will charge at the offending armies. Note that once the Fledglings stops crying the bonca will lose interest and run off.|$|R
5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Sir Bobby Robson {{was raised}} {{a few miles}} away from Tow Law, in the village of Langley Park. He had held the title of life {{president}} at the club, and had helped them out when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> financial difficulties after the 2001 foot and mouth crisis, which devastated the local area. He was known {{to spend a lot of}} time on the club, attending fund raisers and giving talks. On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} and switches between them throughout. The first has band members Homme, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan driving a truck at night, whereupon <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> a deer. When they get out to inspect, the deer proceeds to attack them before going on a rampage in their International Harvester Scout. The second section of the video is of Homme, Oliveri, Troy Van Leeuwen and Dave Grohl performing the song against a black background.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is a {{beautiful}} boy, {{and it is a}} great pity; but what IS to happen WILL happen,' said <b>they.</b> <b>'It</b> is written in the books of fate that he must die, either by a crocodile, or a serpent, or by a dog. If we could save him we would; but that is beyond our power.' ...|$|R

If you're talking about Sydney, you're {{talking about a}} {{principal}} income earner who might be earning $50-60 thousand a year, and a secondary income earner, who will be working part-time, and could pull in anywhere between 20 or 30 thousand dollars per year. These are people who work very hard, <b>they</b> are <b>hit</b> by rising inflation, which is why tackling inflation in this Budget is so important, <b>they</b> are <b>hit</b> by {{the rising cost of}} living, and until recent times <b>they</b> have been <b>hit</b> by a rising proportion of taxation...." ...|$|R

5|$|Throughout the song, players receive {{points for}} every note hit, {{and this is}} totalled up and {{displayed}} {{at the end of}} the song, along with a percentage of how many notes <b>they</b> <b>hit,</b> and a rating: 1 to 5 stars. If the score is close to perfect, normally requiring at least 98% of the notes, the rating is five 'gold' stars, instead of the normal bronze. The score is saved and shown alongside the song in the select screen; over time, as the song is replayed, it shows only the highest score.|$|E
5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the track, one {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.|$|E
5|$|Word was {{spreading}} about the band's bizarre stage show {{by the time}} <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the road again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts. Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as Blind Eye Sees All, their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, {{and used it to}} record two songs later used on the A-side of Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis.|$|E

50|$|When {{a player}} is tapped out they {{drop to the}} ground with one knee {{touching}} the ground. If <b>they</b> have been <b>hit</b> by a staff or other pompfe, they stay down for five stones. If <b>they</b> have been <b>hit</b> by a chain, they are down for eight stones. The count begins when the knee hits the ground and while the player may move to retrieve a weapon they must return to where <b>they</b> were <b>hit</b> before <b>they</b> start playing. A kneeling player may also pivot around on their knee provided they don't lift it.|$|R
50|$|Sailors use {{traditional}} nautical {{terms for}} {{the parts of}} or directions on a vessel: starboard (right), port or larboard (left), forward or fore (front), aft or abaft (rearward), bow (forward part of the hull), stern (aft part of the hull), beam (the widest part). Vertical spars are masts, horizontal spars are booms (if <b>they</b> can <b>hit</b> the sailor), yards, gaffs (if they are too high to reach) or poles (if <b>they</b> cannot <b>hit</b> the sailor).|$|R
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{arsenal of}} weapons {{includes}} pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and throwing knives, among others. Guns have a finite magazine {{and must be}} reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots, but the player may acquire and carry as many weapons as can be found in each mission. The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK, called the PP7 special issue in-game. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts (although their names are altered), while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire, degree of penetration, and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part <b>they</b> <b>hit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years, with systems named after places or things <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> before the formal start of naming. The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems {{in a brief}} form, that is readily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|A {{player is}} {{eliminated}} when <b>they</b> are <b>hit</b> by a paintball that breaks on {{any part of}} the body or equipment. Upon elimination the player must place their gun behind their start station and go to their team's deadbox. If a player fails to acknowledge a <b>hit</b> <b>they</b> run the risk of being given a penalty of varying intensity.|$|R

50|$|Bulldogs: They are {{as their}} name suggests: tough but slow. Appearing as purple men, <b>they</b> require two <b>hits</b> to be killed, and can regain their {{strength}} if left alone {{for too long}} between <b>hits.</b> <b>They</b> can only carry regular Discs.|$|R
5|$|To {{successfully}} complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills {{and how many}} uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: 'Climbers' climb vertically though fall down if <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> an overhang. 'Floaters' use a parachute to fall safely from heights. 'Bombers' explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. 'Blockers' stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. 'Builders' build a stairway of 12 steps. 'Bashers', 'Miners' and 'Diggers' dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, steamboat operation was extremely difficult and proved {{to be anything but}} cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> rocks in the Columbia. The first steamboat to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three steamboat trips through the canal.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 {{campaign}} was Leicester's first season outside {{the top two}} levels of English football, but <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions, the fastest seven-year {{rise to the top}} of the English football league system apart from Ipswich Town in 1962. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand. The 2009–10 season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.|$|E
