40|$|The {{research}} was motivated {{to establish a}} scientific basis for the required number of steel tie bands used in wrapping and fastening hot rolled coils produced in steel manufacture lines for safe delivery and storage. Strain gages were installed on the tie bands and stress was recorded during the banding and delivery procedure of rolls in the field. The stress developing in the bands due to fastening of the roll and that due to springback of the coil were clearly distinguishable from the strain gage signals. Twelve hot rolled coils having different yield strength, thickness, width, and weight were tested in the recoiling field. The results showed the average tensile stress developing in the bands due to the fastening of the roll to be 151. 7 ± 53. 8 MPa, which corresponded to one fourth of the failure strength of the steel band in the buckle region. In addition to the stress caused by fastening, average tensile stress caused by springback of the rolled coils {{was estimated to be}} 33 MPa. It increased to 79 MPa when one of the tie bands was removed from the roll. Comparing the measured stress due to springback with the theoretical stress formula yielded a proportional constant value of 0. 219, and a correlation coefficient of 0. 914, which demonstrate the formula to be useful in predicting springback stress. The average safety factor of the <b>tie</b> <b>band</b> was found to be 3. 26 and it decreased to 2. 60 when one of the bands was removed from the roll. The safety factor of the band was found to decrease with increased coil thickness because the current factory standard on the number of bands does not significantly take into account of increase in the springback force with increased coil thickness...|$|E

Conventional bands have a fixed size that often require re-operation to adjust (either a <b>tied</b> <b>band</b> or suturing the artery itself). This conventional banding, requires {{high levels of}} specific surgical experience and judgement. Adjustment of conventional bands requires re-operation with its related risks and costs.|$|R

5000|$|The SMU Mustang Band earned its {{reputation}} as [...] "The Best-Dressed Band in the Land" [...] because of its multiple uniforms with a style that mimics a swing band more than a typical marching band. It has 32 different uniforms made up of varying combinations of pants, shirts, coats, and <b>ties.</b> <b>Band</b> members wear one uniform for the pregame performance and change to another just before halftime at all SMU football games where the band plays. The uniform style reinforces the music style of a jazz band.|$|R
50|$|The {{convocation}} habit or chimere is like {{a scarlet}} full-dress gown, except in {{that it has no}} sleeves, is fully lined with silk of the appropriate colour, and closed at the front. It is worn over the black undress gown, with the sleeves of the undress gown pulled through the armholes. It is always worn with white <b>tie,</b> <b>bands</b> and hood. A similar garment (in scarlet or black) is worn over a white rochet by bishops in the Church of England e.g. when sitting in the House of Lords.|$|R
40|$|Premise of the study: Dendrometer {{bands are}} a useful {{way to make}} {{sequential}} repeated measurements of tree growth, but traditional dendrometer bands can be expensive, time consuming, and difficult to construct in the field. An alternative to the traditional method of band construction is to adapt commercially available materials. This paper describes how to construct and install dendrometer bands using smooth-edged, stainless steel, cable <b>tie</b> <b>banding</b> and attachable rollerball heads. Methods and Results: As a performance comparison, both traditional and cable <b>tie</b> dendrometer <b>bands</b> were installed on baldcypress trees at the National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, Louisiana, by both an experienced and a novice worker. Band installation times were recorded, and growth of the trees as estimated by the two band types was measured after approximately one year, demonstrating equivalence of the two methods. Conclusions: This efficient approach to dendrometer band construction can help advance the knowledge of long-term tree growth in ecological studies...|$|R
