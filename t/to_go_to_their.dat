5|$|During the Knockout Round of the playoffs, the Sounders drew Sporting Kansas City. Both {{teams were}} held {{scoreless}} until Nelson Valdez, {{who had not}} scored all year, made the go-ahead goal at the 88th minute. The Sounders then faced the 2016 Supporters' Shield and U.S. Open Cup winners FC Dallas in the Conference Semi-final, a rematch of the year before. The Sounders defeated FC Dallas 3–0 at home and 4–2 on aggregate, advancing to the Western Conference Final. The Sounders then defeated the Colorado Rapids 3–1 on aggregate, with Jordan Morris scoring the final goal of the season, finally breaking through <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> first-ever MLS Cup.|$|E
5|$|Once in control, {{however, the}} group allows power <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> heads. At first they {{efficiently}} implement their ideas for Springfield, which include banning green traffic lights and playing only classical {{music at the}} dog races, which elevates Springfield past East St. Louis {{on the list of}} America's 300 Most Livable Cities. However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a public meeting (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held {{before the race}} on Friday. The first session lasted 80 minutes long, while the second was 85 minutes long. Kurt Busch was quickest {{with a time of}} 26.366 seconds in the first session, more than five-tenths of a second faster than Jeff Burton. Denny Hamlin was just off Burton's pace, followed by Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski. Kasey Kahne was seventh, still within a second of Kurt Busch's time. Also in the session, Trevor Bayne collided into the wall, so the team had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> back-up car. In the second practice session, Kyle Busch was fastest with a time of 26.454 seconds, only one-hundredth of a second quicker than second-placed David Ragan. Edwards took third place, ahead of Jamie McMurray, Greg Biffle and Martin. Newman only managed seventh place.|$|E

25|$|Gregory was {{particularly}} {{concerned with the}} East. The schism between Rome and the Byzantine Empire was a severe blow to him, and he worked hard to restore the former amicable relationship.

When the news of the Muslim attacks on the Christians in the East filtered through to Rome, and the political embarrassments of the Byzantine emperor increased, he conceived the project of a great military expedition and exhorted the faithful to participate in recovering the Church of the Holy Sepulchre – foreshadowing the First Crusade. In his efforts to recruit for the expedition, he emphasized the suffering of eastern Christians, arguing western Christians had a moral obligation <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> aid.|$|E
25|$|Donald McAdams {{wrote that}} in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and {{stronger}} test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children {{as long as the}} minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very poor black children tended <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> neighborhood schools outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD neighborhood schools made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E

According to synagogue legend, the founders had grown tired of rowing across the East River each Friday to celebrate Shabbat in Manhattan. Carol Levin, however, writes that a ferry service from Whitehall Street in Manhattan to South Ferry, Brooklyn (at the foot of Atlantic Street) had existed since 1836 (see South Ferry (ferry)), that the Atlantic Street synagogue's location, so close to the ferry terminus, [...] "must have seemed convenient to many", and that [...] "erry service was fast, frequent and inexpensive...

While saying the group would assemble to record new material, Lee announced the release of The Open Door to her fans during a post on an unofficial Evanescence website, EvBoard.com. The album progressed slowly because of Lee's desire to maximize the creative process and not rush production, other band members' side projects, guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke, Will Boyd's and Ben Moody's departure, and the loss of their former manager. Lee said on a fan's internet forum the new recording would be completed in March 2006; the release was postponed because [...] "Wind-up Records...wanted to make a few changes to the upcoming single [...] "Call Me When You're Sober".

In August 1996, Oasis sold out two nights at Knebworth, playing to over 250,000 fans. Following the {{worldwide}} success of Morning Glory?, Be Here Now (1997) became Oasis' most eagerly anticipated album to date. As with the previous two albums, all the tracks were written by Gallagher. After an initial blaze of publicity, positive critical reviews, and commercial success, the album {{failed to live up}} to long-term expectations, and public goodwill towards Be Here Now was short-lived. The album was ultimately regarded by many as a bloated, over-indulgent version of Oasis, which Gallagher has since blamed on the drug-addicted state and indifference of the band at the time. While the album was a record breaker, selling 660,000 copies in seven days, Gallagher has been critical of the album's popularity, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good.

500|$|Australian naval historians David Stevens and Tom Frame {{disagree}} {{on what happens}} next.

Frame claims that the stokers returned to duty freely once the battlecruiser was underway, before Cumberledge cleared lower deck {{and spoke to the}} sailors. After addressing the sailors, Cumberledge gathered the ship's senior officers for an inquiry. Five men, including the Victoria Cross nominee from the Zeebrugge raid, were charged with inciting a mutiny and arrested pending a court-martial, which was held aboard [...] on 20 June, after Australia arrived in Sydney. The ruling was that the five men had [...] "joined a mutiny, not accompanied by violence", and they were sentenced to imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for two years with hard labour. A number of other sailors were charged with participating in a mutiny, but again, Stevens and Frame {{disagree on}} details: the former claims 7 men were successfully charged, while the latter says 32 sailors were subsequently acquitted of mutiny, but then successfully charged with refusing duty.
