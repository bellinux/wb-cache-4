50|$|In 1956, Vienna's first {{articulated}} trams, {{designated as}} Type D, were commissioned from Gräf & Stift. Due to the tight financial situation, the new trams were assembled from salvaged parts. The basis {{of each one}} was two old Stadtbahn trailer chassis, on which modern car bodies were mounted. The chassis and bodies were then connected, {{by means of a}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>joint</b> section, of Italian design. The prototype of the Type D, with road number 4301, was delivered on 3 July 1957. After the testing and commissioning process had been completed, the Type D entered service from 17 February 1958. The inaugural trip operated by these trams was on Line 71.|$|E
40|$|The main {{concerns}} during drilling {{operations are}} riser integrity and maintaining well control. This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine riser package, riser joints, lower marine riser package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the <b>telescopic</b> <b>joint</b> haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the <b>telescopic</b> <b>joint</b> are not unique there are also experienced failure with tensioner system, flex joint and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and riser pipe in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the riser pipe place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the riser pipe wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use buoyancy modules to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back. Solutions like redesign of the <b>telescopic</b> <b>joint</b> and blowout preventer is advised by operators, but some of the solution are proven to be economical unprofitable...|$|E
40|$|A {{workover}} riser {{is a top}} tensioned riser, {{in essence}} similar to a marine riser. Workover risers differ from marine risers mainly by smaller dimensions, as well as simpler solutions at the riser ends. For instance, the lower flex joint of the marine riser is in the workover riser replaced by a tapered stress joint, and the workover riser has no <b>telescopic</b> <b>joint</b> at the upper end. The similarities between workover and marine risers make it convenient to apply the knowledge acquired for marine risers when performing analyses for workover risers. However, {{based on the findings}} in this thesis, one must be careful when assuming similarities between marine and workover risers. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of a monitoring system for workover risers. This investigation requires an understanding of a workover riser s behavior, and its response to relevant excitations. A literature review has been done, describing the various workover riser components, as well as the actual applications for a workover riser. The monitoring system suggested will utilize a set of strain sensors. Strain sensors are already mounted on the riser s stress joint and tension joint. A review of strain sensor technology is included. A workover riser system has been modeled in two separate softwares, Flexcom and RIFLEX. A brief review of selected aspects of these softwares are provided. Two separate softwares were required in order to validate the analysis results, as the riser s dynamic behavior was different from what was expected. The unexpected results occurred as the level of current was changed. It was found that an increased current magnitude is beneficial with respect to the riser s fatigue life. By reducing the current magnitude, from the design condition with one year return period, by a factor of ten, the lifetime of certain riser components has been found to drop by a factor of approximately 16 in one of the softwares. This trend was also validated by the other software, though the factor by which the fatigue life drops remains disputable. A monitoring system is suggested, where the fatigue damage of each component is extrapolated from the known values at the riser s stress joint. This system requires two extrapolation factors; one factor considers each component s location compared to the stress joint, while the other factor accounts for the environmental conditions. Determining the value of the factor accounting for environmental conditions has proved the biggest challenge. Particularly, the effect of current and current direction must be mapped thoroughly. Measuring the current with sufficient accuracy can prove difficult as well. Riser tension must also be studied further, as it is not only an influential parameter itself, but it also affects other parameters. Based on the analyses done in this thesis, it is concluded that the feasibility of a riser monitoring system for estimation of fatigue damage is promising. A definite conclusion cannot be drawn, as large amounts of work remain in order to map the influence of all important parameters accurately. It is found that the development of such a monitoring system is an ambitious undertaking, though it appears possible...|$|E

Unlike conventional reconfigurable robots, the final design illustrated {{in this paper}} does not achieve re-configurability through modular joints; instead, it is equipped with passive <b>telescopic</b> <b>joints.</b> These passive joints allow the robotic arm to change its Denavit- Hartenberg parameters via an innovative breaking system. The robotic arm itself presents many advantages; {{not only is it}} versatile to perform various tasks, but it can be packed into a small volume, as usually required for launch in space applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to extend the {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) passive dynamic biped walker to a 3 -D dynamic biped walker, i. e., a walker that can walk on a horizontal surface based on a passive dynamic walking. A new prototype of 3 -D biped walker called RW 04, which has <b>telescopic</b> knee <b>joints,</b> was developed and its ability for walking was validated through some experiments. A sinusoidal oscillation, which is regarded as a central pattern generator with no sensory feedback, was provided to the knee joints to achieve the biped walking. The results showed that the biped gait of RW 04 was possible only via a sinusoidal oscillation of the knee joint. Moreover, the 3 -D dynamic walking gait via frequency response and zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory was also analyzed. The biped locomotion had a resonance, i. e., the frequency matched the natural frequency of the locomotion in the gain property. An “ 8 ” shaped ZMP trajectory was observed, which was found to be similar to that of the human gait. However, the simple sinusoidal oscillation had limitations such as stride reduction or discontinuation by phase difference. Therefore, in future work, more adaptable control strategy such as a sensory feedback using ZMP should be provided. ...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe push in the {{industry}} towards increasing the weather window for marine operations offshore leads to a focus on new technology. When performing workover operations in a subsea well, the workover riser is a physical connection between the well and the floating workover vessel. A floating vessel will experience wave induced motion and is therefore equipped with a heave compensator to allow for this relative motion without increasing the load to the riser. If the heave compensator fails or if the heave of the vessel exceeds the stroke length of the heave compensator, the workover riser can be subjected to an excessive axial force that could rupture the riser and damage subsea well barriers. A safety joint {{that is to be}} installed in the riser can improve the window for safe operation while reducing consequences if an accident were to occur. It is called the <b>Telescopic</b> Safety <b>Joint</b> (TSJ) and has been developed by FMC Technologies. The joint is designed to telescope when subjected to a predetermined axial force. The telescoping function of the joint will ensure that there is sufficient time for personnel onboard the vessel to activate the emergency disconnect function so that the riser can safely be disconnected from the well. The safety joint is a weak link. During installation of the workover system, the riser experiences loading conditions exceeding that of normal operation. There is a concern that the safety joint may take plastic damage during this installation. Hence the TSJ is equipped with an over-ride function that temporarily can increase the strength of the joint. The over-ride function works by pumping hydraulic pressure into external cylinders. The increase in the strength of the joint from the over-ride function depends upon the hydraulic pressure. This thesis studies the effect the over-ride function has on the weather window for installation of a workover system, comparing a fully pressurized over-ride function to a semi-pressurized over-ride function. Simulations in Orcaflex for various environmental conditions found the loads that the TSJ must be able to withstand for installation to be possible. A model of the joint was created in AUTODESK Inventor. Using ANSYS workbench, the model was tested to find out which loads that are acceptable and which loads leads to plastic damage of the joint both for the fully pressurized and semi-pressurized over-ride function. Combining the results for the fully- and semi-pressurized over-ride function test, with the results from the dynamic simulations performed in Orcaflex revealed an increase in installation window when using the fully pressurized over-ride function. The joint using the full capacity of the over-ride function was able to withstand 620 kNm before plastic damage took place. The joint using a semi-pressurized over-ride function began taking plastic damage at 400 kNm. The over-ride function increases the bending moment capacity of the joint by 55 %. Using the scatter diagram for the Draugen field to see how many observations has been made of the different sea states, the increased availability for installation when using the full capacity of the over-ride function, as opposed to the semi-pressurized joint was calculated. When installing the TSJ as the 2 nd riser joint, the availability increased by 21, 7 %. Installing the TSJ as the 3 rd joint increases the availability by 16, 7 %. Installation of the TSJ on the 4 th and 5 th joint gives an increase of respectively 2, 8 % and 0, 3 % when the full over-ride capacity is used. The over-ride functions proved to be so effective that the joint became stronger than the actual workover riser. Hand calculations showed that the riser would yield before the safety joint and thus the safety joint would not be a limiting factor for the workover installation activity if the over-ride function is active...|$|R
