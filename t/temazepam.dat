5|$|British law {{requires}} that <b>temazepam</b> (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of <b>temazepam</b> must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for <b>temazepam</b> and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for <b>temazepam</b> in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E
5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that <b>temazepam</b> {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. <b>Temazepam</b> abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place <b>temazepam</b> under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. <b>Temazepam</b> also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, since October 1993, benzodiazepines, {{including}} formulations containing {{less than}} 20mg of <b>temazepam,</b> are all placed on List 2 of the Opium Law. A prescription {{is needed for}} possession of all benzodiazepines. <b>Temazepam</b> formulations containing 20mg or greater of the drug are placed on List 1, thus requiring doctors to write prescriptions in the List 1 format.|$|E
5|$|A {{report of}} her autopsy was {{released}} in December 2016. Laurer died on April 20 of an overdose of alcohol, combined with the anxiety drugs diazepam and nordazepam, painkillers oxycodone and oxymorphone, and sleeping aid <b>temazepam.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the benzodiazepines are {{schedule}} 4 controlled drugs, {{except for}} flunitrazepam, <b>temazepam</b> and midazolam, which are schedule 3 controlled drugs and carry stronger penalties for possession and trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, benzodiazepines are Schedule IV drugs {{under the}} Federal Controlled Substances Act, even when {{not on the}} market (for example, {{nitrazepam}} and bromazepam). Flunitrazepam is subject to more stringent regulations in certain states and <b>temazepam</b> prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12–40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and <b>temazepam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and <b>temazepam,</b> and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as <b>temazepam,</b> nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), <b>temazepam</b> (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; <b>temazepam</b> appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, <b>temazepam</b> are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as <b>temazepam</b> or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and <b>temazepam.</b> The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, <b>temazepam</b> is {{more tightly}} {{controlled}} than other benzodiazepines. The <b>temazepam</b> product Normison was {{pulled out of}} shelves and banned because the liquid inside gelatin capsules had caused a large increase in intravenous <b>temazepam</b> use. The other <b>temazepam</b> product, Tenox, was not affected and remains as prescription medicine. <b>Temazepam</b> intravenous use has not decreased to the level before Normison came to the market.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many benzodiazepines, {{pharmacokinetic}} interactions {{involving the}} P450 system {{have not been}} observed with <b>temazepam.</b> <b>Temazepam</b> shows no significant interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, erythromycin). Oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of <b>temazepam</b> and speed up its elimination half-life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> (brand names Restoril and Normison, among others) is an intermediate-acting 3-hydroxy {{hypnotic}} of the benzodiazepine {{class of}} psychoactive drugs. It is the 3-hydroxy analogue of diazepam, {{and one of}} diazepam's primary active metabolites. <b>Temazepam</b> is approved for the short-term treatment of insomnia. In addition, <b>temazepam</b> has anxiolytic (antianxiety), anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> {{has very}} good bioavailability, with almost 100% being absorbed from the gut. The drug is metabolized through {{conjugation}} and demethylation prior to excretion. Most {{of the drug}} is excreted in the urine, with about 20% appearing in the faeces. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of <b>temazepam</b> (90%); the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl <b>temazepam</b> was a minor metabolite (7%).|$|E
25|$|Chronic or {{excessive}} use of <b>temazepam</b> may cause drug tolerance, which can develop rapidly, so this drug is not recommended for long-term use. In 1979, the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated that most hypnotics lose their sleep-inducing properties after about three to 14 days. In use longer than one to two weeks, tolerance will rapidly develop towards the ability of <b>temazepam</b> to maintain sleep, resulting {{in a loss of}} effectiveness. Some studies have observed tolerance to <b>temazepam</b> after as little as one week's use. Another study examined the short-term effects of the accumulation of <b>temazepam</b> over seven days in elderly inpatients, and found little tolerance developed during the accumulation of the drug. Other studies examined the use of <b>temazepam</b> over six days and saw no evidence of tolerance. A study in 11 young male subjects showed significant tolerance occurs to temazepam's thermoregulatory effects and sleep inducing properties after one week of use of 30-mg <b>temazepam.</b> Body temperature is well correlated with the sleep-inducing or insomnia-promoting properties of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are common}} drugs of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, {{particularly}} {{among those who}} may also be using other illicit drugs. The intravenous use of <b>temazepam</b> poses {{the greatest threat to}} those who misuse benzodiazepines. Simultaneous consumption of <b>temazepam</b> with heroin is a potential risk factor of overdose. An Australian study of non-fatal heroin overdoses noted that 26% of heroin users had consumed <b>temazepam</b> {{at the time of their}} overdose. This is consistent with an NSW investigation of coronial files from 1992. <b>Temazepam</b> was found in 26% of heroin-related deaths. <b>Temazepam,</b> including tablet formulations, are used intravenously. In an Australian study of 210 heroin users who used <b>temazepam,</b> 48% had injected it. Although abuse of benzodiazepines has decreased over the past few years, <b>temazepam</b> continues to be a major drug of abuse in Australia. In certain states like Victoria and Queensland, <b>temazepam</b> accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary. Darke, Ross & Hall found that different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential. The more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference for a benzodiazepine were that it was the ‘strongest’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> {{should not}} be used in pregnancy, as it may cause harm to the fetus. The safety and {{effectiveness}} of <b>temazepam</b> has not been established in children; therefore, <b>temazepam</b> should generally not be given to individuals under 18 years of age, and {{should not be}} used at all in children under six months old. Benzodiazepines also require special caution if used in the elderly, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that <b>temazepam</b> and {{triazolam}} maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of <b>temazepam,</b> triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for <b>temazepam</b> and triazolam over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>temazepam</b> is a Class C {{controlled}} drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Schedule 3 under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001). If prescribed privately (not on the NHS), <b>temazepam</b> {{is available only}} by a special {{controlled drug}} prescription form (FP10PCD) and pharmacies are obligated to follow special procedures for storage and dispensing. Additionally, all manufacturers in the UK have replaced the gel-capsules with solid tablets. <b>Temazepam</b> requires safe custody and up until June 2015 was exempt from CD prescription requirements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> was {{synthesized}} in 1964, but it {{came into}} use in 1981 when its ability to counter insomnia was realized. By the late 1980s, <b>temazepam</b> {{was one of the}} most popular and widely prescribed hypnotics on the market and it became one of the most widely prescribed drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> {{accounts}} for most benzodiazepine sought by {{forgery of prescriptions}} and through pharmacy burglary in Victoria. Due to rife intravenous abuse, the Australian government decided to put it under a more restrictive schedule than it had been, and since March 2004 <b>temazepam</b> capsules have been withdrawn from the Australian market, leaving only 10mg tablets available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> and {{nitrazepam}} {{were the}} two benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose-related deaths in an Australian study of drug deaths. A 1993 British study found <b>temazepam</b> to have {{the highest number of}} deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s (11.9, versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol).|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam</b> {{is a drug}} with a high {{potential}} for misuse.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam is {{used for}} {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia related to sleep induction or sleep maintenance problems and has demonstrated superiority over other benzodiazepines such as <b>temazepam.</b> It had a fewer incidence of side effects than <b>temazepam,</b> including less sedation, amnesia, and less motor-impairment. Usual dosage is 7.5 to 15mg orally at bedtime.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, <b>temazepam</b> is a Schedule 3 {{controlled}} substance with strict restrictions.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, <b>temazepam</b> is a Schedule IV {{controlled}} drug under Decree-Law 15/93.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} benzodiazepines, <b>temazepam</b> {{produces}} additive CNS-depressant effects when coadministered with other medications which themselves produce CNS depression, such as barbiturates, alcohol, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants, nonselective MAO inhibitors, phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, skeletal muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and anaesthetics. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline {{has been shown}} to reduce the sedative effects of <b>temazepam</b> and other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Temazepam,</b> {{like other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs, can cause physical dependence and addiction. Withdrawal from <b>temazepam</b> or other benzodiazepines after regular use {{often leads to}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which resembles symptoms during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt withdrawal from therapeutic doses of <b>temazepam</b> after long-term use {{may result in a}} severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found <b>temazepam</b> is cross tolerant with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, <b>temazepam</b> is a Schedule IV {{controlled}} substance requiring a registered doctor's prescription.|$|E
25|$|In one study, {{the drug}} {{sensitivity}} {{of people who}} had used <b>temazepam</b> for one to 20 years was no different from that of controls. An additional study, in which {{at least one of the}} authors is employed by multiple drug companies, examined the efficacy of <b>temazepam</b> treatment on chronic insomnia over three months, and saw no drug tolerance, with the authors even suggesting the drug might become more effective over time.|$|E
25|$|In Switzerland, <b>temazepam</b> is a Class B {{controlled}} substance, {{like all}} other benzodiazepines. This means it is a prescription-only drug.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, <b>temazepam</b> is {{available}} for prescription as 10- or 20-mg tablets and capsules. Formulations of <b>temazepam</b> containing less than 20mg are included in List 2 of the Opium Law, while formulations containing 20mg {{or more of the}} drug (along with the gel-capsules) are a List 1 substance of the Opium Law, thus subject to more stringent regulation. Besides being used for insomnia, it is also occasionally used as a preanesthetic medication.|$|E
