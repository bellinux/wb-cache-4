5|$|<b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> {{fearing that}} the {{financial}} burden would be passed to them, protested the measures. The government, defending the measures as necessary in Hong Kong's changing economy, said that foreign domestic workers were still better paid {{than their counterparts in}} other Asian countries; according to James Tien, the monthly wage of Filipina maids in Singapore was about HK$1,400 and $1,130 in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the legal}} {{right-of-way}} was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, {{the need to}} hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E

5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Newport News was a {{rural area}} of {{plantations}} and a small fishing village until after the American Civil War. Construction of the railroad and establishment of the great shipyard brought <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> and associated development. It {{was one of only}} a few cities in Virginia to be newly established without earlier incorporation as a town. (Virginia has had an independent city political subdivision since 1871.) Walter A. Post served as the city's first mayor.|$|E
5|$|The Cripple Creek strike also {{transformed}} the Western Federation of Miners enormously {{as a political}} entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners throughout the West. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> joined the union {{over the next few}} years. Politicians and labor officials throughout the country became steady allies of the union, and the WFM became a political force throughout much of the Rocky Mountain West.|$|E

The strike began on July 23 when railroad workers walked off the job in protest of recent wage cuts, and within three days it grew to include perhaps <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> from a variety of industries.|$|E
5|$|The city {{hosted the}} 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics, {{attracting}} millions of visitors. Part {{of the infrastructure}} for the fair {{was the basis for}} major city institutions in Forest Park. In {{the early part of the}} century, many African Americans migrated from the South to the city for industrial jobs, as part of the Great Migration. St. Louis did not escape the Great Depression and its high unemployment. During World War II the city hosted war industries that employed <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result of a}} massive effort involving <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.|$|E

5|$|The city of Poznań {{was one of}} {{the largest}} urban and {{industrial}} centers of the People's Republic of Poland. Tensions were growing there, particularly since autumn of 1955. Workers in the largest factory in the city, Joseph Stalin's (or 'Cegielski's) Metal Industries, were complaining about higher taxes for most productive workers (udarnik), which affected several <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b> Local directors were unable to make any significant decisions due to micromanagement by the higher officials; over several months, petitions, letters and delegations were sent to the Polish Ministry of Machine Industry and Central Committee of Polish United Workers' Party, to no avail.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{population}} {{became more}} diverse {{after the end}} of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers.</b> In the 1950s, the Latino population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church and the First Spanish Baptist Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area. While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s. In response to subsequent challenges, the city has taken well-publicized steps to diversify economically, while building on some traditional strengths.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult to quantify. The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line. Workers income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was not as bad as predicted and <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of diamonds in Kimberley, in the British Colony of Griqualand West, attracted <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> black and white. Many {{young men from}} the amaHlubi became labourers on the mines and some were paid in guns rather than in money, a practice that was legal in Griqualand West. The Hlubi labourers habitually brought these guns back to their home in the Natal Colony, upon returning from the mines.|$|R

5|$|Yongle demoted Nanjing to a {{secondary}} capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China {{was to be}} at his power base in Beijing. Construction of a new city there lasted from 1407 to 1420, employing hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> daily. At the center was the political node of the Imperial City, and {{at the center of}} this was the Forbidden City, the palatial residence of the emperor and his family. By 1553, the Outer City was added to the south, which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4½ miles.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall in Georgia {{peaked at}} 8inches (203mm) in Mount Vernon. The {{precipitation}} assisted firefighters in combating wildfires {{in the southern}} portion of the state, which gave <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> a brief respite after they had fought the fires daily for over a month. The rainfall caused some minor flooding, and in Savannah a few minor traffic accidents occurred. Gusty winds blew down trees and power lines, and along the coast, rough surf was reported. Heavy rainfall from the storm spread {{across much of the}} East Coast of the United States. State totals peaked at 6.12inches (155mm) near Hardeeville, South Carolina, 3.73inches (95mm) in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, and 3.75inches (95mm) near Pennington Gap, Virginia. High winds also occurred in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The Fairbanks economy, which briefly boomed in {{the period}} between the {{discovery}} of oil and the legal challenge, stagnated as legal challenges dragged on. The challenges were ended by approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in late 1973. When pipeline work began in early 1974, it sparked a boom in Fairbanks unlike anything since the years immediately after the city's founding. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright. Tens of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, and public works. The population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} {{industry}} attracted people {{from within the}} borders of the United States, and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1871. In the 1880s, local attorney William R. Stewart was the second African American elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national Steel Strike of 1919, local industrialists recruited <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> from the South, many of whom were Black. This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace. Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative sharecropping system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.|$|E
5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E
