5|$|The UMWA {{took action}} against Pittston's new plan of {{operation}} {{and offered to}} reach a settlement. The coal company stayed quiet, and {{when the time came}} to renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers, Pittston refused. <b>The</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> grant {{affiliation}} {{caused a}} bitter row to ensue that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite {{not having the}} support of the governing body, the new league continued their plans regardless. No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally agreed affiliation in August 2003, with only weeks to go before the beginning of the new season.|$|E

5|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1874, the South Yorkshire {{company was}} {{absorbed into the}} Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Despite the railway competition, traffic levels {{remained}} healthy, with the waterways carrying a total of 982,000 tons in 1878, {{but there was a}} growing dissatisfaction with the situation, particularly the high tolls compared to the railways, and <b>the</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow steam haulage, which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years. In an attempt to improve the situation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888, with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company, and upgrading them to offer effective competition to the railways. As a result of their efforts, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889, with powers to raise £1.5 million to purchase and improve four canals. These were the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges, to investigate the use of compartment boats, and to build a new port facility at Keadby, where coal could be trans-shipped to seagoing vessels. Negotiations with the railway company were long and bitter, and the Navigation company only managed to raise £625,000 of the £1.14 million purchase price, with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them, the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors, and thus retained significant control.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, government practices in the colonies came under more scrutiny. Parliament passed the Navigation Acts to regulate trade {{for the benefit of}} the mother country. Massachusetts, with a thriving merchant fleet, often ran afoul of the trade regulations. Its government was reluctant to enforce them. Combined with intolerant religious practices, and <b>the</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> allow the Church of England to operate in the colony, led Charles II to formally vacate the Massachusetts charter in 1684.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> {{fight in}} the Sinai, Yadin {{permitted}} Allon to instead move from 'Auja to Rafah and encircle the Egyptians from there. While {{by the time of}} Yadin and Ben-Gurion's refusal, there had been almost no international pressure to stop the advance into the Sinai, partly because it had not been clear whether the Sinai had indeed been invaded, on December 30 both the British and American government called for Israel's withdrawal to the international boundary, and the British allowed the Egyptians to use their airbases in Egypt for refueling.|$|E
25|$|The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) {{proposal}} {{was seen as}} a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan.
