50|$|<b>Tracing</b> <b>paper</b> {{is named}} as such {{for its ability}} for an image to be traced onto it. When <b>tracing</b> <b>paper</b> is placed onto a picture, the picture is easily {{viewable}} through the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Thus, it becomes easy to find edges in the picture and trace the image onto the <b>tracing</b> <b>paper.</b> Pure cellulose fiber is translucent, {{and it is the}} air trapped between fibers, that makes paper opaque and looks white. If the fibers are refined and beaten until all the air is taken out, then the resulting sheet will be translucent. Translucent papers are dense and contain up to 10% moisture at 50% humidity. This type of paper is roughly 25% lighter than regular paper.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} ofthis {{study is}} to demonstrate ultra-low-cost <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> for the realization of inexpensive RFID tags that can be integrated with batteries and sensors for wireless sensing, tracking and monitoring applications. The first step toward achieving this goal is to demonstrate &quot;conductors on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> &quot; from processing standpoint and to characterize the electrical performance of <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> up to 2 GHz form design standpoint. The conductors are achieved by (i) direct-write ink jet printing technology with tailored conductive ink and by (ii) conventional copper etching upon lamination of metal foils on to the <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> There are several issues in optimizing the processes in {{either of the two}} approaches. For example, ink jet printing would require smooth surface finish, good adhesion, less smearing of the ink, fast curing profile, and ultimately copper-like conductivity of the printed ink and rapid prototyping for high volume manufacturing. On the other hand, metallization using copper will require bonding of copper onto paper surface, adhesion, compatibility with copper etch solutions and lithography, and moisture sealing. Both approaches have been successfully demonstrated for printing conductors on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> which can be easily scaled to large-quantity manufacturing. For the electrical characterization of the <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> up to 2 GHz, one microstrip ring resonator was designed and fabricated for extracting dielectric constant and dielectric losses.

40|$|In this study, microfibrillated {{cellulose}} (MFC) {{was applied}} {{in an aqueous}} suspension as a coating material on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> Two different coating techniques were used: rod coating and size press. The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> exhibited a higher roughness than the reference <b>paper</b> <b>substrate.</b> This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference <b>paper</b> <b>substrates,</b> and most importantly, reduced air permeance and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the rod coated <b>paper</b> <b>substrate</b> with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight. The water vapour transmission rate was also decreased with the applied MFC coatings. Advantages and drawbacks were identified for the coating techniques. The rod coating allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern. With the size press, coat weights around 1 g⁄m 2 were reached. The MFC did not build a coating layer on the <b>paper</b> <b>substrate</b> surface but was impregnated into the <b>paper</b> <b>substrate</b> by the rollers...|$|R

30|$|We {{have used}} a two-step growth {{strategy}} to prepare ZnO NW arrays on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> First, we synthesized ZnO NPs having a uniform size distribution (ca. 4 nm); here, the concentration of ZnO NPs was highly dependent {{on the amount of}} added NaOH. These ZnO NPs then served as seeds for the hydrothermal growth of ZnO NW arrays on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates.</b> When we used our solution containing the highest concentration of ZnO NPs, we obtained dense and uniform ZnO NW arrays that had grown conformally on the <b>paper</b> <b>substrate.</b> TEM analysis of these ZnO NWs not only revealed their single-crystalline nature but also confirmed the polarity of ZnO to be Zn-polarized (through ABF STEM analysis). From measurements of the photocatalytic activity toward MB of the ZnO NW arrays on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> at incident angles of 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 75 °, we calculated rate constants of 0.415, 0.244, 0.195, and 0.08 s- 1, respectively, revealing a dependence on the cosine of the incident angle of UV light. Such angle-dependent photocatalytic activity for biocompatible ZnO NWs on <b>paper</b> <b>substrates</b> suggests that such systems may have promising applications in the design of sterilization systems and light-harvesting devices.|$|R

ZnO nanostructures with hexagonal structure were synthesized by hydrothermal under microwave irradiation using an ultrafast approach, that is, a fixed synthesis time of 10 min. The effect of synthesis temperature on ZnO nanostructures was investigated from 70 to 130 °C. An Ultra Violet (UV) /Ozone treatment directly to the ZnO seed layer prior to microwave assisted synthesis revealed expressive differences regarding formation of the ZnO nanostructures.
