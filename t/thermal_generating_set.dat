40|$|AbstractThe paper aims at {{demonstrating that}} the {{consideration}} of constant start-up costs and ramps of the <b>thermal</b> <b>generating</b> units for assessing the contribution of pumped-hydro energy storage to reduce the scheduling costs of hydrothermal power systems with high wind penetration, may yield unrealistic results. For this purpose, an isolated power system {{is used as a}} case study. The contribution of a pumped-storage hydropower plant to reduce the system scheduling costs is assessed in the paper by using a hydrothermal weekly unit commitment model. The model considers different start-up costs and ramps of the <b>thermal</b> <b>generating</b> units {{as a function of the}} start-up type. The effects of including pumped hydro energy storage in the system on the integration of wind energy, and on the start-ups and capacity factors of the <b>thermal</b> <b>generating</b> units are also evaluated. The results of the paper demonstrate that {{the consideration of}} constant start-up costs and ramps of the <b>thermal</b> <b>generating</b> units yields unrealistic results, and that the pumped-storage hydropower plant may help reduce the system scheduling costs by 2. 5 – 11 % and integrate wind power and may allow dispensing with some inflexible <b>thermal</b> <b>generating</b> units...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A module M over a ring R is said {{to satisfy}} (P) if every gen-erating set of M {{contains}} an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The following results are proved; (1) Let τ = (Tτ,Fτ) be a hereditary torsion theory such that Tτ 6 = Mod-R. Then every τ-torsionfree R-module satisfies (P) {{if and only if}} S = R/τ(R) is a division ring. (2) Let K be a hereditary pre-torsion class of modules. Then every module in K satisfies (P) if and only if either K = { 0 } or S = R/SocK(R) is a division ring, where SocK(R) = ∩{I ≤ RR: R/I ∈ K}. For a right R-moduleM, a subset X ofM {{is said to}} be a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> ofM if M = Σx∈XxR; and a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is any <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> Y of M such that no proper subset of Y can generate M. A <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> X of M is called an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> if Σx∈XxR = ⊕x∈XxR. Clearly, every independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> but the converse is not true in general. For example, the set { 2, 3 } is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of ZZ but not an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> It is well-known that every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a right vector space over a division ring contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (or a basis). This motivated various interests in characterizing the rings R such that every module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> or every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of each module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (see, for example, [2], [8], [9], [11]). In [2, Theorem 2. 3], the authors proved that R is a division ring if and only if every R-module has a basis if and only if every irredundant subset of an R-module is independent. This result can be considered in a more general context of a torsion theory. For anR-moduleM,M is said to satisfy (P) if ever...|$|R
