5000|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{summation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Clipper's</b> design comes from Joel Prescott: [...] "The truth {{may well be}} that <b>the</b> <b>Clipper</b> should be remembered as automotive history's most successful committee design, because assigning the genius of its beautiful lines exclusively to one particular designer cannot now be done with any degree of certainty." [...] And as it turned out, this new look guaranteed <b>the</b> <b>Clipper</b> an appearance never compromised by competitive imitators. In 1942 Cadillac and Buick adopted the same pontoon fender line, but <b>the</b> <b>Clipper</b> still looked unique, apart from and slightly above the crowd, especially the new 1942 senior Clippers, which alone retained the debut 1941's 127 in wheelbase, longer hood and front fenders.|$|R

5|$|In 2014–15, Paul {{played in}} all 82 {{games for the}} first time in his career, {{averaging}} 19.1 points and a league-high 10.2 assists per game. In Game 7 of the first round of the playoffs, he hit a go-ahead shot with a second left to lift <b>the</b> <b>Clippers</b> over the Spurs despite a hamstring injury. The injury forced him to miss the first two games of the next series versus the Houston Rockets, and Los Angeles eventually lost in seven games despite holding a 3–1 series lead. The defeat marked ten consecutive seasons and seven consecutive playoff appearances without a Conference Finals appearance for Paul.|$|E

5|$|On December 8, 2011, the Hornets {{agreed to}} a three-team trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA, who owned the team at the time, nullified the deal, with {{commissioner}} David Stern claiming New Orleans {{would be better off}} keeping Paul. The teams involved in the trade attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail. On December 12, the Hornets {{agreed to a}} trade sending Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms. Two days later, the teams finally made the trade, sending Paul and two future second round draft picks to <b>the</b> <b>Clippers</b> for future teammate Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft. Upon the deal's completion, Paul announced that he would opt into the final year of his contract and remain in Los Angeles for at least two more seasons.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Scotland {{became one}} of the {{commercial}} and industrial centres of the British Empire. With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3million. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. <b>The</b> <b>clippers</b> belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when it sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began {{to make up for the}} loss of the tobacco business, reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2016, Nowitzki re-signed {{with the}} Mavericks. Nowitzki {{appeared}} {{in just three}} of the Mavericks' first 13 {{games of the season}} due to illness and a strained left Achilles tendon. He returned for the 14th game of the season, but with a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, the Mavericks fell to a 2–12 record – their worst start since going 1–23 in 1993–94. He appeared in one more before sitting out 14 straight with further Achilles tendon issues, this time on his right foot. In his return game on December 23, Nowitzki scored 17 first-half points (playing only 15 minutes before sitting out the second half) in a 90–88 win over <b>the</b> <b>Clippers.</b> On February 7, 2017 against Portland, Nowitzki moved into 10th place all-time in field goals with 10,517. Also, his two blocked shots against the Trail Blazers gave him 1,200 for this career, the 55th player in NBA history to reach that figure. On March 7, 2017, in a 122–111 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to score 30,000 regular-season points. He also became the first international player to reach the milestone and one of only three to score all 30,000-plus with one team—the others being Karl Malone (Utah) and Kobe Bryant (Lakers).|$|E
