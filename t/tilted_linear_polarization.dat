The transmission efficiency is found can be highly dependent on the tilt angle. It is also found that when the input photons are polarized not along the eigenmode directions of surface plasmon polariton, a birefringent phenomenon is observed when the array with periodic of subwavelength holes is <b>tilted.</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>polarization</b> states can be changed to elliptical polarization states and a phase can be added between two eigenmodes.

40|$|Our {{previous}} paper {{outlined the}} general {{aspects of the}} theory of radio light curve and polarization formation for pulsars. We predicted the one-to-one correspondence between the <b>tilt</b> of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> position angle of the and the circular polarization. However, some of the radio pulsars indicate a clear deviation from that correlation. In this paper we apply the theory of the radio wave propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere for the analysis of individual effects leading to these deviations. We show that within our theory the circular polarization of a given mode can switch its sign, without the need to introduce a new radiation mode or other effects. Moreover, we show that the generation of different emission modes on different altitudes can explain pulsars, that presumably have the X-O-X light-curve pattern, different from what we predict. General properties of radio emission within our propagation theory are also discussed. In particular, we calculate the intensity patterns for different radiation altitudes and present light curves for different observer viewing angles. In this context we also study the light curves and polarization profiles for pulsars with interpulses. Further, we explain the characteristic width of the position angle curves by introducing the concept of a wide emitting region. Another important feature of radio polarization profiles is the shift of the position angle from the center, which in some cases demonstrates a weak dependence on the observation frequency. Here we demonstrate that propagation effects do not necessarily imply a significant frequency-dependent change of the position angle curve.

The <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> degree, which exceeds 10 % at room temperature, and rotation of the polarization plane of their zero-phonon lines significantly depend on the crystal rotation around specific axes demonstrating anisotropic angular evolutions. The sign of the polarization plane rotation is changed periodically through the crystal rotation, which indicates a switching between electron excited states of orthogonal <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations.</b> At external magnetic fields of up to 10 T, the angular dependences of the <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> degree experience a remarkable phase shift.

40|$|The radiometric {{accuracy}} of space-borne instruments such as radiometers and spectroradiometers which make {{measurements of the}} earth and other celestial objects can be compromised by the <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> sensitivity (LPS) induced by the optical system.
