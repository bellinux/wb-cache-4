5|$|In the 1990s, the queercore {{movement}} developed {{around a}} number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.|$|E
5|$|Media {{coverage}} of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and {{the deaths of}} ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Jeffrey J. Kripal {{argued in}} his {{controversial}} , a psychoanalytic study of Ramakrishna's life, that Ramakrishna's mystical experiences were symptoms of repressed homoeroticism. Kripal also argued in Kali's Child that <b>the</b> Ramakrishna <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> manipulated Ramakrishna's biographical documents, that <b>the</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> published them in incomplete and bowdlerised editions (claiming among other things, hiding Ramakrishna's homoerotic tendencies), and that <b>the</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>had</b> suppressed Ram Chandra Datta's Srisriramakrsna Paramahamsadever Jivanavrttanta.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Hashomer Hatzair <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> {{positioned}} itself politically {{between the}} moderate mainstream Mapai and the radical communists since <b>the</b> 1920s. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> however {{been reluctant to}} form a political party, since its leaders had felt that entering into party politics could push <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> into ideological deviations. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>had</b> tried to seek unity with Mapai and Ahdut HaAvoda before forming a party of its own, but those merger talks had failed as the other parties rejected the bi-nationalist positions of Hashomer Hatzair.|$|R

5|$|To {{some degree}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been successful. Beginning in 1998, the {{official}} curriculum in Taiwan schools {{has been changed}} to contain more frequent and favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> drawn many {{followers}} {{from the}} middle class and is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that the movement was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has,</b> {{along with}} the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, refused {{to work with the}} NGO-run 'Social Movements Indaba' (SMI), and some of the NGOs {{involved}} with the SMI. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been particularly critical of the Centre for Civil Society at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and refuses to work with the Centre.|$|E

25|$|A primary {{demand of}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> been for decent, public housing {{and much of}} its work {{takes the form of}} {{opposing}} evictions. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> often used the phrase 'The Right to the City' to insist that the location of housing is critically important and demands that shack settlements are upgraded where they are and that people are not relocated to out of town developments. The movement rejects technocratic approaches to the housing crisis and stresses the need for dignity to be central to the resolution of the housing crisis. It is opposed to shack dwellers being moved into 'transit camps'.|$|E

25|$|Abahlali's {{original}} work was primarily committed to opposing demolitions and forced removals and to struggling for good land and quality {{housing in the}} cities.

However <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> also argued that basic services such as water, electricity and toilets should be immediately provided to shack settlements while land and housing in the city are negotiated. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>has</b> also engaged in the mass popular appropriation of access to water and electricity.|$|E
