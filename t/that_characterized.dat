5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more {{primitive}} archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E

5|$|In South America, dire wolves {{have been}} dated younger than 17,000 YBP and {{reported}} from only three localities: Muaco in Falcón state, Venezuela; Talara Province in Peru; and Tarija Department in Bolivia. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America {{because of the}} favorable cool, dry, and open habitats <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical rain forest.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|Nikita Khrushchev {{was ousted}} as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) (as well as Chairman of the Council of Ministers) on 14 October 1964, {{due to his}} failed reforms and {{disregard}} for Party and Government institutions. Brezhnev replaced Khrushchev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin replaced him as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Anastas Mikoyan, and later Nikolai Podgorny, became Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Together with Andrei Kirilenko as organizational secretary, and Mikhail Suslov as Chief Ideologue, they made up a reinvigorated collective leadership, which contrasted in form with the autocracy <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> Khrushchev's rule.|$|E

5|$|The ARVN 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron {{was then}} {{deployed}} {{to rescue the}} South Vietnamese soldiers and US aircrews who were trapped at the southwest end of Ap Bac, but its commander was highly reluctant to move heavy M113 APCs across the local terrain. Ultimately, their presence made little difference as the NLF stood its ground and killed {{more than a dozen}} South Vietnamese M113 crew members in the process. Late in the afternoon, the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion was dropped onto the battlefield and, in a scene <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> much of the day's fighting, were pinned down and could not break the NLF's line of defense. Under the cover of darkness the Viet Cong withdrew from the battlefield, having won their first major victory.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the chaos}} <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> {{the years when}} Emperor Dom PedroII was a minor, Inhaúma {{remained}} loyal to the government. He helped quell a military mutiny in 1831 and was involved in suppressing {{some of the other}} rebellions that erupted during that troubled period. He saw action in the Sabinada between 1837 and 1838, followed by the Ragamuffin War from 1840 until 1844. In 1849, after spending two years in Great Britain, Inhaúma was given command of the fleet that was instrumental in subduing the Praieira revolt, the last rebellion in imperial Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Although Palmyrene art {{was related}} to that of Greece, it had a {{distinctive}} style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the bust reliefs which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The reliefs emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which {{can be seen as}} a forerunner of Byzantine art. According to Michael Rostovtzeff, Palmyra's art was influenced by Parthian art. However, the origin of frontality <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by Daniel Schlumberger), Michael Avi-Yonah contends that it was a local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged frieze and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed to museums in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.|$|E

5|$|In 1825, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia {{became the}} {{governor}} of the Buenos Aires province, he held a meeting with representatives from all provinces in Argentina. Facundo was present as {{the governor of}} La Rioja. Rivadavia was soon overthrown, and Manuel Dorrego became the new governor. Sarmiento contends that Dorrego, a Federalist, was interested neither in social progress nor in ending barbaric behaviour in Argentina by improving the level of civilization and education of its rural inhabitants. In the turmoil <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> Argentine politics at the time, Dorrego was assassinated by Unitarists and Facundo was defeated by Unitarist General José María Paz. Facundo escaped to Buenos Aires and joined the Federalist government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. During the ensuing civil war between the two ideologies, Facundo conquered the provinces of San Luis, Cordoba and Mendoza.|$|E
5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared {{no better}} on their next possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some of the effectiveness <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, {{more than a quarter of}} the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E

5|$|To some extent, the {{difficulties}} both Gebhard and Ernst faced {{in winning the}} war were the same the Spanish had in subduing the Dutch Revolt. The protraction of the Spanish and Dutch war—80 years of bitter fighting interrupted by periodic truces while both sides gathered resources—lay {{in the kind of}} war it was: Enemies lived in fortified towns defended by Italian-style bastions, which meant the towns had to be taken and then fortified and maintained. For both Gebhard and Ernst, as for the Spanish commanders in the nearby Lowlands, winning the war meant not only mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless cycle of enemy artillery fortresses, but also maintaining the army one had and defending all one's own possessions as they were acquired. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt in that respect, was also a war of sieges, not of assembled armies facing one another on the field of battle, nor of maneuver, feint, and parry <b>that</b> <b>characterized</b> wars two centuries earlier and later. These wars required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating. The Spanish faced another problem, distance, which gave them a distinct interest in intervening in the Cologne affair: the Electorate lay on the Rhine River, and the Spanish road.|$|E
