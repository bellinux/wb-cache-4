5|$|Nigerian <b>television</b> <b>has</b> been a {{particularly}} fruitful source for episode recovery; {{a total of}} 15 out of the 50 episodes recovered since 1978 have been reclaimed from Nigeria, leading to the completion of three full serials (The Time Meddler, The War Machines, and The Enemy of the World).|$|E
50|$|Media {{reformatting}} {{is extremely}} important because the formatting of images on TV sets differs significantly according to the technology employed. For instance, some <b>televisions</b> <b>have</b> an interlaced picture, whereas others have a progressive-scan picture. Different <b>televisions</b> <b>have</b> a different aspect ratio.|$|R

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{created to}} address the needs of the Chinese-language media market, the media organizations have expanded into dozens of additional languages; The Epoch Times newspaper is distributed across over 30 countries in 17 languages, and NTD <b>Television</b> <b>has</b> a satellite or cable presence in North America, Europe, and Asia, and produces programs in 18 languages. The organizations maintain that they are not formally affiliated with Falun Gong, which lacks both a centralized organization and funds. However, most of their staff are Falun Gong practitioners, and many contribute on a volunteer basis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the capital}} of India, Delhi {{is the focus of}} {{political}} reportage, including regular television broadcasts of Parliament sessions. Many national media agencies, including the state-owned Press Trust of India, Media Trust of India and Doordarshan, is based in the city. Television programming includes two free terrestrial television channels offered by Doordarshan, and several Hindi, English, and regional-language cable channels offered by multi system operators. Satellite <b>television</b> <b>has</b> yet to gain a large quantity of subscribers in the city.|$|E

5|$|Television and {{newspapers}} take {{an important role}} in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. For a long time, newspapers were regarded as the most influential information medium in Japan, although audience attitudes towards television changed with the emergence of commercial news broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Over the last decade, <b>television</b> <b>has</b> clearly come to surpass newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Television</b> <b>has</b> {{played a}} major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's {{decision}} to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through <b>television</b> <b>has</b> {{long been a}} goal of the CFL although {{the results have been}} intermittent. As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
5|$|WIN Television carries {{programming}} of {{all three}} commercial television stations in Australia. It is a sole Network Ten affiliate in all broadcast areas, but also carries Seven Network and the Nine Network affiliated channels in Griffith, New South Wales and eastern South Australia. WIN <b>Television</b> <b>has</b> always produced regional programming, including the flagship local news service WIN News, that supplement programs sourced from affiliates.|$|E
5|$|All other {{commercial}} stations have 1080i high definition services which, since 2015, simulcast their main channel from standard definition. Prior to this, HD broadcasts are shown as a multichannel providing some differing content {{from the main}} SD channel. For instance, ABC <b>Television</b> <b>has</b> a 720p high definition service, which used to run as ABC-HD (simulcasting ABC1), but now operates as ABC News 24. Currently, SBS Television, the Nine Network and its regional station NBN Television, Network Ten, and WIN Television broadcast a 1080i high definition simulcast of their respective main channel. The Seven Network also has a relaunched HD channel, yet it isn't implemented as the primary channel's HD simulcast across all metropolitan stations to allow the games of the Australian Football League be broadcast in HD. Only the Melbourne and Adelaide stations received its channel on its purpose; Sydney, Perth and Brisbane stations, meanwhile, continues to air digital multichannel 7mate in high definition through 7HD, with the former downgraded to standard definition by default.|$|E

5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching <b>television</b> <b>has</b> a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E
5|$|Oxford Street changed {{character}} from residential to retail {{towards the end}} of the 19th century. Drapers, cobblers and furniture stores began to appear on the street, and were later expanded into the first department stores. Street vendors began to sell tourist souvenirs on the street during this time. A plan of Oxford Street in Tallis's London Street Views, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all the street, save for the far western end, was primarily retail. John Lewis started in 1864 as a small shop at No.132, while Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No.400. Most of the southern side of Oxford Street west of Davies Street was completely rebuilt between 1865 and 1890, allowing a more uniform freehold ownership. By the 1930s, the street was almost entirely retail, a position that remains today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a seedy element including street traders and prostitutes. Aside from a number of fixed places on the street, there are no provisions for selling licensed goods on Oxford Street. The advent of closed-circuit <b>television</b> <b>has</b> reduced the attraction of the area to scam artists and illegal street traders.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how <b>television</b> <b>has</b> kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E

50|$|As an example: a man {{purchased}} {{a television set}} for $2,000 {{five years ago and}} it was destroyed in a hurricane.
