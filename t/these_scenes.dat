5|$|More than 15 {{minutes of}} footage was deleted during {{post-production}} of Unbreakable. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> {{are available on}} the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Some {{paintings}} also {{depict the}} sacrifice of Aravan. In <b>these</b> <b>scenes,</b> he is often depicted bowing to Kali, while his head {{is about to be}} severed; or, as in one Sowcarpet painting, a self-decapitated Aravan holds both a sword and his own severed head, offering the latter to the goddess.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} nine {{missions that}} Cord has to complete. Almost every mission {{ends with a}} transitional cut scene, showing how Cord is interrogated and tortured. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> include other characters like Alpha or Kostov, who will give information about the next missions.|$|E
25|$|There were {{a number}} of scenes deleted from the final cut that made it to wide release. Some of <b>these</b> deleted <b>scenes</b> were {{published}} by Merantau Films on their YouTube page. <b>These</b> following <b>scenes,</b> however, are not equipped with proper sound editing and special effects.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} an {{accomplished}} bio-illustrator. Bayer painted and designed a total of fourteen scientifically accurate marine <b>scenes.</b> <b>These</b> particular <b>scenes</b> were used {{for a set of}} Haitian postage stamps in 1973.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> deleted <b>scenes</b> {{were all}} {{included}} in the Blu-ray release of the film.|$|R
5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E
5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this discovery, Kate locks herself in her crime lab and tries {{to come to terms}} with what just happened, while the police struggle in vain to find any sign of Alice's corpse. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> are depicted amongst numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue. Throughout them, back story is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother have been killed by the time he arrives.|$|E
5000|$|With {{regard to}} <b>these</b> {{controversial}} <b>scenes</b> actress Jane Alexander {{has said the}} following: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Terror marketing" [...] {{to recruit}} new fighters is another motivation. [...] "Some {{of these men}} {{have sort of a}} pornographic {{attraction}} to <b>these</b> violent <b>scenes,</b> <b>these</b> violent beheading videos. It really sort of energizes them." [...] said Paul Cruickshank, a terrorism analyst for CNN.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 {{she played}} a part in the Edie Sedgwick film, Ciao! Manhattan. The film took four years to make and drastic changes were made from the {{original}} story causing the filmmakers to remove many scenes shot in 1967, which included Nena's <b>scenes.</b> <b>These</b> deleted <b>scenes</b> {{can be found on the}} DVD version.|$|R
5|$|Julian Glover was a {{well-established}} character actor {{who had previously}} appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade (1965). Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had shed his human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey in many of <b>these</b> <b>scenes.</b> Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan {{on account of his}} resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the special}} edition's footage was first seen when the film made its {{broadcast}} television debut on CBS in 1989, but two additional sequences concerning Burke's transmission to the colony about the derelict, and the Jorden family's subsequent discovery of the same, {{were added to the}} initial Laserdisc release. According to Cameron, the visual effects for the scene were incomplete, so {{he went back to the}} Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences. All currently available versions {{of the special}} edition contain <b>these</b> <b>scenes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of <b>these</b> <b>scenes,</b> which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a framework for}} the control of automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The framework implements the transport system as a community of cooperating agents. Besides the architecture and elements of the framework {{a wide range of}} infrastructure scene templates is described. <b>These</b> <b>scene</b> templates, ranging from terminal infrastructure to freeways, can be used as building blocks to create a control system for an automated transport network.

50|$|Jan van Wechelen {{succeeded in}} <b>these</b> genre <b>scenes</b> {{to bring the}} kermesses to life. He was close to Pieter Brueghel the Elder {{in his ability to}} animate <b>these</b> picturesque <b>scenes</b> with a great number of {{characters}} with comical and delightful attitudes. The realism in his genre paintings reveal a rather profane spirit while his lines with clearly emphasized forms connect his work to the rigorist trends that were developing in the Low Countries around 1540.|$|R
50|$|The Song Capital Street (Song Du Yu Jie) is a {{restored}} road {{made to look}} like <b>these</b> <b>scene</b> in the Qingming Scroll. It is about 400 metres long and runs southwards from entrance of Longting park. The road is lined with two story wooden buildings with tile roofs {{made to look like}} authentic Song dynasty architecture. Archeological excavation below the modern road found the remains of the old Song dynasty imperial way.|$|R
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for <b>these</b> <b>scenes,</b> McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the church}} are six {{bas-relief}} panels, previously {{held in the}} ossuary, <b>these</b> depicting <b>scenes</b> {{from the life of}} Saint Edern.|$|R
25|$|On June 14, Sakanaction's {{management}} group Hip Land Music posted a request asking for 500 extras for a Sakanaction music video <b>scene.</b> <b>These</b> extras shot <b>scenes</b> for the video {{in a studio}} in Kawaguchi, Saitama on June 18, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Heart = Affiliation with {{character}} on panel increases, sometimes the affiliation with another character will increase as well. On certain panels with this bonus, {{if you choose}} the right dialogue option, the {{character on}} the event panel will join your team. Early examples of this are Kira, Hisagi, and Komamura, and <b>these</b> <b>scene's</b> usually have the character name and the word [...] "cooperation" [...] {{in the title of}} the event (ex: Kira's Cooperation, Hisagi's Cooperation, Komamura's Cooperation).|$|R
5|$|The DVD release {{included}} a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes {{he intended to}} include in the release. However, <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> are not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would detract from the film's integrity.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{opens with}} Lopez and her love {{interest}} conversing {{on the side}} walk {{in front of a}} shop window. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> are intercut with that of suspicious men in a van, observing Lopez and her lover. Later, Lopez and her lover split and she starts singing as she walks down the street. She goes inside a boutique and enters through at a secret door. As she enters, she takes off a wig and changes her clothing. She enters in a room where there are pictures of her lover scattered across a table. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> are intercut with scenes of Lopez and her lover laying in a grass. As the video progresses, Lopez is seen sad, accompanied with her love interest and his friend in an apartment; they are observing from a window with binoculars. It is revealed that the men {{from the beginning of the}} video are FBI officers and they are entering the building abruptly. They break into Lopez and her lover's apartment and arrest him. In the end, it is revealed that Lopez is an undercover FBI agent who surrenders her boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. The player has a chance to assume the role of four protagonists, two in each Ef: The First Tale and Ef: The Latter Tale. Each protagonist is paired with a heroine, and each scenario in the original PC versions of the visual novels includes scenes with sexual content. <b>These</b> <b>scenes</b> are removed or modified in the PlayStation 2 port.|$|E
25|$|Mohamed Yacoub {{attributes}} {{a protective}} function to <b>these</b> two <b>scenes,</b> {{a means of}} invoking fate, a practice which is probably based on Hellenic tradition.|$|R
25|$|In 1996, Night Slave was {{a shooter}} RPG {{released}} for the PC-98 that combined the side-scrolling shooter gameplay of Assault Suits Valken and Gradius, including an armaments system that employs recoil physics, with many RPG {{elements such as}} permanently levelling up the mecha and various weapons using power-orbs obtained from defeating enemies as well as storyline cut <b>scenes.</b> <b>These</b> cut <b>scenes</b> also occasionally contain lesbian adult content.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A ghostly Dr. Mabuse announces his {{testament}} of crime. After the film's release, director Fritz Lang felt <b>these</b> supernatural <b>scenes</b> {{should not}} have been included.|$|R
5|$|The next {{scenes were}} the El Rancho nightclub scenes {{and the scene}} in which Susan {{attempts}} suicide. Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give her voice a harsh, raspy tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.|$|E
5|$|The scenes Ubisoft removed depict anal probing by {{aliens and}} the player-character {{performing}} an abortion. In their place, the game displays a still {{image of a}} statue holding its face in its hand, with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} {{connection}} between Terra and Riku, scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra's perspective {{were added to the}} game, though Nomura has stated that <b>these</b> <b>scenes</b> are not of a precognitive nature. Nomura expects that in future games, {{the connection between}} both of them would be expanded. Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, resonating sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} automatically learning an activity-based semantic scene model from a stream of video data. A scene model is proposed that labels regions according an identifiable activity in each region, such as entry/exit zones, junctions, paths and stop zones. We present several unsupervised methods that learn <b>these</b> <b>scene</b> elements and present results that show the efficiency of our approach. Finally, we describe how the models {{can be used to}} support the interpretation of moving objects in a visual surveillance environment...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to behaviour recognition in visual surveillance under which scene events corresponding to object behaviours are modelled as groups of affiliated autonomous pixel-level events automatically detected using Pixel Change Histories (PCHs). The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is employed to cluster these pixel-level events into semantically more meaningful blob-level scene events, with automatic model order selection using modified Minimum Description Length (MDL). The method is computationally efficient allowing for real-time performance. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of recognising <b>these</b> <b>scene</b> events without object trajectory matching...|$|R
