25|$|A {{limiting}} factor in Yucatán's economy was <b>the</b> <b>poorness</b> of the limestone soil, which could only support crops {{for two to}} three years with land cleared through slash and burn (swidden) agriculture. Access to water was a {{limiting factor}} on agriculture, with the limestone escarpment giving way in water filled sinkholes (cenotes), but rivers and streams were generally absent on the peninsula. Individuals had rights to land so long as they cleared and tilled them and when the soil was exhausted, they repeated the process. In general Indians lived in a dispersed pattern, which Spanish congregación or forced resettlement attempted to alter. Collective labor cultivated the confraternities' lands, which included raising the traditional maize, beans, and cotton. But confraternities also later pursued cattle ranching, as well as mule and horse breeding, depending on the local situation. There is evidence that cofradías in southern Campeche were involved in interregional trade in cacao as well as cattle ranching. Although generally the revenues from crops and animals were devoted to expenses in the spiritual sphere, cofradías' cattle were used for direct aid to community members during droughts, stabilizing the community's food supply.|$|E
2500|$|During the Battle of the Trench, the Jewish {{tribe of}} Banu Qurayza who were {{located at the}} south of Medina were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged Banu Qurayza, the {{remaining}} major Jewish tribe in Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men, apart from a few who converted to Islam, were beheaded, while all {{the women and children}} were enslaved. In dealing with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, Arab historians and biographers have explained it as [...] "the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old." [...] F.E. Peters, a western scholar of Islam, states that Muhammad's treatment of Jews of Medina was essentially political being prompted by what Muhammad read as treasonous and not some transgression of the law of God. Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations according to Peters also existed since <b>the</b> <b>poorness</b> of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad. Peters argues that Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina was [...] "quite extraordinary", [...] "matched by nothing in the Qur'an", and is [...] "quite at odds with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina." [...] According to Welch, Muhammad's treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis. He adds that some Jews from other families were, however, allowed to remain in Medina.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Adhoc Networks (MANETs) are an {{emerging}} area of mobile computing. There are various challenges that are faced in adhoc environment. These are mostly due to <b>the</b> resource <b>poorness</b> of these networks. They are usually {{set up in}} situations of emergency, for temporary operations or simply {{if there are no}} resources to set up elaborate networks. Adhoc networks therefore throw up new requirements and problems in all areas of networking. The solutions for conventional networks are usually not sufficient to provide efficient adhoc operations. The wireless nature of communication and lack of any security infrastructure raise several security problems. With little protection against tampering, nodes are susceptible to compromise. Thus the networks are vulnerable to DOS attacks through compromised nodes or intruders. Many denial of service type of attacks are possible in the MANET and one of these type attacks is flooding attack in which malicious node sends the useless packets to consume the valuable network resources. Flooding attack is possible in all most all on demand routing protocol. Thus the paper introduces an opportunistic routing technique to forgo this instant attack. The opportunistic routing takes into account the relative velocity rather than the distance between nodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of pine afforestation on the species diversity of plant communities on ultramafic substrate {{was investigated in}} an area of Tuscany, central Italy, by means of species-area relationships, plant unit area, the Gini coefficient and the pattern of the index of Jaccard in relation to plot size. The species-area relationship was found to best fit the semilogarithmic model. Contrary to the available data for temperate ecosystems, tree canopy cover was found to increase the α-diversity of the understorey vegetation and its cover. The nutrient input due to the pine canopy caused an increase in the abundance of the grass Festuca inops - which was already present in the community - and subsequently the spread of several grassland species leading to a reduction in dominance concentration and to the formation of a species-rich grassland. The pine cover caused a decrease in floristic resemblance between plots, especially when the canopy cover is scattered. The increase in species richness found under the pine canopy, where the metal content in the soil is higher, suggests that potentially toxic metals are not the most limiting factor in Tuscan ultramafic soils. <b>The</b> typical <b>poorness</b> of vegetation on ultramafic soils should be first of all related to hydrological and nutritional stresses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Ad-hoc {{networks}} {{are a new}} paradigm of wireless communication for mobile hosts. There are various challenges that are faced in the Ad-hoc environment. These are mostly due to <b>the</b> resource <b>poorness</b> of these networks. They are usually set up in situations of emergency, for temporary operations or simply {{if there are no}} resources to set up elaborate networks. Ad-hoc networks therefore throw up new requirements and problems in all areas of networking. The solutions for conventional {{networks are}} usually not sufficient to provide efficient Ad-hoc operations. The wireless nature of communication and lack of any security infrastructure raise several security problems. One of the important issue is that an ad hoc wireless network permits wireless mobile nodes to communicate without prior infrastructure. Due to the limited range of each wireless node, communication sessions between two nodes are usually established through a number of intermediate nodes. Unfortunately, some of these intermediate nodes might be malicious, forming a threat to the security or confidentiality of exchanged data. While data encryption can protect the content exchanged between nodes, analysis of communication patterns may reveal valuable information about end users and their relationships. Using anonymous paths for communication provides security and privacy against traffic analysis. To establish these anonymous paths, all nodes build a global view of the network by exchanging routing information. In this paper we focus on Ad hoc routing and we present a secure anonymous route discovery protocol for Ad hoc routing in Ad hoc wireless networks...|$|R
