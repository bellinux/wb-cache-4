2500|$|Ms. Splosion Man was {{announced}} December 3, 2010 via {{a press release}} and teaser trailer. [...] "I think with Splosion Man a follow up was something {{we really wanted to}} do, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> never saw DLC for that game. We could have churned out new levels, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't just want to do Splosion Man 2, it had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we decided to do MSM," [...] stated Josh Bear of Twisted Pixel Games. [...] The team chose a female variation on 'Splosion Man as an homage to Ms. Pac-Man, which, according to Bear, the game pays homage to. [...] Bear continued by explaining that as Ms. Pac-Man was an improvement on Pac-Man so Ms. Splosion Man is meant to be an advancement on Splosion Man. [...] He stated the goal was to ensure that the game [...] "stands out on its own as a much bigger and better game overall, not to be confused as an over-priced DLC pack which I think a lot of retail [...] "sequels" [...] can be a lot of the time." [...] The game runs on Twisted Pixel's BEARD engine, which has been used to power all of their titles.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Rachel, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> care {{nothing for}} men as other women do, but dream dreams {{and talk with}} spirits. But what of it?" ...|$|E
