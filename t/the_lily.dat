5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} <b>The</b> <b>Lily,</b> announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E

5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like <b>the</b> <b>lily</b> have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lilies</b> of <b>the</b> Field is a 1962 semi-fictional {{novel by}} William Edmund Barrett {{that is based}} on the true story of the Sisters of Walburga.

50|$|Dracunculus vulgaris is {{a species}} of aroid in the genus Dracunculus and is known {{variously}} as the common dracunculus, dragon arum, the black arum, <b>the</b> voodoo <b>lily,</b> <b>the</b> snake <b>lily,</b> <b>the</b> stink <b>lily,</b> <b>the</b> black dragon, <b>the</b> black <b>lily,</b> dragonwort, and ragons. In Greece, part of its native range, the plant is called drakondia, the long spadix being viewed as a small dragon hiding in the spathe.|$|R

5|$|Nada (May 1894 – May 19, 1896), Burnham's daughter, was {{the first}} white child born in Bulawayo; she died of fever and {{starvation}} during the town's siege. She was buried three days later in the town's Pioneer Cemetery, plot No.144. Nada is the Zulu word for lily and she was named after the heroine in Sir H. Rider Haggard's Zulu tale, Nada <b>the</b> <b>Lily</b> (1892). Three of Haggard's books are dedicated to Burnham's daughter, Nada: The Wizard (1896), Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe (1899), and Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll (1900).|$|E
5|$|The Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association {{was founded}} in 1851 by {{important}} suffrage leaders such as Agnes Cook, Mary B. Birdsall, Amanda M. Way, and Mary F. Thomas. With the exception of Way, all these women {{were the first to}} address the Indiana State Legislature on January 19, 1859, with petitions calling for women's suffrage, temperance, and equal rights. In 1854 Birdsall had purchased <b>The</b> <b>Lily,</b> the first U.S. newspaper edited by and for women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, and moved it to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's suffrage and rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned to his left. The words beneath <b>the</b> <b>lily</b> (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that they}} are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not take}} his hand. Her eyes, turned sideways, glinted; her teeth were {{fastened}} on her lower lip. She dropped <b>the</b> <b>lilies,</b> suddenly looked up at him, gulped, and slunk away. In passing she had smeared <b>the</b> <b>lilies</b> with her foot.|$|R
50|$|A {{major theme}} in <b>The</b> <b>Lily's</b> Revenge is love and marriage. This {{is in part}} due to the {{inspiration}} of <b>the</b> play. <b>The</b> <b>Lily's</b> Revenge was written as a response to anti-gay marriage agendas. The play also discusses themes of tradition and nostalgia, which are two strategies that anti-gay marriage agendas use as a defense. Through the structure of the play and through the audience participation during both the acts and intermissions, Mac explores the theme of the Soul of Theatre. An additional theme that Mac explores is, through <b>the</b> <b>Lily's</b> journey, <b>the</b> Hero's Journey.|$|R

5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward {{intended to be a}} star vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, <b>The</b> <b>Lily</b> of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of the}} year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E
5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly {{on the surface of the}} central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath <b>the</b> <b>lily,</b> in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and <b>the</b> <b>lily,</b> with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow flower of the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E

25|$|The Republican Party in {{the state}} {{suffered}} a substantial loss in voters due to the disfranchisement measures. Jones {{became involved in the}} struggle between <b>the</b> <b>Lily</b> Whites and the Black and Tans within the Republican Party. In 1902, Jones helped organize a slate of black Republicans to challenge <b>the</b> <b>Lily</b> Whites and Democrats in the city of Little Rock general election. The struggle reached a breaking point in 1920, when the blacks nominated J.H. Blount, a Negro candidate, for Governor for the first time. In that year, Jones was selected as the Black and Tan contender for the Arkansas Republican National Committee. Four years later, Jones, J. H. Blount, N. R. Parker and J. Hibbler helped organize a Black and Tan protest meeting in Little Rock in which a list of demands for equal political treatment was presented to <b>the</b> <b>Lily</b> Whites. Eventually, a compromise was reached that guaranteed black representation on the Republican State Central Committee.|$|E
