Following delivery in September 1957, it was subjected to extensive testing, both in the Rugby <b>test</b> <b>plant</b> and on service trains. After {{the completion of the}} tests in February 1958, it was decided to fit all 9Fs built subsequently with double blastpipes and chimneys; these were numbers 92183 onwards, also 92165–7. The modification was also installed on 92000/1/2/5 and 92006. This allowed the engines to steam slightly more freely and thus generate higher power ranges.|$|E

On 2 December 1905 Norsk Hydro-Elektrisk Kvælstofaktieselskab (now Norsk Hydro) was founded, and plans to start a new plant in Rjukan were initialized; moving closer to the source of power would improve efficiency and not make it possible for the newly independent Government of Norway to hinder construction of hydroelectric power by foreign investors—a major political issue at the time. Rjukanfos applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Notodden, but on 18 June 1907 the Norwegian Parliament did not accept the application, despite an offer from Eyde that the state would receive escheat after eighty years, in part because the state would have to guarantee [...] for the project.|$|E

The young {{actively}} growing seedling of the common weeds were uprooted and taken to the laboratory for analyses.

Root exudates of Crotalaria breviflora Crotalaria juncea Crotalaria retusa and Crotalaria spectabilis exhibited nematicidal properties against the Meloidogyne incognita. The effects varied with concentrations of the exudates P 0. 05 using analysis of variance ANOVA. The effects also differed among <b>test</b> <b>plants</b> with Crotalaria retusa topping in terms of reduction in nematode population.

The production Q2 locomotives were of 4-4-6-4 arrangement; they were the largest non-articulated locomotives ever built and the most powerful locomotives ever static tested, producing [...] on the PRR's static <b>test</b> <b>plant.</b> The Q2 locomotives were also the most powerful steam locomotive ever constructed with ten driving wheels. In operation, the Q2 could outperform pre-existing freight engines hauling the double the tonnage of their predecessors. Furthermore, the Q2 had no problems building up steam power and was known to be a very smooth riding engine. 26 of them were built at PRR's Altoona Works and they were by far the most successful duplex type. The duplex propensity to slip was combated by an automatic slip control mechanism that reduced power to the slipping unit. The slip control mechanism wasn't always responsive and its complexity often lead to maintenance crews not wanting to bother with it during overhauls.|$|E

Few experimental studies with wild grass—endophyte symbiota, compared to endophyte-infected agricultural grasses, have tested for anti-insect benefits, let alone for resistance against more than one insect species. This study quantified the preference and performance of the bird cherry oat-aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), two important pests of forage and cereal grasses, on Neotyphodium-infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants of the wild grass Alpine timothy, Phleum alpinum L. (Poales: Poaceae). The experiments tested for both constitutive and wound-induced resistance in E+ plants to characterize possible plasticity of defense responses by a wild E+ grass.
