5000|$|Its {{fuselage}} was conventional, {{with flat}} sides and rounded decking. The nose-mounted single engine was of very low power, only [...] Two open cockpits were arranged in tandem, both over the wing. Aft of the trailing edge root {{the bottom of}} the fuselage rose strongly to carry a tall, broad fin and rudder. The X-112 had a T-tail, carrying elevators. Its thick airfoil wings were low mounted, each with a <b>tip</b> <b>float</b> which, in combination with the strong anhedral kept the fuselage well clear of the water surface. Each float carried a steeply sloped short aileron for roll control. A retractable water-rudder, fuselage mounted at {{the point at which the}} lower fuselage rose upwards, provided directional control on the water surface.|$|E

40|$|The {{preliminary}} tests described here {{were made to}} determine the extent to which wing <b>tip</b> <b>floating</b> ailerons might be effective in reducing airplane spinning tendencies. The tests showed that initial spinning tendencies and rates of stable spinning could doubtless be reduced by the use of <b>tip</b> <b>floating</b> ailerons on an airplane. It also appears to be desirable to reduce to a minimum the interference between wing and aileron. This would serve to maintain uniformity of action at all angles of attack and enable calculation of the aileron characteristics...|$|R
50|$|The design {{incorporates}} some innovative features, including wing <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> that retract {{into the}} wing tips and provide additional wing area and lift, a nose wheel that retracts into the nose {{to act as}} a bumper for mooring on water and drooping ailerons.|$|R
50|$|The E-2 used {{a wooden}} hull with {{aluminum}} cladding. The aircraft used a parasol wing supported by large V-struts with secondary lower shoulder wings with <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> at the ends. The single engine was {{mounted in the}} center of the wing root of the upper wing with a rear teardrop fairing.|$|R
50|$|The Teal design {{features}} a high wing with <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> for lateral stability. The boxer engine is mounted tractor fashion in a strut-supported pylon above the wing root.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is of all-wooden construction, {{with its}} wings covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its 10.7 m span wing employs an RSG 36 airfoil, mounts Junkers ailerons {{and has a}} wing area of 15.515 m2. The aircraft does not use <b>tip</b> <b>floats,</b> but instead relies on sponsons for balance in the water. The acceptable power range is [...] and the standard engines used are the [...] Rotax 447 or the [...] Rotax 503 two-stroke powerplants.|$|R
50|$|The EO was an open-cockpit aluminum-hulled biplane {{seaplane}} with {{a single}} tractor engine center mounted in a nacelle on the top wing which also housed the fuel tank and oil tank. The upper wing was staggered well forward of the lower wing. The wings were constructed with spruce I-beam spars and ribs with aircraft fabric covering. The hull was built with four watertight compartments. The <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> were all-aluminum. A cross-through tube accepted a wheel assembly for ground movement.|$|R
50|$|The Flywhale, built {{mainly from}} {{composite}} materials, is a flying boat style amphibian, {{with a single}} step hull and sponsons rather than wing <b>tip</b> <b>floats.</b> It accommodates two in side-by-side seating fitted with dual control. The design also provides room for two people {{to sleep in the}} fuselage. A large, one-piece canopy hinges forward for access and there are separate, removable side windows. Behind the seats is a baggage area. The Flywhale has short-legged, tricycle landing gear with mainwheels retracting backwards into the sponsons. It can operate on land, water and snow-civered surfaces.|$|R
50|$|In late September {{or early}} October 1992 a final variant, the Hydroplum bis or Hydroplum Ia, was flown. This, the Hydroplum {{prototype}} reworked, has wings cropped by 1 m (39 in), wing <b>tip</b> <b>floats,</b> an integrated water rudder and tailwheel and spoilers {{moved from the}} rear {{to the front of}} the wing spar to improve their efficiency. The smaller span raised the maximum speed from 110 km/h (68 mph) to 130 km/h (81 mph), but also increased stalling speed and landing run. Tisserand flew it until November 1992, then sold it.|$|R
40|$|Discussed {{here are}} a series of {{systematic}} tests being conducted to compare different lateral control devices with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack. The present tests were made with six different forms of <b>floating</b> <b>tip</b> ailerons of symmetrical section. The tests showed the effect of the various ailerons on the general performance characteristics of the wing, and on the lateral controllability and stability characteristics. In addition, the hinge moments were measured for the most interesting cases. The results are compared with those for a rectangular wing with ordinary ailerons and also with those for a rectangular wing having full-chord <b>floating</b> <b>tip</b> ailerons. Practically all the <b>floating</b> <b>tip</b> ailerons gave satisfactory rolling moments at all angles of attack {{and at the same time}} gave no adverse yawing moments of appreciable magnitude. The general performance characteristics with the <b>floating</b> <b>tip</b> ailerons, however, were relatively poor, especially the rate of climb. None of the <b>floating</b> <b>tip</b> ailerons entirely eliminated the auto rotational moments at angles of attack above the stall, but all of them gave lower moments than a plain wing. Some of the floating ailerons fluttered if given sufficiently large deflection, but this could have been eliminated by moving the hinge axis of the ailerons forward. Considering all points including hinge moments, the <b>floating</b> <b>tip</b> ailerons on the wing with 5 : 1 taper are probably the best of those which were tested...|$|R
50|$|The fuselage, a {{two step}} hull design, is a {{fibreglass}} structure on all models with the glazed cabin {{well below the}} wing underside. The two seat Che-24 and Che-26 have the same length, side by side seats and upward opening doors. The Che-29 is 400 mm longer and has a second pair of seats behind the first. Fixed wing <b>tip</b> <b>floats,</b> each mounted on parallel pairs of struts, provide stability on water where a water rudder under the fin is used for manoeuvring. All types {{have the option of}} an amphibious conventional undercarriage; the small mainwheels are on short cantilever legs which can be rotated upwards out of the water.|$|R
50|$|The AMC was a two-bay biplane {{flying boat}} with an {{aluminum}} hull. The spruce woodspar wings were fabric covered with small <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> for stability. The engine was mounted {{just below the}} top wing in a pusher configuration with a forward-mounted radiator. Two 50-gallon streamlined main fuel tanks sat on the top wing {{on either side of}} the engine with a 70-gallon fuselage-mounted reserve. The hull was constructed of eighteen forms and five watertight bulkheads. It had two rows of small bench seats for passengers in the front. The pilot and mechanic sat slightly raised in individual open cockpits behind the passengers, beneath the main wing. The hull used Alcoa 17S aluminum treated with potassium nitrate with Canton flannel/Asphalt watertight seals and Valspar aluminum paint.|$|R
5000|$|Preliminary taxying {{trials were}} {{undertaken}} with outriggers to support <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> {{in place of}} the wings and with an [...] Gnome. These were generally satisfactory, although there was a tendency for the nose to dip when the airscrew was engaged: to counteract this a supplementary front-mounted elevator was added. The Gnome was then replaced by the Canton-Unné and the wings fitted, but before flight testing could begin the aircraft was grounded on a sandbank, necessitating extensive repairs. At this point Bristol asked the Admiralty for more substantial support: this was refused and so the program was abandoned. The X.3 was returned to Filton, where it was eventually scrapped in 1920. [...] Burney was to exploit his experience with the X.2 and X.3 in developing the paravane at HMS Vernon during 1915.|$|R
50|$|The Akoya's {{fuselage}} {{is pointed}} at the nose and almost circular at its greatest diameter. In elevation it has a curved underside and, above, the large one piece canopy over the side-by-side, dual control cabin forms an unbroken line with the fuselage. There is an electrically operated retractable undercarriage of the taildragger variety, with the main gear legs rotating backward and inwards into the fuselage, and the tailwheel arm rotating forward. All wheels have hydraulic brakes. Operation from water, without a planing bottom or floats, is performed undercarriage up on the round fuselage underside {{with the aid of}} a pair of fixed hydrofoils, called shark-fins, sharply tapered planes set at about 50° to the vertical just outboard of the mainwheels. Small <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> are an option for better lateral stability on water. The Akoya, it is claimed by the manufacturer, can also land on snow, though skis are an option.|$|R
50|$|The {{intention}} {{was that the}} flying boat hull would be constructed from four panels of PVC foam covered {{on both sides with}} fiberglass at the factory, with the builder just epoxying them together around pre-formed bulkheads. The landing gear was to consist of a retractable tricycle gear, with the main gear swiveling aft and nose wheel retracting forward to act as a docking bumper on the nose. The landing gear main wheel design included disc brakes. The planing hull featured a normal step cut out and Schreder indicated that if this was shown to create too much drag during flight testing that he would design a retractable fairing for it. His {{intention was}} to have retractable <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> that would swing outboard to form wing tips in flight {{in the same manner as}} on the Consolidated PBY Catalina, which Schreder had flown during the Second World War.|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests were}} made of a 1 / 25 scale model of the Martin JRM- 1 {{airplane}} to determine: (1) The longitudinal stability and control characteristics of the JRM- 1 model near the water and lateral and directional stability characteristics with power while moving {{on the surface of}} the water, the latter being useful for the design of tip floats; (2) The stability and stalling characteristics of the wing with a modified airfoil contour; (3) Stability characteristics of a hull of larger design gross weight; The test results indicated that the elevator was powerful enough to trim the original model in a landing configuration at any lift coefficient within the specified range of centers of gravity. The ground-board tests for evaluating the aerodynamic forces and moments on an airplane in a simulated cross wind indicate a high dihedral effect in the presence of the ground board and, consequently, during low-speed taxying and take-off, large overturning moments would result which would have to be overcome by the <b>tip</b> <b>floats...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many {{amphibian}} {{aircraft are}} of the flying boat type. These aircraft, and those designed as floatplanes with a single main float under the fuselage centerline (such as the Loening OL and Grumman J2F), require outrigger floats to provide lateral stability {{so as to avoid}} dipping a wingtip, which can destroy an aircraft if it happens at speed, or can cause the wingtip to fill with water and sink if stationary. While these impose weight and drag, amphibious aircraft also face the possibility of these getting hit when operating from a runway. A common solution is to make them retractable as those found on the Consolidated Catalina however these are even heavier than fixed floats. Some aircraft may have the <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> removed for extended use from land. Other amphibians, such as the Dornier Seastar use stub wings called sponsons, mounted with their own lower surfaces nearly even with the ventral [...] "boat-hull" [...] shaped fuselage surface to provide the needed stability, while floatplane amphibians usually avoid the problem by dividing their buoyancy requirements between two floats, much like a catamaran.|$|R
5000|$|This is a perennial, rhizomatous herb {{producing}} narrow, compressed, unspotted stems to {{a maximum}} length of about 1 m. The stems are either unbranched or sparingly branched. It has two types of leaf. The submersed leaves are sessile 5-25 cm long and 0.1-1 cm wide, translucent, linear in shape and ribbonlike, red-brown to light green in colour with a blunt to acute <b>tip.</b> The <b>floating</b> leaves {{are similar to the}} floating leaves of other Potamogeton, petiolate and opaque, up to 8 centimeters long and 3 wide.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its wing mounts downturned wing <b>tips</b> that incorporate <b>floats</b> for water operations. The standard engine used is the [...] Rotax 914 four-stroke turbocharged powerplant. The highly swept fin mounts the tailplane high, in a nearly T-tailed configuration. The hull incorporates a built-in step.|$|R
5000|$|The P6M-2 was an {{impressive}} aircraft; its Mach 0.9 (1,100 km/h) performance [...] "on the deck" [...] could be equaled by few aircraft of the time. The aircraft were heavily built, with the skin at the wing roots over 1 in thick. The normally docile and pleasant handling {{characteristics of the}} P6M-1 were replaced by some severe compressibility effects above Mach 0.8. These included rapid changes in directional trim, severe buffeting, and wing drop requiring high control inputs to counter. Until those problems were fixed, the P6M-2 could not be considered {{for use by the}} Fleet. The problems were identified as being caused by the larger engine nacelles required for the J75s. There were also problems on the water, including a tendency for the <b>tip</b> <b>floats</b> to dig in under certain situations, and engine surges. These problems were eventually solved, but time had run out just as the first crews were training for its operational debut. Eisenhower's administration was making major defense budget cuts that forced the Navy to make choices. In August 1959 Martin was told to halt operations and the program was about to be canceled. Seaplanes were a small community in Naval Aviation, and the P6M was significantly over budget and behind schedule and competing with aircraft carriers for funding. The Navy also had a potentially superior system for the nuclear strike role, the Ballistic Missile Submarine.|$|R

40|$|Samples {{of primary}} root tissue of corn (Zea mays L.) were aged either in CaSO 4 {{solution}} or in humid air, {{after which they}} were immersed for 10 minutes in a solution containing 0. 1 mm 86 RbCl. Aging in solution, but not in humid air, enhanced the subsequent rate of Rb+ absorption. Excision of roots before aging was followed by greater enhancement than when exicision followed aging. The time course of aging of 1 -cm segments from different portions of the root showed decreasing response with increasing distance from the root cap. The aging response of apical segments (5 - 15 mm from the root cap) could be detected within 10 minutes and usually reached a maximum within 2 hours. Rb+ absorption by apical segments (5 - 15 mm) aged without the tip (0 - 5 mm) was more than double that by apical segments whose tips were left attached {{until the end of}} the aging period. When apical segments without the tip were aged for 2 hours in the CaSO 4 solution in which seedlings had previously been grown for 24 hours, the rate of absorption was only 63 % of samples aged in fresh solution. When apical segments were aged for 2 hours in fresh solution containing excised <b>tips</b> <b>floating</b> free in the solution, the rate of Rb+ absorption was 20 % less than in samples aged in solution containing no excised tips. The data presented in this study are interpreted to indicate that a water-soluble metabolite, originating in the root tip and translocated basipetally, inhibits Rb accumulation...|$|R
50|$|The Hydroplum II is an unequal span, single bay biplane with V-from interplane struts. The fabric covered {{wings are}} again of {{constant}} chord and square tipped, though the lower wing has wing <b>tip,</b> retractable <b>floats.</b> The upper wing spoilers were {{moved from the}} main spar to the trailing edge, mounted on false spars. The fuselage was widened to accommodate two side-by-side in an open cockpit and refined aft, under a revised pylon which now rose from a rounded, raised upper fairing.

5000|$|Banana Technology does {{away with}} this “dead zone” by {{reversing}} the snowboard’s camber between the rider's feet; rather than arcing upward, like traditionally cambered boards, those with Banana Technology arc downwards, allowing the board to rest on its center when placed on a flat surface. As Saari puts it, “Banana Technology focuses edge pressure between your feet, bringing the dead zone to life. It adds catch free tips and tails for jibs, rails, and forgiving landings. It adds pre-bent rocker between your feet for edge hold and carving, and it adds <b>tip</b> and tail <b>float</b> in powder." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Mussel II {{also spent}} time as both landplane and seaplane. [...] Until March 1930 both Mussels had used {{what was in}} the UK at least the {{standard}} two float configuration. In that month a single long central float arrangement, similar to one built by Shorts for a de Havilland Gipsy Moth the previous summer. The single <b>float</b> required wing <b>tip</b> stabilising <b>floats,</b> and these were strutted to the outer wing and braced with another pair of struts inboard, meeting the underside of the wing at the same point as the wing compression struts above, so running almost co-linearly with them and giving a shallow cross like look to the aircraft from the front. [...] In its original form this undercarriage was amphibious, with main wheels mounted on a streamlined cross piece on the float, as on the Moth. [...] The main axle could be rotated from the cockpit by turning a handwheel and hence raising or lowering the mainwheels. [...] The water rudder on the float was reinforced to act as a small tailskid for use on land.|$|R
