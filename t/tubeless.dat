Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the <b>tubeless</b> LCD and plasma sets.|$|E

He attempted to return to France in 1685 but the revocation of the Edict of Nantes precluded this move. His father died in 1687, and he inherited Hofwijck, which he made his home the following year.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his life, Hevelius took {{a leading}} part in {{municipal}} administration, becoming town councillor in 1651; but from 1639 on, his chief interest was astronomy. In 1641 he built an observatory on {{the roofs of}} his three connected houses, equipping it with splendid instruments, ultimately including a large Keplerian telescope of [...] focal length, [...] with a wood and wire tube he constructed himself. This {{may have been the}} longest [...] "tubed" [...] telescope before the advent of the <b>tubeless</b> aerial telescope.|$|E
2500|$|Balloon tires became {{available}} in 1925. They were [...] all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible – typically [...] – giving a softer ride. The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so [...] (rim diameter) × [...] (tire width) wheels has {{about the same}} outer diameter as 30 in (76cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an inner tube to hold the pressurized air; <b>tubeless</b> tires were not generally in use until much later.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1675 the {{brothers}} Christiaan and Constantine Huygens decided {{to accommodate the}} very long focal length objectives they were creating by eliminating the tube altogether. In the Huygens' [...] "aerial" [...] telescope the objective was mounted inside a short iron tube mounted on a swiveling ball-joint {{on top of an}} adjustable mast. The eyepiece was mounted in another short tube (sometimes on a stand), and the two tubes were kept aligned by a taut connecting string. Christiaan Huygens published designs for these <b>tubeless</b> [...] "aerial telescopes" [...] in his 1684 book Astroscopia Compendiaria, and their invention has been attributed to him and his brother Constantijn, although similar designs were also used by Adrien Auzout; the idea is even sometimes attributed to Christopher Wren.|$|E
50|$|French tire {{manufacturer}} Hutchinson {{has introduced}} a <b>tubeless</b> wheel system, Road <b>Tubeless,</b> that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System <b>Tubeless)</b> that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road <b>Tubeless</b> rims, like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road <b>Tubeless</b> rim {{is similar to the}} hook bead of a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road <b>Tubeless</b> tire, creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tubeless</b> {{tires are}} {{primarily}} used on mountain bikes {{due to their}} ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats. <b>Tubeless</b> tires work similarly to clinchers in that the bead of the tire is specifically designed to interlock into a corresponding <b>tubeless</b> rim, but without an inner tube. Air is inflated directly into the tire, and once [...] "locked" [...] into the rim, the system is airtight. Liquid sealants are often injected into <b>tubeless</b> tires to prevent punctures. Pinch flats are impossible in a <b>tubeless</b> setup because there is no tube to pinch; however, air can escape if the bead lock is compromised from too much lateral force on the tire or deformation of the rim/tire due to hard impact with an object. <b>Tubeless</b> technology has progressed significantly over the last few years, and road-specific <b>tubeless</b> technologies for narrow tires are now gaining popularity.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Shimano and Hutchinson {{introduced}} a <b>tubeless</b> system for road bicycles. <b>Tubeless</b> tires {{have not yet}} gained popular acceptance in road racing {{due to lack of}} sponsorship, the tradition of using tubular tires and the fact that, even without the innertube, the combined weight of <b>tubeless</b> rims and tires is more than top-of-the-line tubular tire wheelsets. Road <b>tubeless</b> is gaining popularity among riders for whom the benefits are worth the costs.|$|E
50|$|The UST (Universal System <b>Tubeless)</b> <b>tubeless</b> design {{eliminates}} {{an inner}} tube, which allows lower inflation pressures as {{the threat of}} pinch flats is eliminated.|$|E

Forged out of Northern California’s punishing Sierra Buttes region and born from the need for competitively light yet ruggedly consistent and durable <b>tubeless</b> products, TCS tires, rims, and wheels formed an international standards-based system. TCS combined the precision of UST specifications with the low rotational weights of <b>tubeless</b> ready, non-standards-based formats. In 2012 WTB became the first tire company to gain sealant-tubeless certification. Now a globally accepted system, WTB TCS has proven that standards-based design yields consistency and competitive weights.|$|E
5000|$|Tires {{also come}} with tubes, <b>tubeless</b> and tubeless-ready. Tires with tubes are the {{standard}} {{design and the}} easiest to use and maintain. <b>Tubeless</b> tires often have better performance because you can run them at a lower tire pressure which results in better traction and increasing rolling resistance. Tubeless-ready tires are tires that can use tubes or go <b>tubeless.</b> A liquid sealant is used without the tube to secure the seal to the rim. [...] Popular tire manufacturers include Wilderness Trail Bikes, Schwalbe, Maxxis, Nokian, Michelin, Continental, Tioga, Kenda, Hutchinson Specialized and Panaracer.|$|E
