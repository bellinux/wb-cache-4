500|$|On April 22, TMZ.com {{reported}} that the tape was a hoax. They revealed that they had spoken {{to the person who}} modified the soundboard tapes, and the alleged culprit told them, [...] "It's a little bit crazy. No one in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> sound like that, and no one would cheer for someone singing like that." [...] The following day, Beyoncé spoke about the allegations to MTV News. She stated that the report was ridiculous and that the timing of the video would draw publicity to two of her upcoming television performances. In an interview with Chris Harris of Rolling Stone, Zeghibe said that he was surprised by how much attention the clip received and by Beyoncé's reaction to it. He admitted that he had previously given the same treatment to Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, and that he did not feel he had to apologize for the hoax: ...|$|E

I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

5000|$|The only {{export of}} NowWhat is the NowWhattian boghog skin, {{which no one}} in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds</b> <b>would</b> want to buy because it's thin and very leaky, and the export trade only manages to survive because of the {{significant}} {{number of people in}} the Galaxy who are not in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds.</b> In fact, one of the lingering questions on NowWhat is how the boghogs manage to stay warm in their skins. It says [...] "if anyone had wanted to learn the language of the boghogs, they would have discovered that they don't and are just as cold and miserable as everyone else". It also mentions that no one wanted to, because the boghogs communicate by biting each other very hard on the thigh.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the trio}} reach the island, Cicero {{launches}} into {{an examination of}} law. He begins by saying that law does not, and cannot, begin with men. Men, to him, are the instruments of a higher wisdom which governs the entire earth and has the power, through shared morality, to command good or forbid evil. Cicero also makes a distinction in this section between legalism (actual written law) and law (right and wrong as dictated by the eternal wisdom). To Cicero, human laws can be good or ill depending on whether they are {{in sync with the}} eternal, natural law. A law enacted for a purely temporary or local purpose is law, according to him, by dint of public approval. It has force of law only so long as people observe it and the state enforces it. Natural law, however, needs no encoding, no enforcement. By way of example, Cicero mentions that when Sextus Tarquinius, son of King Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, raped Lucretia, there were no laws in Rome governing rape. However, even then, the populace knew viscerally that what had happened was against shared morality, and followed Lucius Junius Brutus to correct matters. Evil laws, or ones that go against the eternal law, further, do not deserve the title, and states that enact them to the exclusion of the eternal law do not deserve the title states. To demonstrate, Cicero uses the analogy of unschooled people or quacks passing themselves off as doctors and prescribing deadly treatments. No one in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>mind,</b> Cicero argues, <b>would</b> dare call such treatments [...] "medicine" [...] or their practitioners [...] "doctors".|$|R

60|$|And here a {{few words}} must be said to persons with whose {{difficulties}} I deeply sympathise, but from whose conclusions I differ utterly: those, namely, who say that if we reject the miracles of these saints' lives, we must reject also the miracles of the New Testament. The answer is, as I believe, that the Apostles and Evangelists were sane men: men in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds,</b> wise, calm; conducting themselves (save {{in the matter of}} committing sins) like other human beings, as befitted the disciples of that Son of Man who came eating and drinking, and was therefore called by the ascetics of his time a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber: whereas these monks were not (as I have said elsewhere) in <b>their</b> <b>right</b> <b>minds</b> at all.|$|R
