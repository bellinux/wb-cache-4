Darwin Martin purchased the land in 1902. Construction began in 1903, and completed with Wright signing off on the project in 1907. The original complete Martin House Complex was 29080ft2 (2700m2).|$|E
25|$|William Gear – {{a student}} of Fernand Léger and the only British member of the avant-garde CoBrA {{movement}} – had close links with Birmingham, exhibiting with the Birmingham Artists Committee and forming links with the Birmingham Surrealists in the 1940s, before finally moving {{to the city to}} teach at the School of Art in 1964. Later that decade John Salt's obsessively detailed paintings of cars and mobile homes in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> made him the only major English artist among the pioneers of photorealism.|$|E
50|$|In October 2000, NPS and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Society of <b>Landscape</b> Architects {{established}} a sister program, <b>the</b> Historic <b>American</b> <b>Landscapes</b> Survey, to systematically document historic <b>American</b> <b>landscapes.</b> A predecessor, <b>the</b> Historic <b>American</b> <b>Landscape</b> and Garden Project, recorded historic Massachusetts gardens between 1935 and 1940.

50|$|Throughout {{the course}} of his career, several key themes have {{characterized}} Kaish's work. In an interview with Ira Goldberg, Director of the Art Students League, Kaish identifies them: the urban architecture visible from his studio windows, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and <b>the</b> figure.|$|R
25|$|In 1912, the Dunsmuirs engaged <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> architects Franklin Brett and George D. Hall of Boston, {{students}} of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{to develop a}} landscape for the entire site. They prepared a classic design for an Edwardian park that included the overall layout for the entire property. The plan organized the estate into four distinct landscape zones, progressing {{from a series of}} nine formal 'garden rooms' near Hatley Castle, to recreational spaces, then to agricultural lands, and finally to the forest surrounding the estate.|$|E
25|$|Hudson River School {{paintings}} {{reflect the}} themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the 19th century. The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley {{just as it was}} coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School, while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.|$|E
500|$|The {{news of the}} Willey tragedy quickly {{spread across}} the nation. [...] During the ensuing years, it would become the subject of literature, drawings, local histories, {{scientific}} journals, and paintings. [...] One such example is the painting by Thomas Hill (18291908) titled Crawford Notch, {{the site of the}} Willey tragedy before the slide. The Willey disaster started a new awareness of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscape</b> and the raw wilderness of the White Mountains.|$|E

500|$|By 1990, {{the cost}} of the average U.S. film had passed [...] Of the nine films {{released}} that year to gross more than [...] at the U.S. box office, two would have been strictly B movie material before the late 1970s: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dick Tracy. Three more—the science-fiction thriller Total Recall, the action-filled detective thriller Die Hard 2, and the year's biggest hit, the slapstick kiddie comedy Home Alone—were also far closer to the traditional arena of the Bs than to classic A-list subject matter. The growing popularity of home video and access to unedited movies on cable and satellite television along with real estate pressures were making survival more difficult for the sort of small or non-chain theaters that were the primary home of independently produced genre films. Drive-in screens were rapidly disappearing from <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscape.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gibbons said he {{deliberately}} {{constructed the}} visual look of Watchmen {{so that each}} page would be identifiable {{as part of that}} particular series and [...] "not some other comic book". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with [...] "a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin" [...] which he hoped [...] "would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former surveyor for [...] "including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing". Gibbons described the series as [...] "a comic about comics". Gibbons felt that [...] "Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [...] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications." [...] The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>landscape,</b> such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, [...] "perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because {{he did not have to}} rely primarily on reference books.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier, in April 2003, the American Bible Society {{had already}} {{published}} an {{edition of the}} Bible titled [...] "The Holy Bible (Good News Translation/GNT): Armed Forces Edition" [...] which also had official military emblems {{on the front and}} back covers: the emblems of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chaplain Corps on the front, and the emblems of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard on the back. The ABS describes this work as [...] "A historic Military Bible developed with the Chiefs of Chaplains of the Armed Services. Easy to read and understand Good News Translation in Desert camouflage cover. Includes photos of military personnel from all branches, familiar hymns, inspirational quotations." [...] According to news reports, the practice of having chaplains distribute Bibles to those who desire them is a long-standing tradition in the military, but [...] "showing favoritism [...] toward a particular religion would constitute establishment." [...] Therefore, although this edition of the Bible includes a welcome letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains {{at the time it was}} published—Major General Gaylord T. Gunhus, United States Army, Rear Admiral Barry C. Black, United States Navy, and Lorraine K.
