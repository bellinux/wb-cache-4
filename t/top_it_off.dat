25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{completion}} of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner Daniel Burnham. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the École des Beaux-Arts and two years in Rome. To <b>top</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the World's Columbian Exposition, was a major proponent of the Beaux Arts movement, thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the École lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To <b>top</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

Backy Bain also of Idolator additionally gave the song a positive review stating [...] "We were a bit worried that Harujuku Barbie would forever be the garnish on other people’s tracks instead of the main dish, but this sweet song proves otherwise." [...] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard commented on Minaj toning it down stating, [...] "the Young Money rap princess puts the sleazy talk aside and finds herself smitten with a young man...

500|$|Thematically, {{both the}} stage {{set up and}} the {{wardrobe}} consisted of lots of roses and was an homage to the venue and the name [...] "Roseland". Starting from arriving at Roseland in a nude bodysuit and mask, embellished with red roses, the outfits worn on the stage included characteristic attire worn by Gaga in her previous live performances. One of the dresses consisted of purple colored hot pants, fishnets, and a mask, all covered with purple roses, along with a metallic purple jacket to <b>top</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Photographer Terry Richardson took photos of the backstage activities which revealed that a second purple jacket was also worn by Gaga and it was bejeweled and emblazoned with the word [...] "Gaga" [...] on the rear side. The instruments used by the singer, such as a keyboard, was also decked similarly with red roses. Another dress included shoulder spikes reminiscent of the singer's attire during her first studio album era, coupled with a hat made of black roses. A green colored wig was also worn by Gaga which she had introduced during the Artpop era. Gaga's vocal coach Don Lawrence, who began working {{with her when she}} was 13, assisted her before each show, either by being present there or through phone.

2500|$|Several episodes that {{centered}} on Itchy and Scratchy dealt with censorship issues. In the episode [...] "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge", Marge successfully forms a protest group that forces network to take Itchy and Scratchy off the air, citing the cartoon violence unsuitable for children. The episode was partially inspired by Terry Rakolta, who protested the Fox network over the show Married... with Children. When Itchy and Scratchy are cancelled, the kids of Springfield resort to {{playing in a}} wholesome manner. The montage was a satirical point by saying {{the opposite of what}} the writers believed. For the episode, which handles a large issue, the writers tried not to have a point of view and looked at both sides, despite what the writers personally felt. The episode [...] "Itchy & Scratchy Land" [...] was written as a response to new, more stringent censorship laws that had been put in place. As a result, the Fox network tried to stop the writers from including Itchy & Scratchy cartoons in episodes. In response, the writers created this episode, which they decided would be as violent as possible. The network threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when showrunner David Mirkin threatened to tell the media. Mirkin further tried to put [...] "as much blood and guts" [...] into the episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] as he could. He had received several complaints by the United States Congress about the amount of violence on the show and he did not like their attempt to censor it. The episode was later described as [...] "the most [...] disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] by Mirkin. The episode begins with Marge warning that the episode that is about to air has so much guts and violence that Congress will not let them show it. The three main segments are linked with Groundskeeper Willie being killed in all three of them. The first segment has Homer attempting to kill the rest of the family, the second segment has Homer killing anything and everything in the prehistoric past, and the final segment revolves around Springfield Elementary eating children.

Play metal! Pete began to write material for his yet unnamed metal band and quickly found his own style where he incorporated much melody in the guitars and <b>topped</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> with aggressive non-melodic vocals.
