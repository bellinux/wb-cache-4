40|$|The {{theory of}} {{embodied}} cognition can provide HCI practitioners and theorists {{with new ideas}} about interaction and new principles for better designs. I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes {{the way we think}} and perceive – tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than 3 by seeing – there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observa tion; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. <b>These</b> <b>four</b> <b>ideas</b> have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems...|$|E
40|$|Throughout biological, chemical, and {{pharmaceutical}} research,conformational searches {{are used to}} explore the possiblethree-dimensional configurations of molecules. This thesis describesa new systematic method for conformational search, including anapplication of the method to determining {{the structure of a}} peptidevia solid-state NMR spectroscopy. A separate portion of the thesis isabout protein-DNA binding, with a three-dimensional macromolecularstructure determined by x-ray crystallography. The search method in this thesis enumerates all conformations of amolecule (at a given level of torsion angle resolution) that satisfy aset of local geometric constraints, such as constraints derived fromNMR experiments. Systematic searches, historically used for smallmolecules, generally now use some form of divide-and-conquer forapplication to larger molecules. Our method can achieve a significantimprovement in runtime by making some major and counter-intuitivemodifications to traditional divide-and-conquer:(1) OmniMerge divides a polymer into many alternative pairs ofsubchains and searches all the pairs, instead of simply cutting inhalf and searching two subchains. Although the extra searches mayappear wasteful, the bottleneck stage of the overall search, which isto re-connect the conformations of the largest subchains, can be greatlyaccelerated by the availability of alternative pairs of sidechains. (2) Propagation of disqualified conformations acrossoverlapping subchains can disqualify infeasible conformations veryrapidly, which further offsets the cost of searching the extrasubchains of OmniMerge. (3) The search may be run in two stages, once at low-resolutionusing a side-effect of OmniMerge to determine an optimalpartitioning of the molecule into efficient subchains; then again athigh-resolution while making use of the precomputed subchains. (4) An A* function prioritizes each subchain based onestimated future search costs. Subchains with sufficiently lowpriority can be omitted from the search, which improves efficiency. A common theme of <b>these</b> <b>four</b> <b>ideas</b> is to make good choices about howto break the large search problem into lower-dimensional subproblems. In addition, the search method uses heuristic local searches withinthe overall systematic framework, to maintain the systematic guaranteewhile providing the empirical efficiency of stochastic search.

40|$|Determining the conformations of {{biological}} molecules {{is a high}} scientific priority for biochemists and for the pharmaceutical industry. This thesis describes a systematic method for conformational search, an application of the method to determining {{the structure of the}} formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-OH (fMLF) peptide by solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and a separate project to determine the structure of a protein-DNA complex by X-ray crystallography. The purpose of the systematic search method is to enumerate all conformations of a molecule (at a given level of torsion angle resolution) that satisfy a set of local geometric constraints. Constraints would typically come from NMR experiments, but applications such as docking or homology modelling could also give rise to similar constraints. The molecule to be searched is partitioned into small subchains so that the set of possible conformations for the whole molecule may be constructed by merging the feasible conformations for the parts. However, instead of using a binary tree for straightforward divide-and-conquer, four innovations are introduced: (1) OMNIMERGE searches a subproblem for every possible subchain of the molecule. Searching every subchain provides the advantage that every possible merge is available; by choosing the most favorable merge for each subchain, the bottleneck subchain(s) and therefore the whole search may be completed more efficiently. (2) A cost function evaluates alternative divide-and-conquer trees, provided that a preliminary OMNIMERGE search of the molecule has been completed. Then dynamic programming determines the optimal partitioning or "merge-tree" for the molecule; this merge-tree can be used to improve the efficiency of future searches. (cont.) (3) PROPAGATION shares information by enforcing arc consistency between the solution sets of overlapping subchains. By filtering the solution set of each subchain, infeasible conformations are discarded rapidly. (4) An A* function prioritizes each subchain based on estimated future costs. Subchains with sufficiently low priority can be skipped, which improves efficiency. A common theme of <b>these</b> <b>four</b> <b>ideas</b> is to make good choices about how to break the large search problem into lower-dimensional subproblems. These novel algorithms were implemented and the effectiveness of each is demonstrated on a well-constrained peptide with 40 degrees of freedom. by Lisa Tucker-Kellogg. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The term empathy {{has long}} been of {{interest}} in nursing, since empathy is {{one way in which}} nurses move from generalized knowledge to particular knowledge of another. Empathy enables the nurse to comprehend the situation of the other in order to improve the health or situation of that other. The focus of this conceptual analysis is the ideas of empathy within the discipline of nursing. An analysis of the nursing literature on empathy from 1960 to 1988 led to the categorization of empathy into four ideas: empathy as receptivity, empathy as emotional contagion, empathy as relationship, and empathy as communication. <b>These</b> <b>four</b> <b>ideas</b> of empathy in nursing were analyzed using differentiation type analysis and conditions type analysis. The ideas were then compared to other ideas including identification, projection, sympathy, pity, helping, and caring to identify essential characteristics of each idea of empathy. Findings reveal that emotional contagion does not share essential characteristics with the other three ideas of empathy in nursing. The remaining three interpersonal ideas, though separate and distinct, are directly related through three core components: voluntary, non-primordial experiencing of the situation of the other within some form of interaction, experiencing based on cues consciously taken in through receptivity while being focused on an accessible other, and a consequent feeling-bond in the nurse for the other. Only empathy as communication requires action, since {{there is a need to}} communicate something of the experiencing to the other for verification. In each idea, having empathy is a non-observable internal state. As a result, the nurse, and in limited situations, the other, can best determine when empathy has occurred. Being empathic refers to those observable skills and abilities related to having empathy. Implications include the importance of the nurse comprehending the situation of the other through experiencing the other 2 ̆ 7 s perspective for determining patient care needs. Current quantitative approaches to research on empathy in nursing should be reevaluated, since empathy is non-observable and, therefore, presently non-measureable. Further conceptual analysis is recommended on the essential characteristics, such as feeling-bond and receptivity, and on the analysis of related ideas such as authenticity and receptivity...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} People’s Republic of China’s foreign {{economic}} policy towards Japan between 1949 and 1965. In particular, the thesis explores Chinese policy-makers’ ideas about Japan {{in the wake of the}} War of Resistance against Japan (1937 - 1945), and considers how those ideas shaped China’s foreign economic policy towards Japan between 1949 and 1965. To do so, the thesis employs a four-part ideas framework that examines Chinese policy-makers’ background, foreground, cognitive and normative ideas about Japan, and shows how the interaction between <b>these</b> <b>four</b> different <b>idea</b> types shaped China’s Japan policy between 1949 and 1965. Furthermore, the thesis draws on over 200 recently declassified Chinese-language archival records from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, as well as additional Chinese, Japanese, US and British archival sources. It argues that China’s experience of Japanese imperialism, industrialisation and war during the first half of the twentieth century deeply shaped Chinese ideas about Japan after 1949, though in ways that at first seem counterintuitive. Although Japan had waged a brutal war against China, Chinese policy-makers viewed Japan as an important source of industrial goods, technology and expertise, and a symbol of a modern, industrialised nation-state. However, China’s experience of Japanese imperialism and militaristic aggression often made it difficult to justify the policy of ‘trading with the enemy’. Ultimately, the thesis argues that China sought to expand economic ties with Japan after 1949 because Chinese policy-makers believed that doing so would assist China in becoming a modern and industrialised state, one that was strong enough to withstand foreign imperialism and restore its central position in the international system. Chinese conceptions of Japan thus help to explain how Japan became China’s largest trade partner by 1965, despite the bitter legacy of the War of Resistance and the Cold War divide between the two countries after 1949.
