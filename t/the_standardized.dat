5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles {{to such an extent that}} it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in <b>the</b> <b>standardized</b> atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{standard}} {{is a set}} of guidelines which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility conform to the specifics of <b>the</b> <b>standardized</b> breed. All registered Highland cattle must conform to it. The {{breed standard}} was created in Inverness on 10 June 1885. There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, and the hair. Below is a concise list of the main points of the breed standard. A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided breed standard.|$|E

5|$|On 13 October 1930, {{representatives of}} the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, the Belgian War Graves Commission and the Imperial War Graves Commission met in Brussels to discuss the status of mixed British-German cemeteries in Belgium. In particular, they met to discuss the status of cemeteries {{established}} by Germans during the war {{where the majority of}} those buried in the cemetery were German. This meeting was brought about because the Imperial War Graves Commission had begun altering the layout of cemeteries containing a high percentage concentration of German dead and began replacing the existing headstones on the Commonwealth graves with <b>the</b> <b>standardized</b> Imperial War Graves Commission headstones, all without first consulting with the German Burial Service in Belgium. The German delegation hoped to retain the established design character of the cemeteries but were ultimately unsuccessful. Control for the cemetery was immediately passed to the Imperial War Graves Commission and further German contribution was limited to providing headstones for a number of graves that were lacking markers. Now that the Imperial War Graves Commission was in full control of the cemetery they immediately set about redesigning it, assigning the task to Assistant Architect William Harrison Cowlishaw. In 1933 Fritz Schult, Chief of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin to request that the Imperial War Graves Commission be approached to take control over other split British-German cemeteries such as those at Marcinelle New Communal Cemetery and Hautrage Military Cemetery. The Imperial War Graves Commission was maintaining the German graves at St. Symphorien at no cost to Germany and Schult believed it favorable to transfer management of other cemeteries if the Imperial War Graves Commission would assume all maintenance costs for those cemeteries as well.|$|E

30|$|As {{suggested}} in (Wang et al. 2005), {{the calculation of}} IMED can be simplified by decomposing G to A^T A. <b>The</b> <b>standardizing</b> transform (ST) is the special case when A^T = A, written as A = G^ 1 / 2. By incorporating <b>the</b> <b>standardizing</b> transform matrix G^ 1 / 2, IMED can be easily embedded into almost any recognition algorithm. That is, feeding the ST-transformed image G^ 1 / 2 x to a recognition algorithm automatically embeds IMED. Besides, Wang et al.showed that ST {{seems to have a}} smoothing effect (Wang et al. 2005) by illustrating a few eigen-vectors associated with the largest eigen-value of G^ 1 / 2, and then argued that since IMED is equivalent to a transform domain smoothing, it can tolerate small deformation and noises and hence improve recognition performances.|$|R
