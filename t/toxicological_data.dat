In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis.

Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) {{reviewed}} {{the safety of}} DEHP in medical devices. The SCENIHR report states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes {{there is still a}} reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticizers available for which there is sufficient <b>toxicological</b> <b>data</b> to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticizers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices. Risk assessment results have shown positive results regarding the safe use of High Molecular Weight Phthalates. They have all been registered for REACH and do not require any classification for health and environmental effects, nor are they on the Candidate List for Authorisation. High phthalates are not CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction), neither are they considered endocrine disruptors.|$|E

Recent reports have also indicated that certain nanoparticles (NPs) may also exhibit a hormetic dose-response. We describe the application of three previously described methods to quantify the magnitude of the hormetic biphasic dose-responses in nanotoxicology studies. This methodology is useful in screening assays that attempt to parse the observed <b>toxicological</b> dose-response <b>data</b> into categories based on the magnitude of hormesis in the evaluation of NPs.

However the subject is still a matter of debate. We investigated the genotoxicity of the food-borne contaminant 5 -HMF using the Ames test, the micronucleus (MN) and the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays in the human metabolically active HepG 2 cell line. Cytotoxic effect of 5 -HMF was first assessed using Alamar Blue (TM) as a sensitive sub-lethal assay. 5 -HMF did not induce any genic mutation in bacteria whatever the concentration in the Ames test. Furthermore, it does not induce clastogenic or aneugenic effects in the HepG 2 cells. In contrast, 5 -HMF induced HepG 2 DNA damage at concentrations from 7. 87 to 25 mM in the comet assay suggesting a weak genotoxic effect of 5 -HMF in the HepG 2 cells probably repaired.
