25|$|Visual memory {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. Visual memory {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards {{the end of his}} speech, Smith declared: The calamity <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> have just passed has left traces of sorrow everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds the lowly to the humble home bereft of son or mother or father, little groups of kinsfolk will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those who went down with the ship. These are choice pictures in the treasure house of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning motive for better things.|$|E

At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence.

2500|$|Kant {{argued that}} the {{structures}} of logic which organize, interpret and abstract observations were built into the human mind and were true and valid a priori.

Although the psychological or epistemological specifics given by Mill <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> build our logical apparatus may not be completely warranted, his explanation still nonetheless manages to demonstrate {{that there is no}} way around Kant's a priori logic. To recant Mill's original idea in an empiricist twist: [...] "Indeed, the very principles of logical deduction are true because we observe that using them leads to true conclusions", which is itself an a priori presupposition.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{somewhat}} {{distant from}} the territory in question, Fort Edmonton, an important stop on the York Factory Express overland trade route, was peripherally involved in the Oregon Boundary Dispute. A pair of British Army lieutenants, Mervin Vavasour and Henry James Warre, were sent on a mission {{in the guise of}} eccentric gentlemen to reconnoitre the lower Columbia River valley and Puget Sound. [...] Among other objectives, they were to determine which HBC posts could be used in a military conflict. The trip had been encouraged by Sir George Simpson [...] Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Warre and Vavasour reported that the mountain passes were unsuitable for troop transport. Their mission took them through Fort Edmonton in the fall of 1845, and again on their way back to Montreal in 1846. They wrote: [...] "Without attempting to describe the numerous Defiles <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> passed, or the difficulty of forcing a passage through the burnt Forests, and over the high land, we may venture to assert, that Sir George Simpson's idea of transporting troops[...] [...] with their stores, etc. through such an extent of uncultivated Country and over such impracticable Mountains would appear to Us quite unfeasible."

2500|$|The Sibiu Circle's {{advocacy}} of Lovinescu's program attested {{the rejection of}} far right ideals. While acknowledging that the political context of the Second Vienna Award had made [...] "national sentiment" [...] more precious to Transylvanians than ever before, the text cautioned against a revival of nationalist exclusiveness in the literary field, and rested the fault for păşunism with the early 20th century Sămănătorul review. Negoiţescu had designed {{a portion of the}} letter as a lampoon targeting [...] "neo-Sămănătorists", whom he portrayed as demagogues camouflaged in modernist trappings: [...] "Burning with the fever of exultation when they yell out the word 'culture' at each and any street corner, all the headmasters of patriotism, or morals and of poetry, in love with the 'holy soil' only because they view it from the comfortable armchairs of the city they still curse, the păşunists imagine themselves day and night at the plow horns". In a 1969 letter protesting against marginalization by communists, the author himself argued: [...] "In what concerns the politically unfavorable atmosphere that has been created around my name, it seems curious to me that those who support it will not bear in mind that, in 1943, I was the author of the Sibiu Literary Circle's Manifesto, <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> protested against fascist ideology." [...] He also insisted that his anti-fascist credentials were being recognized by several works of literary history published in the late 1960s. Commenting on the nature of his 1943 letter, Bogdan Creţu nevertheless rated it as an updated version of Lovinescu's lifelong principles, rather than a manifesto of artistic difference. Also according to Creţu, the young critic's affiliations meant that he was not [...] "obtusely disregarding" [...] traditionalist literature in its entirety, noting that Negoiţescu was lenient when it came to poems by traditionalists such as George Coşbuc, Octavian Goga and Aron Cotruş.|$|E
2500|$|Marking 200 {{years after}} this novel was published, Paula Byrne, {{author of a}} {{biography}} of Jane Austen, wrote a perspective on it, a novel she loves, while aware that Mansfield Park is not generally viewed as she sees it. The subtitle to Byrne's article was [...] "Ignore its uptight reputation – Mansfield Park, published 200 years ago this month, seethes with sex and explores England’s murkiest corners". The title of the novel and the family estate may well reflect Lord Mansfield, whose decision as Lord Chief Justice in a court case led {{to the end of}} slavery in Britain itself, and the name of Aunt Norris may be drawn from Robert Norris, the opposite of the judge, as Norris was [...] "an infamous slave trader and a byword for pro-slavery sympathies." [...] Sir Thomas Bertram's home, Mansfield Park, was [...] "a newly built property, a house erected on the proceeds of the British slave trade." [...] It is not an old structure like the one belonging to Rushworth, or the estate homes described in other of Austen's novels, like Pemberley in Pride and Prejudice or Domwell Abbey in Emma. Byrne finds this novel bold in its humour, containing [...] "Austen’s filthiest joke, when she makes a pun about sodomy in the Navy: “My home at my uncle’s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals. Of Rears and Vices, I saw enough. Now, do not be suspecting me of a pun, I entreat.”" [...] She posits that the heroine Fanny Price is [...] "the filter <b>through</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> view the mesmerising Crawfords", the Londoners who bring their lively, seductive ways to the countryside. She finds this novel to be [...] "pioneering because it is a novel about meritocracy." [...] The novel is an exploration of the role of parents in raising their children and forming their moral characters, as shown by Sir Thomas in his changing view of his niece: he first feels that she is not on the same level as his daughters, but at the end, he acknowledges her advantages in starting from hardship in her parents' home, recognizing his failings in guiding his own daughters.
