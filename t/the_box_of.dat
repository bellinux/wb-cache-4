5|$|Homer, {{disturbed}} by <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Sparkle, contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaidō, Japan for information. He is sent a promotional video for Mr. Sparkle, {{which consists of}} a TV commercial. At {{the end of the}} video, the mascot is shown to be a result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates, Matsumura Fishworks and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern. Their mascots, a smiling anime fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle. Thus, Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence.|$|E

The Fringe team is brought in on a case where several people, part of an online group attempting to decode the information sent by a numbers station, have been stricken with amnesia. They discover the station broadcasting the signal, finding its workers killed and a strange box connected to the broadcast equipment. They identify fingerprints on <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> a Joseph Feller, but his current location is unknown. Walter attempts to decipher the workings of the box, while giving hope to some of the affected people that they will get their memories back in time.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{would return}} to France six more times {{over the course of}} the next twelve years. Her {{frequent}} visits and excellent reputation made her the cause célèbre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> Petit Beurre cookies in 1916. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

25|$|Dancing en pointe {{stresses}} the feet {{in various ways}} and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> the shoes, and avoiding sickling. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.|$|E

25|$|Nathan-Turner {{attempted}} to leave once {{more at the}} end of production on the twenty-fifth season in 1988, but was once again persuaded to stay for a further year after another BBC producer – Paul Stone, who had produced <b>The</b> <b>Box</b> <b>of</b> Delights – was offered the position but declined. He and Cartmel remained on the production team for the twenty-sixth season in 1989. Although the season once again drew praise, the viewing figures were disastrous, starting at around the 3million mark and improving to only around 4.5million by the season's conclusion. At the end of the year, Cartmel was head-hunted to script-edit the BBC's popular medical drama, Casualty, and Nathan-Turner also finally left the show, although no replacements were assigned for either position as in-house production was being shut down.|$|E
25|$|The first tableau {{shows the}} {{encounter}} of Fabrice and Clélia near an auberge {{on the mountain}} road to Milan. Fabrice, still a teenager, has fled the Grianta castle in a barouche {{with his mother and}} aunt, seeking safety in Milan. The carriage is stopped by police looking for a certain Conti travelling without a passport, who then appears, with his young and beautiful daughter Clélia. The Général Conti is escorted to Milan while Fabrice offers a seat in the barouche to Clélia. The second tableau takes place in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> Gina at La Scala, where she receives Milanese liberals trying with her to find a way of getting Fabrice from arrest by Austrian police, then her lover Mosca, Conti and Clélia and finally Fabrice to whom she explains the plan to help him. By the end of the act, the feelings of Fabrice and Clélia are clear although Gina's towards Fabrice are less so.|$|E

While there, they learn that an older woman has been found fatally stabbed near the D'haran army; Nicci and Richard determine that it is Sister Tovi. Nicci uses deception to interrogate Tovi, discovering that it was Samuel who stabbed Tovi and took <b>the</b> <b>Box</b> <b>of</b> Orden she was carrying. She also learns about the Chainfire spell, about how it was used to obliterate everyone's memory about Kahlan, and that the Boxes of Orden were created in opposition to it. Later, Richard realizes that the Sword of Truth protected him from the Chainfire spell, which is why he was still able to remember Kahlan.|$|E

25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|In , the Prince and {{his father}} Sharaman attack the palace of an Indian Maharaja after the Maharaja's Vizier lets them in {{with the promise of}} treasure, among them an {{hourglass}} containing the Sands of Time. The Prince finds an artifact called the Dagger of Time, which can manipulate time. While visiting the Sultan of Azad after the battle, the Vizier betrays them and releases the Sands of Time, turning everyone but the Prince, the Vizier, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah into monsters. Despite mistrusting each other, the Prince and Farah ally. That mistrust later leads to Farah's death while saving the Prince, and the Prince uses the Sands and the Dagger to return to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, preventing those events from taking place. In Battles of Prince of Persia, the Prince goes on new campaigns for his father, but due to his interference in The Sands of Time, a mystical being called the Dahaka appears to kill the Prince and correct his changes to the timeline. The Prince's desperate attempt to imprison the Dahaka in <b>the</b> <b>Box</b> <b>of</b> A Thousand Restraints unleashes a group of hostile spirits and provokes a war between Persia and India. This leads to the death of his mother and to him becoming an outcast. He succeeds in undoing his mistake, but is forced to go on the run from the Dahaka.|$|E
