60|$|Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that {{in bright}} Greece, two {{thousand}} years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green simple boy, how <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Though not {{required}} by the Navy regulations to instruct his scholars in aught but the application of mathematics to navigation, yet besides this, and besides instructing them {{in the theory of}} gunnery, he also sought to root them in the theory of frigate and fleet tactics. To be sure, he himself did not know how <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> or furl a sail; and, owing to his partiality for strong coffee, he was apt to be nervous when we fired salutes; yet all this did not prevent him from delivering lectures on cannonading and [...] "breaking the enemy's line." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Splicing</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> with <b>a</b> laid core {{is usually}} more {{complicated}} than double braided polyester ropes. One needs more force to take the rope back into itself because there is often less room between the core and the cover.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, the splice is tapered by {{trimming}} the working strands after each tuck. Also, the splice can be whipped {{to protect and}} strengthen the <b>splice.</b> <b>A</b> <b>rope</b> thimble can be inserted in the eye to prevent chafing if the eye is to be permanently attached to a fixture (used when attaching <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> to <b>a</b> chain, for example).|$|R
60|$|Marston, {{who sat on}} the yacht's coaming, <b>splicing</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope,</b> trusted Wyndham far. Marston's {{round face}} was burned red and {{generally}} wore a look of tranquil good-humor; his mouth was large {{and his eyes were}} calm. People thought him dull and he was not clever, but Wyndham knew his comrade's stability. Although Bob was honest and trustful, he was firm. It was characteristic that the splice he slowly made was very neat.|$|R
5000|$|Rope {{splicing}} in ropework is {{the forming}} of a semi-permanent joint between two ropes or {{two parts of}} the same rope by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper {{at the end of a}} line, to form a loop or an eye in <b>a</b> <b>rope,</b> or for joining two ropes together. <b>Splices</b> are preferred <b>to</b> knotted <b>rope,</b> since while <b>a</b> knot typically reduces the strength by 20-40%, <b>a</b> <b>splice</b> is capable of attaining <b>a</b> <b>rope's</b> full strength. However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the rope. Most types of splices are used on 3-strand rope, but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided rope, as well as most double braids.While <b>a</b> <b>spliced</b> 3-strand <b>rope's</b> strands are interwoven <b>to</b> create the <b>splice,</b> <b>a</b> braided <b>rope's</b> <b>splice</b> is constructed by simply pulling the rope into its jacket.|$|R
5000|$|Modern fids are {{typically}} made of aluminum, steel, or plastic. In addition to holding rope open {{to assist the}} creation of <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> <b>splice,</b> modern push fids have markings for precise measurements {{in a variety of}} sizes of rope. The length of these fids is typically 21 or 22 times the diameter of <b>rope</b> <b>to</b> be <b>spliced.</b> <b>A</b> half-inch diameter <b>rope</b> would have any accompanying fid 10.5-11" [...] in length with hash-marks denoting the long and short fid measurements.

50|$|Installation of OPGW {{requires}} some additional planning {{because it is}} impractical <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> <b>an</b> OPGW cable in mid-span; the lengths of cable purchased must be coordinated with the spans between towers to prevent waste.

60|$|Thus the sun {{set upon}} the adventurers, in this celebrated voyage, when they had sailed with a strong breeze, to use the words of Columbus' own record, some eleven hours, after quitting the bar. By this time, they had made good less than fifty miles, in a due south course from the place of their departure. The land in the {{neighborhood}} of Palos had entirely sunk behind the watery margin of the ocean, in that direction, and the coast trending eastward, it was only here and there that the misty summits of a few of the mountains of Seville could just be discovered by the experienced eyes of the older mariners, as the glowing ball of the sun sunk into the watery bed of the western horizon, and disappeared from view. At this precise moment, Columbus and Luis were again on the poop, watching, with melancholy interest, the last shadows cast by Spanish land, while two seamen were at work near them, <b>splicing</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope</b> that had been chafed asunder. The latter were seated on the deck, and as, out of respect to the admiral, they had taken their places a little on one side, their presence was not at first noted.|$|R

40|$|In higher eukaryotes, {{alternative}} splicing is usually regulated by protein factors, which bind to the pre-mRNA and affect {{the recognition of}} splicing signals. There is recent evidence that the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA may also {{play an important role}} in this process, either by facilitating or by hindering the interaction with factors and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that regulate splicing. Moreover, the secondary structure could play a fundamental role in the splicing of yeast species, which lack many of the regulatory splicing factors present in metazoans. This review describes the steps in the analysis of the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA and its possible relation <b>to</b> <b>splicing.</b> <b>As</b> a working example, we use the case of yeast and the problem of the recognition of the 3 -prime splice site.

60|$|I {{thought him}} the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, {{especially}} as Peleg, {{his friend and}} old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began {{to think it was}} high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer <b>a</b> ship, <b>splice</b> <b>a</b> <b>rope,</b> and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.|$|R

40|$|A {{combination}} of point mutations disrupting both stem 1 and stem 2 of U 5 snRNA (U 5 AI) {{was found to}} confer a thermosensitive phenotype in vivo. In a strain expressing U 5 AI, pre-mRNA splicing was blocked before the first step through an inability of the mutant U 5 snRNA to efficiently associate with the U 4 /U 6 di-snRNP. Formation of early splicing complexes was not affected in extracts prepared from U 5 snRNA mutant cells, while the capacity of these extracts <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> <b>a</b> pre-mRNA in vitro was greatly diminished. In addition, significant levels of a translation product derived from intron containing pre-mRNAs could be detected in vivo. The SSD 1 /SRK 1 gene {{was identified as a}} multi-copy suppressor of the U 5 AI snRNA mutant. Single copy expression of SSD 1 /SRK 1 was sufficient to suppress the thermosensitive phenotype, and high copy expression partially suppressed the splicing and U 4 /U 6.

SSD 1 /SRK 1 also suppressed thermosensitive mutations in the Prp 18 p and U 1 - 70 K proteins, while inhibiting growth of the cold sensitive U 1 - 4 U snRNA mutant at 30 degrees C.
