5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured {{to such an extent that}} they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives as a result of the crash took to <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{struggled}} in two warm-up matches against Tasmania before the Australians left for England, and despite winning both fixtures, {{it was not}} to be a happy tour on <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke down with a serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{boundary}} value problems involving thin interphases, {{it is often}} desirable to have a model of an interphase which makes possible to solve for <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjacent media without having to solve for <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> it. This is usually achieved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature by replacing the interphase by a geometrical surface with appropriately designed “imperfect interface” conditions on it. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> setting of elasticity, another option is explored: the geometry of the interphase is left intact, and conditions are devised for the displacements and tractions pertaining to the media adjacent to the interphase and evaluated at both sides of it such that they will simulate {{the presence of the}} interphase. Those conditions do not involve <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> within <b>the</b> interphase, yet they depend on its material properties and on those of the adjacent media as well, and make possible to solve for <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjacent media without having to solve for <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interphase. The formulation is given in a parallel orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system suitable for the modeling arbitrarily curved three-dimensional interphases of constant thickness. Both types of the above described interphase models are tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> setting of a coated infinite fiber embedded in a matrix which is subjected to an anti-plane shear loading and an in-plane transverse shear loading at infinity, and their predictions are compared with the exact solutions for <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-phase configuration consisting of the interphase and its adjacent media. <b>The</b> model <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> interphase geometry is left intact is observed to perform generally better than <b>the</b> one <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> interphase is replaced by an interface...|$|R

5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49).

25|$|Lower {{transconductance}}: The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its {{gain and}} {{is proportional to}} hole or electron mobility (depending on device type), at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the carrier mobility, and hence the transconductance. As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage, raising <b>the</b> electric <b>field</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the transconductance.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third.

While Contador and José Rujano were easily the strongest riders on the day, the Ag2r tandem broke away from the peloton behind and secured third and fourth positions on the day. Gadret was third, which afforded him a time bonus in addition to the actual time taken. This moved him into the top ten {{for the first time in}} the race, in eighth. Dupont also entered the top ten after this stage, at tenth place. With sixth place the next day on Monte Zoncolan and attrition to other riders, Gadret moved up further, to fifth place.

5|$|Tallon responded {{during the}} 193839 season by equalling two world records. The season started poorly for Queensland, not winning {{any of their}} first three matches. Tallon made eight {{dismissals}} in the opening match of the Sheffield Shield campaign against New South Wales, but the visitors hung on for a draw with one wicket in hand. After two consecutive losses, Tallon set {{the first of his}} world records. Against New South Wales in Sydney, he dismissed 12 batsmen, six in each innings, a feat performed only once before, in 1868 by Surrey's Ted Pooley. Tallon's dozen included three stumpings and he was at the crease when Queensland hit the winning runs to complete their first victory in two years. After nine innings during the season without passing 36, Tallon returned to form with the bat, scoring 115 against South Australia, but was unable to take <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings due to injury as the match ended in a ten-wicket defeat. In the final match of the season, Tallon became the fourth keeper to make seven dismissals in an innings, in a match against Victoria. He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348, and scored 44 as Queensland completed an innings win. Tallon finished the season with 34 dismissals in six matches, setting a new Australian season record. He took more than five dismissals in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wicket. Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever; his catching and stumping style became more animated, and his appealing reached new levels of sound. He passed 100 first-class dismissals during the season, achieved in just 32 matchesthe fastest Australian to reach the mark. Tallon ended the season with 305 runs at 30.50.|$|E

The event had always been won by the United States since its {{inception}} at Olympic level in 1960, and their boycott had opened up <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia was regarded as a medal chance, but was not seen as the main threatsSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were seen as the most likely winners. The hosts's team included the silver medallists in the 100m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would later place fourth. The British had Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100m. Australia's team paled in comparison on paper. Neil Brooks, the freestyler, later came 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Peter Evans was the only individual medallist in the corresponding individual event. Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.|$|E
