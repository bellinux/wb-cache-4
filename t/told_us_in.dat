500|$|AOL's Benji Eisen called [...] "On the Floor" [...] a [...] "comeback of sorts" [...] for Lopez, {{particularly}} noting its clever cross-promotion with Idol and Lopez's multiple product endorsement deals. He applauded Lopez {{for moving}} on from her previous lack of commercial success in recent years. Kim Dawson, an {{editor for the}} UK daily newspaper Daily Star, also praised the video for returning Lopez to her [...] "day job" [...] (as a performer) despite being everyone's [...] "new favourite Idol judge." [...] The sex appeal in the video for [...] "On the Floor" [...] was likened to that last displayed by Lopez in the video for 2002's [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright". A reviewer from the Daily Express said [...] "Jennifer Lopez once <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> song that 'I'm Gonna Be Alright' and now she's proved it... The curves she displayed when she recorded the hit video nine years ago {{have been replaced by}} a leaner, fitter look [...]" [...] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone agreed with comparisons to Lopez's earlier work: [...] "Basically, this is classic Lopez tweaked for 2011... visuals that update late-Nineties bling with a high fashion wardrobe nearly as eccentric as that of Rihanna and Lady Gaga." [...] As a result of the video's premiere, the online traffic at Lopez's official Vevo account increased by 1000%. In the space of two weeks, the video was viewed over thirty million times on Lopez's official Vevo page, according to USA Today.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Thornton Page later {{stated that}} the panel members met informally prior to the main panel meetings, with ‘no outsiders’. At this meeting [...] "H.P. Robertson <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the first private (no outsiders) session that our job was to reduce public concern, and show that UFO reports could be {{explained}} by conventional reasoning." [...] This would suggest that the remit of the panel and its subsequent conclusions should be seen as {{part of the process of}} implementing the recommendations of CIA’s own review of the UFO situation.|$|E
2500|$|Capitalizing on {{the success}} of the 1950s big-money quiz The $64,000 Question on CBS, Barry and Enright {{developed}} their flagship show, Twenty One, a quiz which had a scoring system based loosely on Blackjack. Contestants were placed in twin isolation booths and asked questions ranging in value from one to 11 points — the higher the point value, the more difficult the question. Enright described the initial broadcast of Twenty One as [...] "a dismal failure. It was just plain dull." [...] Contestants repeatedly missed questions and, in Enright's own words, [...] "It lacked all drama; it lacked all suspense. The next morning the sponsor (Geritol) called my partner, Jack Barry, and me and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> no uncertain terms that he never wanted to see a repeat of what happened the previous night. And from that moment on, we decided to rig Twenty One." [...] Even with rigging, initial ratings were unimpressive.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrics on {{the album}} deal with various subjects. [...] "Raised on Rock" [...] is a song about Scorpions' {{philosophy}} of life. Meine explained [...] "We all started listening the music and growing up with the music back in the 60s". Schenker also added [...] ""Raised on Rock" [...] is our soundtrack {{and it will be}} our soundtrack until the end of our days. It's the reason why we formed the band." [...] Songs [...] "Let's Rock", [...] "Rock Zone" [...] and [...] "Spirit of Rock" [...] deal with the same subject. [...] "Sting in the Tail" [...] is a song about attitude and as Schenker said [...] "it is really a great symbol of what the Scorpions are all about". [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] is an anti-war song about soldiers in Afghanistan and all the people around the world who stand for freedom and peace. Meine explained [...] "We all live in trouble times. I think that song is trying to express that kind of feeling". Lyrics for the song were inspired by the conversation between Meine and his friend who was preparing to go to Afghanistan for eight months. Meine said: [...] "In between the lines I could hear, 'Well, let’s hope I come back home alive'." [...] "Lorelei" [...] is a song about the legend of the water-spirit Lorelei who lives {{on the top of the}} rock Loreley above the river Rhine. [...] "SLY" [...] is the fictional song about a girl named Sly. Meine explained [...] "When [...] "Still Loving You" [...] was a smash hit back in the '80s, many folks made love to that song, obviously. Many people <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> Europe, especially France, 'We called our daughter Sly because of Still Loving You'" ...|$|E

60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> that <b>in</b> {{this great}} wood there were immense numbers of elephants; and upon the desert, great multitudes of lions, lynxes, tigers, leopards, &c.; {{and that it}} was to that wood and that desert that the negroes went to get elephants' teeth, where they never failed to find a great number.|$|R
60|$|It was on Saturday {{night that}} {{she met the}} sad end to which I have before alluded.

6000|$|... 'It {{touches her}} deeply!' exclaimed the Duchess. 'Ah! {{to see her}} in the {{mountains}} teaching the wild men to say their Aye, and to wear culottes, the little prince interpreting for her, as King James <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> his story of the saint his ancestor.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, {{it struck}} me that he might be the man who had sent the letters. He had, as Hawtrey <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the evening, a bitter grudge against him, and such a dirty trick as this was just {{the sort of thing that}} a disreputable broken-down knave like him might concoct to gratify his malice.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's in the Bible. And Mr. Isaac Crothers at Maywater <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> too, <b>in</b> Sunday School. He was {{an elder}} and a pillar {{in the church}} and knew all about it. But you needn't worry. If you're good you'll go to heaven and if you're bad I guess you'd rather go to hell." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{found it}} {{where he had}} <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> wrapped <b>in</b> a sealed paper, and with it a codicil of recent date, in which he named Mr. Miles and Mr. Pickwick his executors, - as having no need of any greater benefit from his estate than a generous token (which he bequeathed to them) of his {{friendship}} and remembrance.|$|R

6000|$|Barker laughed more heartily. [...] "No. Not their business.

And here's the plant for a railroad. Don't you see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} be careful what you say of him before Agatha," [...] said Jane. [...] "Oh, you need not be alarmed, Agatha; I know all about it.

We went out this morning--Gertrude and I--and {{when we came back}} we found Mr. Trefusis and Agatha talking very lovingly to one another on the {{conservatory}} steps, newly engaged." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{passed up}} the chief street of the bazaar. The {{inhabitants}} <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> pantomime {{the chief of}} the town was away at Asioot, whither he had gone two days ago on business. If he were here, our interpreter gave us to understand, things might have been different; for the chief had determined that, whatever came, no infidel dog should settle in his oasis.|$|E
60|$|As {{an example}} of how utterly {{oblivious}} a pair of towers can be to their work, George <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> later on <b>in</b> the evening, when we were discussing the subject after supper, of a very curious instance.|$|R

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact he spoke about forty {{disconnected}} words. But his accent was so good for these forty. He did not speak English, he imitated an English voice making sounds. And the effect was startling. He had served on the Italian front with the Scots Guards--so he <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> Italian. He was Milanese. Oh, he had had a time with the Scots Guards. Wheesky--eh? Wheesky.|$|E
60|$|This {{was indeed}} at first a monstrous voyage in its appearance, and the want of {{provisions}} threatened us. William <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> so many words, {{that it was}} impossible we could carry provisions enough to subsist us for such a voyage, and especially fresh water; and that, as there would be no land for us to touch at where we could get any supply, it was a madness to undertake it.|$|E

They <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> {{town that}} some of the {{soldiers}} and the folk of that sort were gone out to rabble cur church and our parson, and father is Churchwarden, you know.

60|$|As we {{went home}} we heard singing, {{and went into}} the porch of the schoolhouse to listen. A {{fisherman}} entered and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> to go <b>in.</b> It was a psalmody class. One of the girls had a glorious voice. We stayed for half an hour.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} the Story Girl's dry, piteous eyes, and {{suddenly}} remembered that I {{had never seen her}} cry. When she <b>told</b> <b>us</b> sad tales, <b>in</b> a voice laden with all the tears that had ever been shed, she had never shed one of her own.|$|R

[...] "And now, if you will kindly tell us where Mr. Norman Young does live, we won't intrude on you any longer. Come, girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrade Gregory has <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> {{only too}} apologetic a tone, {{that we are}} not the enemies of society. But I say that we are the enemies of society, and so much the worse for society. We are the enemies of society, for society is the enemy of humanity, its oldest and its most pitiless enemy (hear, hear). Comrade Gregory has told us (apologetically again) {{that we are not}} murderers. There I agree. We are not murderers, we are executioners (cheers)." ...|$|E
