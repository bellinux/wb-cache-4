5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of estrogen present. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E

5|$|A new ergate {{spends the}} first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> part of a process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens {{for the development of}} axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|Satellite {{observations}} {{record a}} decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellites when satellite observations began. In some areas, including China, snow cover has increased. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed from 1978 to 2006. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas {{there may be an}} increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} by Charles Payne, an engraver {{who founded the}} firm of Payne & Taylor for calico printers in 1849. In 1849, Payne becan to purchase parcels of land that he would later construct the house on. The main block {{of the house was}} erected in 1855–1856 and later expanded with a north wing in the mid-1870s. The final major addition was an ell {{on the west side of}} the house, the date of construction occurred prior to 1902. Though the house has been the subject of some alterations, <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> largely inconspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanics}} of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn. Most of <b>these</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> geared toward reducing the randomness and guesswork {{involved in these}} processes. For Disciples of the Hand, all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the Crafting Log. Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For Disciples of the Land, players are allowed to select which item {{they would like to}} attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> {{examples}} of phase polymorphism; {{they were first}} analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre. He made his discoveries during his studies of the desert locust, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species. He designated the two phases as solitaria and gregaria. These are {{also referred to as}} statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory. Charles Valentine Riley and Norman Criddle were also involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. <b>These</b> <b>changes</b> <b>are</b> primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
