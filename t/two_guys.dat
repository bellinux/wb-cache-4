Babe is disgusted by his actions. She is later rescued by Kendall and Greenlee; they knock Richie out and tie him up. A little while afterwards, Richie is freed by Annie while Kendall and Greenlee are distracted, but Annie later kills him out of frustration. His death sparks a murder mystery.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{change into}} a girl, she {{is shown in}} the anime as {{completely}} clueless about basic matters related to being a girl such as feminine modesty, how she walks, talks, and handles herself throughout the day. In the manga, this is shown to a much lesser extent and Hazumu is able to adjust to living like a girl much quicker and with less direct interference from others than in the anime. In the anime, Tomari tries to teach Hazumu everything there is about being a girl, but in the manga she is very reluctant to the fact that Hazumu's sex has changed and tries to help her as little as possible in becoming more feminine. Hazumu's personality in the manga is more direct than her anime counterpart, such as when expressing outward annoyance towards her parents' eccentric behaviors, and Hitoshi's awkwardly straightforward interferences in her love life. Also, during the day at the beach in the manga version, Hazumu seeks out Asuta when she is being hit on by <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> and asserts that Asuta is her boyfriend, but in the anime Asuta takes the role of Hazumu's protector and asserts that she is his girlfriend.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson later {{remarked that}} [...] "Johari Window" [...] was a [...] "stand-alone" [...] episode in an interview: [...] "There is nothing from that thing that {{broadens}} the story, {{except at the}} heart of it, is a story about love and acceptance and family... Which of course, for these <b>two</b> <b>guys,</b> is the entire theme of the show for them. So I think we've done that really well". Actor John Noble added, [...] "Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'. I thought it was one of my favourite stories".|$|E
500|$|During filming, Roth held {{a grudge}} against Heston {{due to his}} work with the National Rifle Association: [...] "It was very {{difficult}} for me. On one level, there's the man and he's my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing is what it is now. I'm so against it, very vocally so. But it was inappropriate for the workplace. If I'm going to talk to him, I'll talk to him outside the workplace. So it was just <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> in makeup doing a scene." [...] Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston.|$|E

500|$|The 2009 {{video game}} [...] adapted a post-The Killing Joke timeline, in that Barbara Gordon feeds Batman {{information}} as Oracle. Several {{references to the}} story are also made in the game. The Joker's makeshift throne made of mannequins {{at the end of}} the game is almost identical to the one in the graphic novel. During the game, it is revealed that the Joker had been using e-mail under the alias [...] "Jack White," [...] which Batman identifies as [...] "one of Joker's oldest aliases." [...] The Joker even personally makes a knowing reference to the story: [...] "There were these <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> in a lunatic asylum... Oh hell, you've heard that one before, haven't you?" ...|$|E
500|$|Konietzko {{said the}} ideas for songs began with {{individual}} sounds, which he then modified until {{he created a}} looped rhythm. [...] "Craze", for example, Konietzko called [...] "an homage to Atari Teenage Riot, a band with <b>two</b> <b>guys,</b> one girl, a couple TR90S drum machines and a bass machine." [...] He said he was inspired by touring with the band in Europe in support of Nihil in 1995. After creating the base tunes, the songs went to Günter Schulz, another longtime member, to add guitars. With the completed songs, Konietzko then allowed guest artists, such as Connelly, to pick songs they wanted to contribute to, and added their vocals or other instrumentation. [...] For Xtort, Konietzko used Macintosh products {{to do all the}} synchronization.|$|E
500|$|The music used in {{the segment}} of the episode where Squidward's marching band is playing while coming down the street was from Nick Carr, the series' music editor. He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's take this one step further. What if they couldn't even play their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments. Hutchins made the two men play most of the instruments terribly. He said, [...] "I got these <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> to squeak, blast, and squawk {{on most of the}} instruments they sold." ...|$|E
50|$|The Freinberg Transmitter is a {{broadcasting}} transmitter on the Freinberg near Linz. It {{was established}} in 1928 as medium wave broadcasting station and used until 1936 a T-antenna, which hung up on <b>two</b> <b>guyed</b> masts, which were 45 metres tall.|$|R

50|$|The Gartow-Höhbeck {{transmitter}} had, until 2009, <b>two</b> <b>guyed</b> antenna masts, {{one with}} a height of 327 metres, the other with a height of 344 metres. This made Gartow-Höhbeck transmitter the only transmission site in Europe with two supertall towers, that were exclusively used for transmissions in the VHF/UHF range.|$|R
500|$|Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe {{praised the}} {{chemistry}} between the series' main characters {{and the performance}} of Jansen as Aida, but said [...] "most of this is just preamble to the sight of <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> with a lot of attitude and similar pyrokinetic powers unleashing holy hell on one another in a building chock full of explosives. I am [...] than okay with this." [...] The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy graded the episode a 'B', praising the episode for focusing the season's overarching storyline and for the emotional reunions between Johnson and the core S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He was positive of the ongoing Ghost Rider storyline and the episode's action sequences, but thought Aida's story was [...] "the much more intriguing long-term story ... it offers the unusual opportunity for Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. to dig into some juicy subtext and weighty concepts".|$|E
500|$|It {{had long}} been a dream in the Scrubs writer's room to do a musical episode. Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence is a self-confessed musical theatre [...] "nerd," [...] as are many of the writers. In addition, many of the cast members have had {{backgrounds}} in musical theatre. According to Lawrence, [...] "I knew that Donald [...] and Judy [...] were Broadway-style singers and dancers. I knew Sarah [...] could dance, because she danced when she was young. I knew Zach [...] loved musical theater. I had actually seen Ken Jenkins in Big River on Broadway when I was a kid. Neil Flynn and John C. McGinley were the last <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> to admit that they'd {{done a lot of}} musicals and stuff, but being actors, they had. Johnny C. knew how to do a Gilbert and Sullivan number, and Neil had a big baritone voice." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and context sensitive dialog, {{with a total of}} twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in ways that were not possible in {{the first game of the}} series. Zampella said, [...] "We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience. So now you'll hear your guys telling you that there's [...] <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> hiding behind that rusty car in the street or that there are people on the second floor of a building".|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2008, Raonic had {{received}} scholarship offers from several colleges, including the University of Michigan, Princeton, and Northwestern University, and committed {{to play for the}} University of Virginia that fall while studying finance. Just two weeks before school started, he consulted his parents about his plan to turn professional instead. Raonic and his parents agreed that he would take correspondence courses in finance from Athabasca University while starting a professional tennis career, setting a deadline of two years for reaching the top100. During that summer, his world ranking ranged between No. 915 and No. 937. Raonic reached the top100 in January 2011, around five months later than the target deadline. He thus turned down the scholarships and turned professional, agreeing to be represented by the sports agency SFX. University of Virginia men's tennis coach Brian Boland later commented that [...] "I have only seen <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> turn down scholarships and then succeed quickly on the Tour: Sam Querrey and Milos Raonic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California on October 15, 1997. The set {{was closed to}} the usual taping {{audience}} when Carey, Bader, Ferguson, Gomez and Stiles performed their striptease to The Edgar Winter Group's [...] "Free Ride". The Full Monty cast members came to the set to offer advice and watch the taping. The remainder of the episode was filmed before an audience later that same night. Gomez quipped that having <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> paint his body in make-up was [...] "more embarrassing" [...] than filming the routine, while Stiles joked that the episode {{was the first time}} he had been [...] "totally naked" [...] since he was cast in the show. Carey admitted that he was grateful that stripping during prime-time had to be PG and apologized that viewers had to see his naked buttocks. He also clarified that the cast wore pouches to protect their modesty.|$|E
500|$|The {{two were}} tempted to ally {{themselves}} with Steven Spielberg, who produced Used Cars and I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which were both box office bombs. Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg, who had [...] "loved" [...] it. Spielberg, however, was {{absent from the}} project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him, {{he would never be}} able to make another film. Gale said [...] "we were afraid that we would get the reputation that we were <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> who could only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg." [...] Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead, which was a box office success. Now a high-profile director, Zemeckis reapproached Spielberg with the concept. Agreeing to produce Back to the Future, Spielberg set the project up at his production company, Amblin Entertainment, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film.|$|E

500|$|The video {{primarily}} shows West and Jay-Z destroying {{and then}} customizing a Maybach 57 and then racing around an industrial lot in it (with no doors or windows), while four models smile and laugh from the backseat. The [...] "dynamic duo take a saber saw to a glistening new Maybach {{and turn it}} into a tricked-out 'Thunderdome' cruiser, then do doughnuts in a parking lot with a gaggle of models packed in the back." [...] The video [...] "eschews the narrative spazzouts and stoner-boggling tricks of previous Jonze videos" [...] preferring instead to [...] "luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals. We get fireworks, fist bumps, a fast car, and general larger-than-life camaraderie rather than, say, guys on fire running in slow-motion. It's like The Expendables, if that movie only starred <b>two</b> <b>guys,</b> and both of them were rappers who didn't do any onscreen fighting." [...] The car was put up for auction, and the proceeds donated toward the East African Drought Disaster.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep {{waiting for something}} to happen, and after a while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> in the woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those <b>two</b> <b>guys</b> – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
