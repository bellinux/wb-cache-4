40|$|I {{study the}} {{information}} content of bond rating changes using newly available transaction {{data from the}} over-the-counter (OTC) corporate bond market. While existing studies use event windows ranging from one week to one month and have produced mixed results, I examine the bond market response to rating change announcements over a standard two-day event window. In contrast to prior studies that document significant stock price reactions <b>to</b> <b>downgrades</b> but not upgrades, I find that the corporate bond market responds significantly <b>to</b> both <b>downgrades</b> and upgrades. In addition, bond prices continue to drift significantly following rating changes. <b>Downgrades</b> appear <b>to</b> be partially anticipated by the corporate bond market, as bond prices decline significantly prior <b>to</b> <b>downgrades.</b> Cross-sectionally, I show that negative excess bond returns prior <b>to</b> a <b>downgrade</b> indicate greater market anticipation, as evidenced by a weaker market response when the downgrade is announced. Furthermore, the bond price response <b>to</b> a <b>downgrade</b> is significantly stronger for lower-rated firms while the response to an upgrade is especially strong if the firm’s rating is raised from speculative grade to investment grade.

5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening, Mekkhala tracked northwestward {{and made}} landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar of the Philippines at around 15:00 Philippine Standard Time (07:00UTC), where Typhoon Hagupit also made landfall the month before. Both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Mekkhala to {{a tropical storm}} on January17, due to land interaction weakening the storm significantly. Mekkhala weakened further while crossing the Bicol Region on January 18, leading the JTWC <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> it to a tropical depression when it turned northward and emerged into the Philippine Sea. Late on the same day, the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression, and shortly after the JTWC issued the final warning as strong wind shear exposed the LLCC. The tropical depression drifted northeastward and maintained its exposed low-level circulation east of Luzon, until the system was completely absorbed by a stationary front early on January 21.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's stake {{purchase}} allowed Rare {{to expand}} significantly. The {{number of staff}} members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, Killer Instinct, on their own custom-built arcade machine. Killer Instinct was set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> the game's graphics. Killer Instinct sold 3.2 million copies, and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Killer Instinct 2. Killer Instinct Gold, the console version of Killer Instinct 2, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.|$|E

5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{opted for}} the all-new MX3000 from Siemens as a {{replacement}} for the T1000 stock instead of the T2000. Although its design was found to be unsuitable, the T2000 was initially not planned to be replaced by the MX3000, as the line was to remain with overhead wires and none of the new MX3000 trains are equipped with pantographs. However, following Oslo's decision to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to full metro standard, allowing longer than two-car trains. A proposal <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> the line to light rail standard and make it part of the Oslo Tramway was rejected.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season {{originated}} from an area of convection east of Diego Garcia in early October 2001. Moving southwestward, it slowly organized, with convection developing around a weak circulation. Late on October3, MFR classified {{the system as a}} zone of disturbed weather. On October5, the agency re-classified it as a tropical disturbance and later as Tropical Depression 1. The circulation was partially exposed due to wind shear, although it had good outflow. The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 01S at 0600UTC on October6, estimating winds of about 65km/h (40mph). Due to the shear, the convection gradually diminished, prompting the MFR <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> it to a tropical disturbance on October7. The next day, the JTWC issued its last advisory, noting that the system was dissipating.|$|E
5|$|A {{strengthening}} {{ridge to}} the south turned the storm {{to the south}}west, bringing Gillian back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When Gillian was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity to land and continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the ridge to the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On14 March, the JTWC again assessed a high potential for Gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting {{the appearance of a}} central dense overcast. At 06:00UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> Gillian to a tropical low.|$|E

5|$|Dora {{held its}} peak {{strength}} for just six hours before {{it began to}} weaken due to cooler waters {{and the presence of}} wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800UTC on July22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80mph (130km/h) decrease in winds in just 24hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity. The low persisted for a day as it tracked north-northwestward, eventually dissipating 70mi (110km) south-southwest of Bahía Asunción on July 26.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{north and}} {{northeast}} {{while under the}} influence of the aforementioned trough, Marty began to weaken soon after peak intensity as deep convection was displaced to the east due to the strong westerly shear; the low-level circulation center became fully exposed in a span of three hours late on September28. Upwelling of cooler waters further decayed the deep convection, prompting the NHC <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> Marty to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC (1a.m.CDT) on September29. Continuing to steadily weaken, Marty degenerated into a post-tropical low a day later about 140mi (225km) west-southwest of Acapulco, while still producing gale-force winds. The shallow system turned westwards in the low-level flow and eventually opened up into a trough twelve hours later about 195mi (315km) west of Acapulco. The low became closed once again on October1, however, it failed to produce sufficient organized deep convection to re-qualify as a tropical cyclone. It turned north-northeastwards towards the southern Gulf of California, however it dissipated before reaching the coast of Western Mexico. The remnant moisture continued into Northwestern Mexico and caused flooding in Sonora.|$|E
5|$|Following peak intensity, the {{combination}} of increasing wind shear and lowering sea surface temperatures began to slowly weaken Iselle, bringing it below Category4intensity early on August5. Continued wind shear caused the storm to further degrade and its eye to become ragged in appearance. The NHC downgraded Iselle below major hurricane intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 00:00UTC on August6, forecasting responsibility transferred from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC). Although wind shear began to decrease thereafter, abundant dry air caused Iselle to rapidly weaken, dropping to Category1 intensity on August6. However, the suppressed wind shear allowed for the hurricane to reorganize and maintain a large eye as it tracked towards Hawaii, and Iselle reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 100mph (155km/h) at 00:00UTC on August7, making it a minimal Category2 hurricane. Only slow degradation of Iselle's structure followed, though on August7, the storm's eye had faded and the CPHC estimated that Iselle had weakened to a minimal hurricane. Becoming increasingly disorganized, Iselle weakened to a tropical storm the next day before making landfall at 12:30UTC along the Kau coast of Hawaii island with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The mountainous terrain of the island largely disrupted the main cyclonic circulation of Iselle, which manifested {{as a collection of}} small vortices south of the Hawaiian islands. Due to the loss of any sustained thunderstorm activity at the storm's center, the CPHC decided <b>to</b> <b>downgrade</b> Iselle to a remnant area of low pressure on August9; at the time, the disturbance was centered roughly 200mi (320km) west-southwest of Honolulu.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{empirical}} evidence of abnormal returns associated with credit rating changes for {{a sample of}} 264 credit ratings announcements by 43 international and US banks between 2000 and 2012. The banks in the sample have either a primary or secondary US listing. We provide evidence using four models for estimating expected returns including the Fama-French Three-Factor model (1992). We find short-term negative abnormal returns are exhibited <b>to</b> <b>downgrades</b> and positive post-announcement abnormal returns are exhibited to both upgrades and downgrades. Cumulative abnormal returns exhibit a positive trajectory following an upgrade announcement whilst cumulative average abnormal returns <b>to</b> <b>downgrades</b> return almost <b>to</b> zero over our event window. In contrast to previous studies, we identify that concurrent announcements impact significantly on reported abnormal returns using our four models and hence we present our results after removal of contaminating effects. Whilst we are hampered by small subsamples in our test data, {{we are able to}} identify a significant difference between our subsamples for unanticipated and anticipated ratings announcements. We also provide evidence that US domestic banks experience significantly larger negative abnormal returns <b>to</b> <b>downgrades</b> than international banks listed in the US, which we attribute to the greater impact of a rating change of a US bank {{on the rest of the}} local economy. Finally, we report abnormal returns and significance for pre- and post- financial crisis samples, simultaneous and long-term only rating announcements, ratings within and across investment classes, and ratings which cross the investment grade line.
