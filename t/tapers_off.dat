5|$|Traffic volumes on Highway35 vary {{considerably}} over {{the length of}} the highway, as well as {{over the course of the}} year due to its use for recreational purposes, including snowmobiling, cottaging and camping. Along the Highway35 and Highway115 concurrency, the average daily vehicle count is above 20,000. This drops as Highway35 splits off at Enterprise Hill to under 10,000. This volume is fairly consistent as far north as Minden, at which point the vehicle count drops below 5,000 and <b>tapers</b> <b>off</b> as low as 2,000 at Highway60.|$|E

25|$|The Spade Ranch {{continues}} to operate {{today in the}} traditional western fashion. Most of the original buildings in the Home Valley of the Spade are extant and functioning in their original capacity. Although ranching operations have changed considerably {{since the early days}} of Richards and Comstock, cowboys and ranch hands are still employed by the Bixby's. The number of employees needed to operate the ranch has significantly decreased over the last few years due to advancements in technology and equipment. During the summer months of July and August hay is harvested out the large meadows to be used to feed cattle during winter. Calving season begins in February and <b>tapers</b> <b>off</b> by early April. This is a very critical time and the calving herd requires around the clock supervision. Large roundups are carried out in the spring and fall to ready cattle for market and branding. Branding at the Spade is a large yearly event – cattle are roped from horseback, wrestled by hand and branded with the Spade brand. The Branding is traditionally concluded with a large western dinner. Cattle are no longer shipped to market by train, but rather by cattle truck. Aircraft are used to locate cattle in large pastures, spot downed fences and for ranch business abroad. Bixby Black Angus cattle are nationally recognized for both their quality and genetics. The Bixby Family works closely with the Nebraska State Historical Society and Chadron State College in the preservation and research of the Sandhills region of Nebraska.|$|E
40|$|Background Benzodiazepine {{withdrawal}} programmes {{have never}} been experimentally compared with a nonintervention control condition. Aims To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of <b>tapering</b> <b>off</b> long-term benzodiazepine use in general practice, and to evaluate the value of additional group cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT). Method A 3 -month randomised, 3 -month controlled trial was conducted in which 180 people attempting to discontinue long-term benzodiazepine use were assigned to <b>tapering</b> <b>off</b> plus group CBT, <b>tapering</b> <b>off</b> alone or usual care. Results <b>Tapering</b> <b>off</b> led to a significantly higher proportion of successful discontinuations than usual care (62 %. 21 %). Adding group CBT did not increase the success rate (58 % v. 62 %). Neither successful discontinuation nor intervention type affected psychological functioning. Both tapering strategies showed good feasibilityin general practice. Conclusions <b>Tapering</b> <b>off</b> is a feasible and effective way of discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine use in general practice. The addition of group CBT is of limited value...|$|R

500|$|Flynn has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from film critics. Kirk Baird of The Blade [...] described the character as irresistible, while Columbus Alives Brad Keefe called him [...] "loveable". Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies lauded Flynn as [...] "a hero invested with enough colour to liven up {{what could have}} been a monochromatic role". Margot Harrison of Seven Days concluded that the character is [...] "better than a prince". Meanwhile, Amy Nicholson of Inland Empire Weekly reviewed the character as a significant improvement upon traditional Disney heroes, writing, [...] "If anything, Tangled is hommepowerment—one more step forward in Disney's slow march to treat male suitors like equals, from its early nameless princes ... to here, a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time." [...] Tyler Hanley of the Palo Alto Weekly observed that [...] "Flynn talks in a laid-back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable". Ian Bunting of the Daily Record concluded that although [...] "Male characters sometimes get shortchanged in Disney movies ... Flynn is one of their better efforts to add to Aladdin, Mowgli and the Beast." [...] Virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with Flynn. Anthony Quinn of The Independent described the character as a [...] "fop", while Tom Huddleston of Time Out called him [...] "bland". The Scotsman wrote, [...] "it's a shame the prominence of Rapunzel's wayward love interest ... needlessly distracts from" [...] the film.|date = January 27, 2015|accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = The Scotsman|publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd|last = |first = }} Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Flynn [...] "a second-rate Nickelodeon TV punk". Jeff Meyers of the Metro Times dismissed Flynn as not [...] "all that heroic". The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli quipped that Flynn's [...] "sensitive chin fur, and the way he talks out of the side of his mouth [...] makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam". The Los Angeles TimesKenneth Turan believes that the film's [...] "initial shakiness" [...] is [...] "amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of" [...] Flynn. Accusing the character of [...] "lacking both superficial and emotional individuality", Jake Coyle of the Southtown Star panned Flynn as [...] "rather obnoxious", Dan Kois of The Village Voice dismissed him as [...] "vanilla". Flynn's narration has also been widely panned. Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referred to it as [...] "flippant". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described it as [...] "annoyingly smart-alecky". Justin Chang of Variety described the character's opening monologue as [...] "clunky". William Goss of Moviefone compared Flynn to [...] "a modern-day Chris Evans/Pine type, and his glib narration [...] combined with a hasty prologue [...] almost makes it feel like writer Dan Fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys' AND girls' club". However, Goss relented, [...] "The voice-over <b>tapers</b> <b>off,</b> though, and Levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to the neurotic love interest." ...|$|E

The road descends into a narrow creek valley at West Eaton, and the highway proceeds east along Eaton Brook to the hamlet of Eaton on the Chenango River. The stream ends here, leaving the route to traverse another set of mountains to reach a low-lying, marshy area near Bouckville. Here, NY26 crosses NY46 ahead of a junction with US20. NY26 turns east at the junction, following US20 through Bouckville toward the village of Madison.|$|E
2500|$|During orgasm, a human male {{experiences}} rapid, rhythmic contractions of the anal sphincter, the prostate, and {{the muscles}} of the penis. The sperm are transmitted up the vas deferens from the testicles, into the prostate gland as well as through the seminal vesicles to produce what is known as semen. The prostate produces a secretion that forms one of the components of ejaculate. Except for in cases of a dry orgasm, contraction of the sphincter and prostate force stored semen to be expelled through the penis's urethral opening. The process takes from three to ten seconds, and produces a pleasurable feeling. Ejaculation may continue for a few seconds after the euphoric sensation gradually <b>tapers</b> <b>off.</b> It is believed that the exact feeling of [...] "orgasm" [...] varies from one man to another. Normally, as a man ages, the amount of semen he ejaculates diminishes, and so does the duration of orgasms. This does not normally affect the intensity of pleasure, but merely shortens the duration. After ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs, during which a man cannot achieve another orgasm. This can last anywhere from less than a minute to several hours or days, depending on age and other individual factors.|$|E
