5|$|Shortly after returning, Heather {{slips into}} a trance so John makes his excuses and quickly leaves. Upon {{coming out of}} it she pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that {{something}} terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches it, believing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. As the life drains from him, John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{created for}} 7- to 14-year-olds, {{the books are}} written in the second person. The protagonist—that is, the reader—takes on a role {{relevant}} to the adventure; for example, private investigator, mountain climber, race car driver, doctor, or spy. Stories are generally gender and race neutral, though in some cases, particularly in illustrations, presumption of a male reader (the target demographic group) do appear. In some stories, the protagonist is implied <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> whereas in other stories, they are an adult.|$|E
25|$|The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, draws {{heavily from}} Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw {{an elderly man}} walking on the sidepath outside {{the window of his}} home. The man stopped to glance at a startled Craven and walked off. This served as the {{inspiration}} for Krueger. Initially, Fred Krueger was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.|$|E

50|$|Blessing the Children {{provides}} {{relief and}} support to children through child sponsorships. Individual and corporate sponsors can support specific <b>children</b> with <b>a</b> $30/month sponsorship or for those desiring <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> only sponsor, some choose to fully sponsor <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with $90/month. Sponsorships provide all of the services and support that the child needs, including full tuition, shoes and clothes, medical care, food, shelter, and vocational training for both {{the child and the}} foster family. The need for sponsorship <b>is</b> clearest <b>to</b> those who experience the need first-hand, as teams returning frequently sponsor children.|$|R
25|$|Shakta {{practitioners}} {{are said to}} have a theophany of the Goddess, {{in the form of a}} young girl or woman or in the sky or she may possess the corpse. The Shakta practitioner is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of the Divine Mother, who is surrounded by fear, tormented by ghosts and demons and overcome with love towards her and needs to be rescued by the Mother. When the Goddess is said to possess the corpse, the corpse is considered sacred as a murti or vessel of the divine spirit. The head of the corpse is said to turn towards the devotee and begins speaking affectionately (or sometimes terrifyingly) with him. The devotee then asks for a boon (spiritual or worldly) that the Goddess is compelled to grant. Some practitioners regard that his own body becomes a corpse while performing the ritual. The Goddess fills life into him by possessing him.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous image of the Tet Offensive, a photo that was taken by Eddie Adams, was the {{photograph}} that depicted a Vietnamese man being executed by the Southern Vietnamese General, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The photo shows the moment of death for the young man. Adams won a prize for his iconic photo, which {{was said to be}} more influential than the video that was released of the same execution. The impact that the photos had on the American public was astounding. Support for the war plummeted, and though two hundred thousand troops were requested {{at the beginning of the}} Offensive, the request was denied. Adams had another photo published that, while not making as big as an impact as his other photo, was certainly gruesome. The image depicted a soldier, who appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> dead and lying on the side of the road, with a group of civilians looking down at the body. It was published on May 5, 1968.|$|E

Draper {{did not want}} her children to be actors; she explained, [...] "Nat kept putting signs on his door: 'I want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> actor!' I said, 'No, it's too brutal. However, Nat wrote and directed a sitcom called Don't Eat Off My Plate, which Draper presented in documentary style by interviewing his friends.|$|E
500|$|Born into {{a musical}} family, {{he spent his}} early {{childhood}} {{in a small town}} in Transylvania. He quickly proved himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> prodigy on the violin, and moved to Budapest with his father to study with the renowned pedagogue Jenő Hubay. After completing his studies with Hubay in his early teens, Szigeti began his international concert career. His performances at that time were primarily limited to salon-style recitals and the more overtly virtuosic repertoire; however, after making the acquaintance of pianist Ferruccio Busoni, he began to develop a much more thoughtful and intellectual approach to music that eventually earned him the nickname [...] "The Scholarly Virtuoso".|$|E

500|$|The Joker {{is portrayed}} with a {{somewhat}} homosexual element, {{described as being}} indirectly [...] "in love" [...] with Batman. In the script, Morrison initially wanted the Joker to [...] "wear make-up and black lingerie in parody of Madonna." [...] DC's editors, however, removed this, believing that readers might assume that Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character in the Batman film would be portrayed as a transvestite. Unlike traditional superhero comics, many forms of sexual references are seen, {{and many of the}} villains in the novel are heavily sexualized. The Mad Hatter is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> molester; Clayface is described as [...] "AIDS with two legs"; and Amadeus Arkham is seen cross dressing.|$|E
500|$|Born in the Iraqi Kurdistan in 1983 {{during the}} Iran–Iraq War, she {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} her family and thousands of others from a chemical attack by Saddam Hussein's government troops against the rebellious Kurds when she was five years old. She was captured by Saddam's forces and taken as an orphan by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, who brainwashed her and brought a famed Gurkha sniper to train her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> combatant for the government. Three years later, during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, she fled to a Kurdish refugee camp. There, the legendary U.S. Army Special Forces veteran known as Big Boss noticed her extroardinary abilities and brought her with him to the United States, where she received counselling and deprogramming to remove her Iraqi brainwashing, leaving only her fighting abilities with her. Extremely grateful, she thought of Big Boss as a modern Saladin and followed him in whatever he did, until his mutiny and later death at the hands of FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake (as depicted in [...] ). She was then found by Solid Snake's brother Liquid Snake, who convinced her to join a FOXHOUND splinter cell under his command.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode, {{and gave it a}} D. He called the visual effects [...] "hilariously bad," [...] likening the CGI to [...] "a '90s computer game." [...] Sava added, [...] "As mediocre as the series has been, it was on a bit of an upswing with the last few episodes, but 'True North' is a big step backwards... The problem isn’t that these kids can’t act (although that might be the problem), it’s that the writing for their characters is horrible... This week’s episode is straight-up children’s television, and not in the way that it can be enjoyed by all ages. You need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to suspend your disbelief long enough to watch 'True North.'" [...] Despite the critique, Sava did enjoy Caulfield's scenes, as well as Emma and Mary Margaret's conversation concerning motherhood. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwen Orel opined that the Hansel and Gretel [...] "parallel is clear and rather sweet, with touches of the ongoing story of Emma and Snow White, too." [...] Orel felt the episode seemed [...] "like a demented episode of Chopped," [...] and called the gingerbread house [...] "just like it should , colorful and candylike." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{measure of}} {{infidelity}} <b>is</b> covert illegitimacy, <b>a</b> situation which arises when someone who <b>is</b> presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> father (or mother) {{is in fact}} not the biological father (or mother). Frequencies as high as 30% are sometimes assumed in the media, but research by sociologist Michael Gilding traced these overestimates back to an [...] informal remark at a 1972 conference. The detection of unsuspected illegitimacy can occur {{in the context of}} medical genetic screening, in genetic family name research, and in immigration testing. Such studies show that covert illegitimacy is in fact less than 10% among the sampled African populations, less than 5% among the sampled Native American and Polynesian populations, less than 2% of the sampled Middle Eastern population, and generally 1–2% among European samples.|$|R

2500|$|Freddy {{exclusively}} attacks {{teenagers and}} his actions have been interpreted as {{symbolic of the}} often traumatic experiences of adolescence. Nancy, like the archetypal teenager, experiences social anxiety and {{her relationship with her}} parents becomes very strained. [...] Sexuality is present in Freudian images and is almost exclusively displayed in a threatening and mysterious context (e.g., Tina's death visually evokes a rape, Freddy's glove between Nancy's legs in the bath). [...] The original script actually called for Krueger <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> molester, rather than a child killer, before being murdered.|$|E

50|$|Because he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> diplomat, {{marriage}} {{still had}} to wait, and {{to stay with him}} she finally had <b>to</b> pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> governess. It <b>was</b> with that role that she first arrived in Japan in 1901. Four years later, the imperial authorization to wed arrived and, after 17 years of courtship and subterfuges, the couple finally married in London in 1905. For reasons of protocol, she took the Japanese citizenship and a Japanese name. Her husband suggested Iso (磯), meaning seaside, because she loved the beach so much and because it sounded a little like Ethel. After the wedding she followed him around the world, finally returning to Japan with him, never to leave again. She liked the country and successfully adapted to it, even giving English lessons to members of the Imperial Family, among them Prince Chichibu, brother of Emperor Hirohito.|$|R
