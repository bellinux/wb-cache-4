5|$|Following {{the lead}} of Hendrix in rock, psychedelia began to {{influence}} African American musicians, particularly <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Motown label. This psychedelic soul {{was influenced by the}} civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by Sly and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.|$|E

5|$|The first {{internationally known}} bands from Dominica were 1970s {{groups such as}} Exile One and Grammacks. These bands were <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cadence-lypso scene, {{which was the first}} style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean. By the 1980s, however, Martinican zouk and other styles were more popular. In 1988, WCK formed, playing an {{experimental}} fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as bouyon, and has re-established Dominica in the field of popular music.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E
5|$|Delta and Epsilon {{mark the}} fly's left wing and right wing, respectively. With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.62, Delta is an orange giant of spectral type K2III located around 91light-years away. Epsilon Muscae {{is a red}} giant of spectral type M5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.31 over approximately 40days. It has expanded to 130 times the Sun's diameter and 1800 to 2300 its luminosity. It was a star originally 1.5 to 2times as massive as our Sun. Although of a similar distance—around 302 light-years—to <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, it is moving much faster at around 100km/s and does not share a common origin. To the northwest lies Mu Muscae, an orange giant of spectral type K4III that varies between apparent magnitude is 4.71 and 4.76 and has been classified as a slow irregular variable. Near Mu is Lambda Muscae, the third-brightest star in the constellation and a white main sequence star of spectral type A7V around 128light-years distant from Earth.|$|E

5|$|On 27 August 1970, Barnes curtailed a brief spell {{as manager}} of Bangor City to return to Manchester City {{as a member of}} the {{coaching}} staff. When Malcolm Allison departed the club in 1973, Barnes was offered the role of caretaker manager, but, soured by his experiences at Wrexham, he turned it down. Instead he became assistant to the eventual managerial appointee Johnny Hart. Seven months later ill health forced Hart to step down. In the reorganisation that followed the appointment of Hart's replacement Ron Saunders, Barnes became chief scout, a role he retained for two decades until he was sacked by Peter Reid in 1991. In his role he oversaw the development of a large number of successful young players, including Paul Lake, David White and Steve Redmond, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manchester City youth team which won the 1986 FA Youth Cup. In 1994, he returned to the club at the invitation of Francis Lee, who had recently become chairman. Barnes served in a part-time scouting position for a further six years.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of the {{two films}} was marred by Donner's bad {{relationship}} with the Salkinds, with Richard Lester acting as mediator. With the film going over-budget, the filmmakers decided to temporarily cease production of II and move that film's climax into the first film. Despite Supermans success, Donner {{did not return to}} finish Superman II, and it was completed with Lester, who gave the film a more tongue-in-cheek tone. The Salkinds also cut Brando for financial reasons, while John Williams quit as composer due to turning his attention to other projects. Superman II was another financial and critical success, despite stiff competition with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the same year. In 2006, after receiving many requests for his own version of Superman II, Richard Donner and producer Michael Thau produced their own cut of the film and released it on November 28, 2006. The new version of the film received positive response from critics and <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original film.|$|E

The Whiskers split in two and formed the Aztecs. After Rocket Dog died in 2008 and Ella established dominance. Five Whiskers males emigrated into the Lazuli kicking out Thundercat who soon joined the Whiskers. The group recently recovered after a low in numbers. Many Whiskers formed or joined other groups.
