2500|$|In the United States and Canada, several expressways have {{a special}} lane (called an [...] "HOV Lane" [...] – High Occupancy Vehicle Lane) {{that can only be}} used by cars {{carrying}} two (some locations-three) or more people. Also, many major cities have instituted strict parking prohibitions during rush hour on major arterial streets leading to and from the central business district. During designated weekday hours, vehicles parked on these primary routes are subject to prompt ticketing and towing at owner expense. The purpose of these restrictions is to make available an additional traffic lane in order to maximize available traffic capacity. Additionally, several cities offer a public telephone service where citizens can arrange rides with others depending on where they live and work. The purpose of these policies is {{to reduce the number of}} vehicles on the roads and thus reduce rush-hour <b>traffic</b> <b>intensity.</b>|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a model to}} link national to local traffic forecasts. The model {{takes into account the}} empirical relationship between national and local transport developments, as well as mobility effects of the implementation of traffic and transport policy at the local level. Output of the model is the local intensity per road type and per vehicle type. The effects of local implementation of national traffic and transport policy on the local <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities,</b> noise nuisance and air pollution in towns are calculated in this study. The study shows that municipalities do not fully implement the national environment policy. This has led to higher local <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> and slightly higher noise nuisance and air pollution levels. The model has been developed to improve the forecast of local <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> in the so-called National Environmental Outlooks (NEO), which are periodically compiled by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM). An NEO presents the current status of environmental policy, specifically in the Netherlands. It indicates the future environmental quality that is expected to be achieved on the basis of measures announced by the government. Transport and traffic {{is one of the main}} sectors in the NEO causing local environmental problems such as noise nuisance and air pollution in towns...|$|R

In decision-making processes travelers seldom act perfectly rational.

The aims of this study were: (1) to determine travelers' ability to detect changing <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> and <b>traffic</b> light setting on their trip, and (2) to determine how travelers estimate the value of such changes.

30|$|Before {{implementing}} our own {{approach to}} transmit power control, some exploratory experiments were performed. In every experiment, {{the current level}} of SDDV was simulated (level 2). During a single simulation run, the transmit power was kept static, different simulations were executed with values gradually decreasing from 33 to 3 dBm (in steps of 5 dBm). For each transmit power value, the four different <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> were simulated. The results indicated that from the CAM PSR perspective, {{there is no need to}} dynamically adjust the transmit power: the maximum value of 33 dBm corresponded with the best performance for all four considered <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities.</b> When focusing on the DENM PSR, however, it is beneficial to lower the transmit power for the highest vehicle density (10 m inter-vehicle distance). In the other cases, no distinct profit could be observed.|$|R

The reference intensity of traffic is then calculated by taking the average <b>traffic</b> <b>intensity</b> of the top thirty days in the year. Measurements taken on individual days can be discarded.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of a fuzzy logic traffic signal controller for an isolated intersection. The controller {{is designed to be}} responsive to real-time traffic demands. The fuzzy controller uses vehicle loop detectors, placed upstream of the intersection on each approach, to measure approach flows and estimate queues. These data are used to decide, at regular time intervals, whether to extend or terminate the current signal phase. These decisions are made using a two-stage fuzzy logic procedure. In the first stage, observed approach traffic flows are used to estimate relative <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> in the competing approaches. These <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> are then used in the second stage to determine whether the current signal phase should be extended or terminated. The performance of this controller is compared to that of a traffic-actuated controller for different traffic conditions on a simulated four-approach intersection...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle-induced air {{pollution}} and traffic noise on a local scale {{are determined by the}} volume of road traffic and the spatial distribution of traffic flows. The purpose of this report is to identify the factors of influence on this spatial distribution so as to improve the modelling of local <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> at a national level. In this way, estimates of local traffic-induced environmental problems will be made more reliable in future environmental outlooks. The results of an analysis made in eight Dutch cities underline the importance of infrastructural and geographical factors, such as distinguishing between road types and the location of roads in relation to the city centre. A concentration of traffic flows on the main road types and the location of roads and a shifting of <b>traffic</b> <b>intensities</b> from the city centre to the outskirts were ascertained for 1987 - 1997.

50|$|Internet traffic {{research}} {{show that}} the <b>traffic</b> <b>intensity</b> is directly affected by the tariffs charged in connecting customers to their Internet Service Provider (ISP).

The conclusion of the research was that by varying prices over time, a telecommunications service provider can reduce the level of the <b>traffic</b> <b>intensity</b> at peak periods, resulting in lower equipment costs because of the reduced need to provision to meet peak demand, which in turn leads to increases in long-term revenue and profitability.
