5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Penny {{was named}} {{as one of}} three successors to the {{retiring}} Jay Pritizker besides his son Tom and his cousin Nick. <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> named the official head of the businesses, Nick and Penny each named vice-chairman. Together, the three were to oversee the Pritzker family assets. Jay intended to keep the family business together, devising a system of trusts that would allow individual family members to receive money from the trusts to meet their needs; however, the family's wealth was to be primarily maintained in the trusts to grow the businesses and fund philanthropic endeavors. The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion.|$|E
5|$|Males {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of 15, but do not {{typically}} reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old <b>Tom,</b> <b>was</b> reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia. This would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010.|$|E

5000|$|The Owens Valley, at {{the base}} of Mt. <b>Tom,</b> <b>is</b> a little over 4,000 feet, and the summit of Mt. <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> 13,658, for almost 10,000 feet of relief. The common routes up Mount <b>Tom</b> <b>are</b> not {{technically}} difficult, most are class 2-3, but they are all strenuous and long. [...] Summiting Mount <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> possible in a single day, but should only be attempted by those in very good physical condition.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> a happy, good natured 12-year-old who {{is curious}} and investigative in nature. Tom has enough faith in himself {{to stand up}} for what he {{believes}} in, but can come across as shy. In Perim, <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> never shy; he feels respected for what he does and says. <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> starting to gain confidence in the real world because of his victorious adventures in Perim. Mad Cap and Intress <b>are</b> <b>Tom's</b> best friends. <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> a friend of the OverWorlders and an enemy of Kazdan, who supports and helps the UnderWorlders in their quest for the ChaosRock.|$|R
5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> the most fun, yet the hardest work {{compared with other}} characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{said that}} he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and {{hardware}} store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> not there {{and that he had}} tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberger's shop.|$|E
50|$|While this {{is still}} a germ of an idea, <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> {{approached}} by Mr. Gale and Mr. Ware, representatives of the Universal Flying Machine Company, a competing airship manufacturer. <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> offered a lucrative salary to join the firm, but <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> uninterested in the money. Tom's refusal infuriates the men, and events are set in motion, which include the (accidental) kidnapping of Mr. Nestor, Mary's father.|$|R
50|$|Mount <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> a {{mountain}} located in Grafton County, New Hampshire, about 1.5 mi {{southwest of the}} height of land of Crawford Notch. The mountain is named after Thomas Crawford, whose family ran three inns in Crawford Notch {{in the first half}} of the nineteenth century. Mount <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> part of the Willey Range of the White Mountains. <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> flanked to the south by Mount Field. Mt. <b>Tom</b> <b>is</b> drained on the east by Crawford Brook and on the west by the Zealand River.

5|$|Wyatt {{said in his}} {{deposition}} afterward that he {{had been}} temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-—a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> still armed.|$|E

25|$|Morgan again {{encountered}} resistance at Lebanon where, {{despite the}} Confederate victory, his nineteen-year-old brother <b>Tom</b> <b>was</b> killed. From Lebanon, Morgan's men made haste through Springfield toward Bardstown, where {{they learned that}} Union soldiers were {{less than a day}} behind, and that Louisville was already bracing for another attack. Morgan had the advantage of surprise, however, having selected Brandenburg as his target instead. He sent an advance detachment to make preparations for crossing the Ohio, and on July 7, they captured two steamboats, the John B. McCombs and the Alice Dean. By midnight, all of Morgan's men were on Indiana soil.|$|E
25|$|Fleming went to Loudoun Moor School and Darvel School, {{and earned}} a two-year {{scholarship}} to Kilmarnock Academy before moving to London, where he attended the Royal Polytechnic Institution.
