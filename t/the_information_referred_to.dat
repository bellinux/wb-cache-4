Aims: To determine the number and type of Mexican and Latin American articles on IBS published between 1990 - 2015. Methods: A systematic search of Medline was carried out employing the terms «Irritable Bowel Syndrome» or its abbreviation (IBS). Mexico and every other Latin American country were added to specify the search. The articles were selected if they were published in Mexico and/or the rest of Latin America, if they were international papers on IBS in the region, or if they were written by Mexican and/or Latin American authors. In addition, the articles were classified into the following categories: Review Articles/Editorials/Letters to the Editor (REV/ED), studies emphasizing aspects of Epidemiology/Quality of Life/Psychosocial Factors (EPI/QOL), articles dealing with Diagnoses (DX), with Treatment (TX), and Translational/Pathophysiologic studies (TRANS). Results: A total of 66 articles from Mexico and 47 from Latin America were identified, but only 87. 7 and 48. 9 %, respectively, fit the selection criteria. Category distribution was: EPI/QOL: 36. 2 %, REV/ED: 27. 5 %, TRANS: 18. 8, TX: 10 %, and DX: 7. 5 % and was similar between Mexico and Latin America (p =  0. 33).

Second, two-stage model of communication. Other information that local communities should also have to know they can not get directly, for example, information about their surrounding villages. Then the village head as opinion leader who became the place to get information.

O objetivo deste estudo foi criar uma escala para medir a qualidade de vida de profissionais de educação física por meio da Teoria da Resposta ao Item (TRI). Trata-se de um estudo quantitativo, {{transversal}} e exploratório. A população do estudo foi composta por todos os profissionais de Educação Física (PEF), inscritos no conselho regional de educação física (CREF-SC), de acordo com a listagem fornecida (13. 908). A amostra foi definida pelos profissionais que retornaram o questionário respondido, totalizando n= 940 profissionais. Sendo usada para calibrar os itens e construir a escala da qualidade de vida dos Profissionais de Educação Física. Cada PEF recebeu um e-mail com uma carta de apresentação do estudo e o link para acessar ao questionário - Whoqol-Breve - via Google docs, sendo coletadas as informações referidas a qualidade de vida (QV). O tratamento dos dados foi feito por meio da TRI através do modelo de resposta gradual (MRG) de Samejima. Para isso, foi utilizado um software específico para estimação dos parâmetros e do traço latente chamado MULTILOG. Os resultados possibilitaram a criação de uma escala com 26 itens de quatro categorias ordinais em dez níveis da escala. A maior parte dos PEF, ou seja, cerca de 70 % se concentraram na região central da escala, nos níveis ? 50 ? e ? 60 ?, que fazem referência a uma ?boa QV?. Os itens mais fáceis para os PEF contemplarem em sua QV foram: o ?I 3 ?, associado a dor física; o ?I 4 ? relacionado com a necessidade de tratamento médico e o ?I 15 ?, relacionado com a capacidade de locomoção. Por outro lado, os itens mais difíceis dos PEF terem em sua QV foram o ?I 9 ?, associado às questões do ambiente físico; o ?I 12 ? relacionado com a questão da moradia e o ?I 24 ? relacionado ao acesso aos serviços de saúde. Portanto, foi possível ordenar e fazer inferências qualitativas dos PEF. Isso mostra a vantagem em utilizar a TRI na obtenção da medida da QV, uma vez que coloca tanto os itens como os PEF numa mesma escala. Abstract : The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a scale to measure the quality of life of physical education professionals through the Item Response Theory (IRT). This is a cross-sectional, exploratory study. The study population was composed of all the professionals of Physical Education (PEF), enrolled in physical education regional council (SC - CREF), according to the list provided (13, 908). The sample was defined by professionals who returned the questionnaire and total n = 940 professionals. Being used to calibrate the items and build the scale of quality of life Physical Education Professionals. Each PEF received an e - mail with a letter of presentation of the study and the link to access the questionnaire - WHOQOL - Brief - via Google docs, and collected <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the quality of life (QOL). The data analysis was done by TRI through the gradual response (MRG) of Samejima model. For this, a specific software for parameter estimation and latent trait called Multilog was used. The results enabled the creation of a 26 -item scale with four levels of ordinal scale into ten categories. Most PEF, ie approximately 70 % concentrated in the central region of the scale levels " 50 " and " 60 ", which refer to a " good QOL. " The easiest items to contemplate PEF in their QOL were: " I 3 ", associated with physical pain, the " I 4 " associated with the need for medical treatment and " I 15 ", related to the ability of locomotion. On the other hand, the most difficult items of PEF have in your QV were the " I 9 " issues associated with the physical environment, the " I 12 " related to the issue of housing and " I 24 " related to access to health services. Therefore, it was possible to sort and make qualitative inferences of PEF. This shows the advantage of using the TRI in obtaining the measure of QOL, it puts both the items as PEF same scale...|$|E
