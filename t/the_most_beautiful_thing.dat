500|$|The poem {{is one of}} five {{surviving}} {{poems by}} Sappho which is about [...] "the power of love". [...] It expresses the speaker's desire for the absent Anactoria, praising her beauty. This encomium follows the poet making the broader point that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> to any person is whatever they love the most; an argument that Sappho supports with the mythological example of Helen's love for Paris. [...] Some commentators have argued that the poem deliberately adopts this position as a rejection of typical Greek male values. [...] The poem follows a chiastic structure, beginning with a preamble, moving through to the mythical exemplum of the story of Paris and Helen, and returning to the subject of the preamble for the concluding stanza.|$|E

After {{arriving}} at the Bosphorus, they board a galley where, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cunégonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: [...] "I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Sappho 16 is a {{fragment}} of a poem by the archaic Greek lyric poet Sappho. [...] It is from Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry, and is known from a second-century papyrus discovered at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. [...] Sappho 16 is a love poem – the genre for which Sappho was best known – which praises the beauty of the narrator's beloved, Anactoria, and expresses the speaker's desire for her now that she is absent. [...] It makes the case that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world is whatever one desires, using Helen of Troy's elopement with Paris as a mythological exemplum to support this argument. [...] The poem is at least 20 lines long, though it is uncertain whether the poem ends at line 20 or continues for another stanza.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly ranked Blue Velvet's soundtrack [...] on {{its list}} of the 100 Greatest Film Soundtracks, at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, [...] "the {{haunting}} soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film." [...] Lynch worked with music composer Angelo Badalamenti {{for the first time}} in this film and asked him to write a score that had to be [...] "like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> but make it dark and a little bit scary." [...] Badalamenti's success with Blue Velvet would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch's future full-length films until Inland Empire and the cult television program Twin Peaks. Also included in the sound team was long time Lynch collaborator Alan Splet, a sound editor and designer who had won an Academy Award for his work on The Black Stallion (1979), and been nominated for Never Cry Wolf (1983).|$|E
500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and {{the frenzy}} of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. [...] Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country [...] "that hasn't been shot to pieces." [...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing {{going to happen to}} you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians.

500|$|The artwork for Follow the Leader {{was done}} by Todd McFarlane Entertainment, with McFarlane and fellow Image Comics artists Greg Capullo (penciller) and Brian Hagelin (colorist) doing the album cover, and {{designer}} Brent Ashe handling the graphics work. According to drummer David Silveria, the band got interested in McFarlane after hearing that [...] "Todd had actually referred to us as 'the Doors of the 90's'", leading to them recording a song for Spawn, a film based on a comic book by McFarlane, and eventually approaching the artist to make an album cover for them. The cover art depicts a child hopscotching off a cliff and a gathering of kids waiting to follow, a concept that begun with bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu and sketched by a friend of Jonathan Davis before being submitted to McFarlane. It marked the third straight Korn cover featuring children in a disturbing context, which Davis explained by saying that [...] "Children are always scared when they're all happy and stuff. They're <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, {{but when you see}} it in our artwork, the way we've placed it, it's just kinda fuckin' weird."

500|$|Although Kiedis' {{drug use}} {{disrupted}} the early recording process, the Chili Peppers still had an enjoyable time recording the album. [...] The band was musically {{inspired by the}} rejoining of their original drummer Jack Irons, which added [...] "such an important and different element to our chemistry." [...] Beinhorn encouraged the band to expand their musical horizons on the album, and although the band were initially uncomfortable stepping out of their comfort zone, the members began to feel that Beinhorn was helping them produce their best work. [...] Slovak helped Kiedis record his vocals on the album. [...] In between takes, Slovak would run around the studio out of excitement and say [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> we've ever done." [...] Slovak reflected on his deep connection to the album in his diary; [...] "It was so fun. [...] I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] During a jam session, the guitarist created a melodic riff which differed greatly in style from the band's previous work. [...] While Slovak nearly abandoned the riff {{out of fear that}} it {{was too much of a}} departure stylistically, Beinhorn saw potential in the new melody-based style and encouraged Slovak to turn the short tune into a full song. [...] While the band was skeptical at first, each member began writing their own musical parts and the song became one of the album's three singles, [...] "Behind the Sun".|$|E
500|$|The film {{presents}} Ricky as its [...] "visionary, {{spiritual and}} mystical center". He sees {{beauty in the}} minutiae of everyday life, videoing {{as much as he}} can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{production}} of South Pacific in the mid-1950s, Connery dated a [...] "dark-haired beauty with a ballerina's figure", Carol Sopel, but was warned off by her Jewish family.

2500|$|The {{ideas that}} Goltz had first {{introduced}} in Léon Gambetta und seine Armeen were further expanded in The Nation in Arms, where he argued: [...] "The day of Cabinet wars is over. It {{is no longer}} the weakness of a single man, at the head of affairs, of a dominant party that is decisive, but only the exhaustion of the belligerent nations." [...] As such, to win war in the future required that [...] "the great civilized nations of the present bring their military organization to ever greater perfection." [...] To that end, Goltz that society needed to be militarized in peacetime on an unprecedented level, and what was required was [...] "the full amalgamation of military and civilian life." [...] Goltz was a militarist, Social Darwinist and ultra-nationalist who believed war to be something necessary, desirable and inevitable. In Goltz's Social Darwinist perspective, just as [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] prevailed in nature, the same principle applied to international relations with [...] "strong" [...] nations rightfully devouring [...] "weak" [...] nations.

2500|$|In the Phaedrus, Socrates {{makes the}} rather bold claim {{that some of}} life's {{greatest}} blessings flow from madness; and he clarifies this later by noting that he is referring specifically to madness inspired by the gods. It {{should be noted that}} Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue that shows Socrates outside the city of Athens, out in the country. It was believed that spirits and nymphs inhabited the country, and Socrates specifically points this out after the long palinode with his comment about listening to the cicadas. After originally remarking that [...] "landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me, only people do", Socrates goes on to make constant remarks concerning the presence and action of the gods in general, nature gods such as Pan and the nymphs, and the Muses, in addition to the unusually explicit characterization of his own daemon. The importance of divine inspiration is demonstrated in its connection with and the importance of religion, poetry and art, and above all else, love. Eros, much like in the Symposium, is contrasted from mere desire of the pleasurable and given a higher, heavenly function. Unlike in the Ion, a dialogue dealing with madness and divine inspiration in poetry and literary criticism, madness here must go firmly hand in hand with reason, learning, and self-control in both love and art. This rather bold claim has puzzled readers and scholars of Plato's work for centuries because it clearly shows that Socrates saw genuine value in the irrational elements of human life, despite many other dialogues that show him arguing that one should pursue beauty and that wisdom is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> of all.|$|E
