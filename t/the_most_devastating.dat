5|$|During the First World War, {{a number}} of barracks and {{voluntary}} hospitals were set up around the city, and in 1917 a German bomber crash-landed near Broad Oak Road. During the Second World War, 10,445bombs dropped during 135 separate raids destroyed 731 homes and 296 other buildings in the city, including the missionary college and Simon Langton Girls' Grammar Schools, and 115people were killed. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> raid was on 1 June 1942 during the Baedeker Blitz.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which {{has been known to}} eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls. Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries Dorchester {{suffered}} several serious fires: in 1613, {{caused by}} a tallow chandler's cauldron getting too hot and setting alight; in 1622, started by a maltster; in 1725, begun in a brewhouse; and in 1775, {{caused by a}} soap boiler. The 1613 fire was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating,</b> resulting {{in the destruction of}} 300 houses and two churches (All Saints and Holy Trinity). Only a few of the town's early buildings have survived to the present day, including Judge Jeffreys' lodgings and a Tudor almshouse. Among the replacement Georgian buildings are many, such as the Shire Hall, which are built in Portland stone. The Town Hall was erected in 1791 and had a marketplace underneath.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was {{regarded}} as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. Forming out of an {{area of low pressure}} on 27March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. Between 1 and 2April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category5 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing its identity the following day.|$|E

Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings reached the Super Bowl again until the 2016 NFL season, when the Falcons lost in {{overtime}} to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Although the game long stood as the proudest {{moment in the history}} of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 NFC Championship Game has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as it is seen by some sportswriters as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> losses in NFL history.|$|E

5|$|World War I was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> in British {{military}} history, {{with nearly}} 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed {{and was replaced}} first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be decisive in future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} success at Unsan, {{the rest of}} the Chinese forces {{advanced}} across the US lines, intending to push the US forces back across the Ch'ongch'on River and into Pyongyang. But food and ammunition shortages soon forced the Chinese to disengage on 5 November, thus ending the Chinese First Phase Campaign. Besides the victory at Unsan, the Chinese First Phase Campaign also destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division and one regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division at the Battle of Onjong. In return, the Chinese had suffered 10,700 casualties {{by the end of the}} Chinese First Phase Campaign. The Battle of Unsan has been considered to be one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> US losses of the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|In 518, Scupi was {{destroyed}} by a violent earthquake, possibly <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> one Macedonia has ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by the Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled in forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. Scupi was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. Scupi was thus transferred on another site: the promontory on which stands the fortress. However, Scupi was sacked by Slavs {{at the end of}} the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 695. The Slavic tribe which settled in Scupi were probably the Berziti who had invaded the entire Vardar valley. The city is not mentioned during the three following centuries but along with the rest of Upper Vardar it became part of the expanding First Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.|$|E

5|$|The first system, an operationally unnoticed {{subtropical}} storm, developed {{north of}} The Bahamas on June1 and dissipated {{by the following}} day without impact. Tropical Storm Ana developed offshore South Carolina on June30 and dissipated on July4, after causing minor affects in North Carolina. Hurricane Bill was a short-lived storm between that lasted from July11 to July13 and produced light rainfall in Newfoundland. As Bill as dissipating, Tropical Storm Claudette developed and caused rough seas in North Carolina. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> storm was Hurricane Danny, which caused extensive flooding, particularly in southern Alabama. Danny resulted in 9fatalities and about $100million (1997USD) in damage. The outerbands of Hurricane Erika brought rough seas and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles, causing two deaths and $10million in losses. The precursor to Tropical Storm Grace caused minor flooding in Puerto Rico. Tropical Depression Five and Tropical Storms Fabian did not impact land. Collectively, the storms of the 1997Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 12fatalities and approximately $111.46million in damage.|$|E
5|$|The sack of Amorium {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> {{events in}} {{the long history of}} Arab raids into Anatolia. Theophilos {{reportedly}} fell ill soon after the city's fall, and although he recovered, his health remained in poor state until his death, three years later. Later Byzantine historians attribute his death before the age of thirty to his sorrow over the impact of the city's loss, although this is most likely a legend. The fall of Amorium inspired several legends and stories among the Byzantines, and can be traced in surviving literary works such as the Song of Armouris or the ballad Kastro tis Orias ("Castle of the Fair Maiden"). Arabs on the other hand celebrated the capture of Amorium, which became the subject of Abu Tammam's famous Ode on the Conquest of Amorium. In addition, caliphal propaganda made use of the campaign to legitimize al-Mu'tasim's rule and justify his subsequent murder of his nephew and the rightful heir to al-Ma'mun, al-Abbas.|$|E
5|$|There {{were four}} {{particularly}} destructive hurricanes during the season, including Luis, Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne. Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn both caused catastrophic {{damage in the}} Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands. The former storm was the first hurricane to affect those regions since Hurricane Hugo, while the latter was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> cyclone on those islands since Hugo in 1989. Opal, the strongest and most intense storm of the season, caused devastation along portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Roxanne, a rare late-season major hurricane, caused significant damage when it made landfall in Quintana Roo. Additionally, Erin produced moderate damage in Florida. Felix generated strong waves, causing heavy beach erosion in the Northeastern United States and drowning nine people. Iris caused flooding that left five deaths in the Lesser Antilles. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season caused about $12.85billion (1995USD) in damage and at least 182deaths.|$|E

5|$|After {{garrison}} duty at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, {{the regiment}} {{served with the}} Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. The Coast Division was deployed in January 1862 for operations {{on the coast of}} North Carolina, and participated in the Battle of Roanoke Island and the Battle of New Bern among other engagements. Burnside's division was recalled to Virginia in July 1862. The 21st Massachusetts was then attached to the Army of the Potomac and participated in several of the largest battles of the Civil War, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>devastating</b> engagement of the war for the 21st was the Battle of Chantilly, fought on September 1, 1862, during which the unit suffered 35 percent casualties. From March 1863 to January 1864, the 21st served with Burnside in the Department of the Ohio, seeing action in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee. In May 1864, the regiment rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg.
