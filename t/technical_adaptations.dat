40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to lead to more frequent extreme precipitation events, floods and changes in frost/thawing cycles. The frequency of road closures and other incidents such as flooding, landslides and roads being washed away will probably increase. Stronger demands will {{be placed on the}} function of road drainage systems. The overall aim of this thesis was to produce scientifically well-founded suggestions on adaptation of road drainage systems to climate change involving more frequent floods. The work began by examining current practice for road drainage systems in Sweden and gathering experience from professionals working with various problems concerning surface and subsurface drainage systems. Various hydrological models were then used to calculate the runoff from a catchment adjacent to a road and estimate changes in peak discharge and total runoff resulting from simulated land use measures. According to these survey and hydrological modelling studies, adaptation of road drainage systems to climate change can be grouped into two categories: i) institutional adaptation; and ii) <b>technical</b> <b>adaptation.</b> The main approaches in institutional adaptation are to: i) raise the awareness of expected climate change and its impact on drainage systems in transport administration and relevant stakeholders; ii) include adaptation measures in the existing funding programme of the transport administration; and iii) develop an evaluation tool and action plans concerning existing road drainage systems. <b>Technical</b> <b>adaptation</b> will involve ensuring that road constructions are adapted to more frequent extreme precipitation events and responsive to changes in activities and land use in areas adjacent to roads. Changes in climate variables will have effects on watershed hydrological responses and consequently influence the amount of runoff reaching roads. There is a great need for tools such as hydrological models to assess impacts on discharge dynamics, including peak flows. Improved communication between road managers and local actors in the forestry and agriculture sectors can be a means to reduce the impacts of, e. g., clear-cutting or badly managed farmland ditches.

40|$|The {{research}} project TOETS was initiated {{as a response}} to a number of specific management questions concerning the discard problems in the Belgian beam trawl fishery, which is characterized by particularly high discard percentages of commercially unimportant organisms (invertebrates, fish species with low or no commercial interest, and individuals of commercially important species below minimum landing size). Several issues concerning the development of a suitable protocol for collecting discard data on board of commercial beam trawl vessels, the quantification of the amount and the composition of discards produced by the Belgian beam trawlers, and the evaluation of <b>technical</b> <b>adaptations</b> to the existing trawling gear resulting in a substantial reduction in the amount of discards, were the main research topics of this project. Informing the fisheries sector about the results of the project also belonged to the objectives. Based on the results of the project TOETS there is concluded that about one fourth of the Belgian catches currently consists of organisms that are discarded (with an extensive variation in discard weights, composition and length-frequency distributions). Including noncommercial organisms in the existing discard monitoring programmes implicates an enormous added value for the insights we build up with respect to the impact of beam trawling on the marine ecosystem, but requires some adaptations to the protocol, and implies as well a significantly higher physical demand of the on-board observers. However, <b>technical</b> <b>adaptations</b> to the trawling gear offer great potentials for reducing discards. (with the best results, in this study, when using a benthos release panel). However, the reduction mainly affected discarded numbers rather than weights. Finally, it is concluded that the fisheries industry is very well aware of the discard problems in the Belgian beam trawl fisheries, as is illustrated by some own initiatives and the willingness to cooperate with scientists from the Institute of Agricultural and Fisheries Research. Additionally, the resultats of the project TOETS can help our fishermen to react pro-actively to the possible future introduction of European measures to achieve discard reductions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe need {{to adapt}} to {{decrease}} farm vulnerability to adverse contextual events has been extensively discussed on a theoretical basis. We developed an integrated and operational method to assess farm vulnerability to multiple and interacting contextual changes and explain how this vulnerability can best be reduced according to farm configurations and farmers' <b>technical</b> <b>adaptations</b> over time. Our method considers farm vulnerability {{as a function of}} the raw measurements of vulnerability variables (e. g., economic efficiency of production), the slope of the linear regression of these measurements over time, and the residuals of this linear regression. The last two are extracted from linear mixed models considering a random regression coefficient (an intercept common to all farms), a global trend (a slope common to all farms), a random deviation from the general mean for each farm, and a random deviation from the general trend for each farm. Among all possible combinations, the lowest farm vulnerability is obtained through a combination of high values of measurements, a stable or increasing trend and low variability for all vulnerability variables considered. Our method enables relating the measurements, trends and residuals of vulnerability variables to explanatory variables that illustrate farm exposure to climatic and economic variability, initial farm configurations and farmers' <b>technical</b> <b>adaptations</b> over time. We applied our method to 19 cattle (beef, dairy, and mixed) farms over the period 20082013. Selected vulnerability variables, i. e., farm productivity and economic efficiency, varied greatly among cattle farms and across years, with means ranging from 43. 0 to 270. 0 kg protein/ha and 29. 4 - 66. 0 % efficiency, respectively. No farm had a high level, stable or increasing trend and low residuals for both farm productivity and economic efficiency of production. Thus, the least vulnerable farms represented a compromise among measurement value, trend, and variability of both performances. No specific combination of farmers' practices emerged for reducing cattle farm vulnerability to climatic and economic variability. In the least vulnerable farms, the practices implemented (stocking rate, input use [...] .) were more consistent with the objective of developing the properties targeted (efficiency, robustness [...] .).

This factor, combined with climate variability, can alter the duration, frequency and intensity of storm drain overflows in urban areas and lead to public health risks. In peri-urban regions where these risks are especially high it has been argued that, when domestic wastewater is managed, better prospects for freshwater water savings through swaps between urban water supply and irrigated agriculture may be possible. As a consequence of re-use of domestic wastewater, expenditure on inorganic inputs by farmers may decline and source sustainability of water supply could be enhanced.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry {{may be used}} {{to isolate}} large amounts of living, {{fluorescent}}ly labeled cells. Certain fluorescent labels, like enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), allow the assessment of direct protein-protein interaction in situ, by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). However, current flow cytometric methods either require elaborate <b>technical</b> <b>adaptations</b> or, using a single laser protocol, are hampered by background signal. We optimized a single 408 -nm laser protocol to detect FRET between ECFP/EYFP-tagged proteins. METHODS: Cell lines stably expressing ECFP and/or EYFP or an EYFP-ECFP fusion protein were used to design the settings for the flow cytometer to detect FRET-positive cells using a single 408 -nm laser. Using these settings, interactions between the subunits of the transcription factor NF-Y were studied. RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of the cells expressing an EYFP-ECFP fusion protein yielded a discrete FRET-positive population. Using the same settings, in cells expressing NF-YB-CFP and NF-YC-YFP fusion proteins, FRET could also be detected. These cells were sorted and FRET was confirmed by confocal microscopy. CONCLUSION: FRET-positive cells, expressing ECFP- and EYFP-tagged proteins, can be detected using single 408 -nm laser excitation, with low background signal. This allows high-throughput analysis and isolation of viable FRET-positive and -negative cells for subsequent biological experiments...|$|E

This paper applies an agent-based framework that considers the behavioural model of farmers in three villages in a municipality in the Philippines. Agent-based modelling is a useful policy tool for simulating the effects of different adaptation options on reducing vulnerability because it allows representation of not only the dynamic changes in climate and market but also the dynamic adaptive process of different groups of communities to the impacts of these changes. Model simulations of adaptation options under various global change scenarios showed that production support would significantly reduce future vulnerability only if complemented with appropriate market support. It is thus important for policy to provide a complementary bundle of adaptation measures. Lack of money and information are the most important reasons for not applying available <b>technical</b> <b>adaptation</b> measures, which currently hinder reduction of vulnerability in selected villages in the municipality.
