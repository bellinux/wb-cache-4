He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together.</b> If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

40|$|Most {{regions of}} {{the central nervous system}} contain {{numerous}} subtypes of inhibitory interneurons that play specialized roles in circuit function. In mammalian retina, the ~ 30 subtypes of inhibitory interneurons called amacrine cells (ACs) are generally divided into two groups: wide/mediumfield GABAergic and narrow-field glycinergic, which mediate lateral and vertical interactions, respectively, within the inner plexiform layer. We used expression profiling and mouse transgenic lines to identify and characterize two closely-related narrow-field AC subtypes. Both arise postnatally and one, surprisingly, is neither glycinergic nor GABAergic (nGnG). Two transcription factors selectively expressed by these subtypes, Neurod 6 and Satb 2, regulate a postmitotic cell fate choice between them. Satb 2 induces Neurod 6, which persists in nGnG ACs and promotes their fate, but is down-regulated in the related glycinergic AC subtype. Our results support the view that cell fate decisions made in progenitors and <b>their</b> progeny <b>act</b> <b>together</b> to diversify ACs...|$|R
