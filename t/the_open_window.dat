5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

25|$|He was hit {{again in}} July 1969. Unusually, {{he was hit}} while in his truck, driving on a {{mountain}} road—the metal body of a vehicle normally protects people in cases such as this by acting as a Faraday cage. The lightning first hit nearby trees and was deflected into <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> of the truck. The strike knocked Sullivan unconscious and burned off his eyebrows and eyelashes, and set his hair on fire. The uncontrolled truck kept moving until it stopped near a cliff edge.|$|E
25|$|In his miserable room, Dionis is {{studying}} an almanac of astrology, and listening, through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> {{to a girl}} singing; charmed by the sound, he sees (or imagines) the girl as a modern-day Ophelia. In this reverie, his eyes affixed on the zodiac, Dionis understands that he can freely travel back into the glorified past. He chooses for his destination ancient Moldavia, {{under the rule of}} Prince Alexander the Good. When he awakens, he finds himself on a meadow near Iași, dressed in Orthodox monastic clothes, and grasping the almanac. He is Friar Dan, who he has only dreamed of being Dionis, and the book is a present from his teacher, Ruben.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{character}} appeared previously in Barrie's book The Little White Bird, {{the play and}} its novelisation contain the story of Peter Pan mythos that is best known. The two versions differ in some details of the story, but have much in common. In both versions Peter makes night-time calls on the Darlings' house in Bloomsbury, listening in on Mrs. Mary Darling's bedtime stories by <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window.</b> One night Peter is spotted and, while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. On returning to claim it, Peter wakes Mary's daughter, Wendy Darling. Wendy succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him, and Peter learns that she knows lots of bedtime stories. He invites her to Neverland {{to be a mother}} to his gang, the Lost Boys, children who were lost in Kensington Gardens. Wendy agrees, and her brothers John and Michael go along.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{at about}} 3 AM, when 29-year-old African American Benoris Toney {{was shot in}} the head in the parking lot of the Dougherty Lumber Co. at 12100 Euclid Avenue. Toney had been traveling on Euclid when, according to police eyewitnesses, another vehicle began to parallel him. Toney pulled into the parking lot, where police had been stationed all night long, and the other vehicle followed him. The men in the second vehicle then shot Toney twice with a shotgun through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> of Toney's automobile. The assailants' vehicle then sped away. The police gave chase and stopped it, arresting six white adults and teenagers. Another 100 Cleveland police and Guardsmen, as well as a Cleveland police helicopter, rushed to the scene. Police later released four of the suspects, but sought a third man who allegedly fled the vehicle. Toney died on the afternoon of July 23.|$|E
500|$|Longfellow's new landlady {{had earned}} a {{reputation}} for being eccentric and often wore a turban. In the 1840s, Longfellow wrote about an incident when canker-worms were devastating the elm trees on the property. Mrs. Craigie [...] "would sit by <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> and let them crawl over her white turban. She refused to have the trees protected against them & said, Why, sir, they have as good a right to live as we—they are our fellow worms". The maid at the time, a woman named Miriam, served Longfellow his meals in his room. Longfellow called her [...] "the giantess".|$|E

Overall, Part II presents the unexpected aspects of living in the United States and becoming Americans, and explores the tensions that develop with the immigrant experience.|$|E

500|$|The stream's course leads Olivero to a mill, where {{through a}} lighted window {{he sees a}} woman tied to a chair, forced by the miller to drink the blood of a freshly {{slaughtered}} lamb. Instinctively, Olivero hurls himself through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> his [...] "leap {{into the world of}} fantasy". The miller initially offers no resistance and allows Olivero to release the woman, whom he recognises by the colour of her skin to be Sally, one of the two green children who had mysteriously arrived in the village on the day he left, thirty years earlier; Olivero also recognises the miller as Kneeshaw, an ex-pupil at the village school where he had once taught. During a struggle between the two men Kneeshaw is accidentally drowned in the mill pond. The next morning Olivero and Sally continue on Olivero's quest to find the stream's destination, a pool in the moors high above the village. Paddling in its water, Sally begins to sink into the silvery sand covering its bed. Olivero rushes to her, and hand in hand they sink beneath the water of the pool.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] Through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E
2500|$|The aria [...] "Lascia ch'io pianga" [...] from Handel's opera Rinaldo {{is used as}} the film's main musical theme. The aria has {{previously}} been used in other films such as Farinelli, a 1994 biographical film about the castrato singer Farinelli, and was used again by von Trier in Nymphomaniac during a scene referencing the sequence showing Nic approaching <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window.</b> The eight-track soundtrack features both versions of [...] "Lascia ch'io pianga" [...] and selected extracts of the [...] "score" [...] created by sound designer Kristian Eidnes Andersen.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman would have her hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not looking down at the floor as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Riggan {{wakes up}} in {{hospital}} with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. His ex-wife is worried about him but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha's rave-review which called the suicide attempt [...] "super-realism" [...] and just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes {{a picture of him}} to scare the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, whom he sees sitting on the toilet. Fascinated by some birds flying outside his room, he opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge. When Sam returns, Riggan is nowhere to be seen. She frantically scans the ground below <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> before she slowly looks up into the sky, smiles, and laughs.|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun through <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> on {{my side of the}} car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
