5|$|After the war, Göring {{was convicted}} of war crimes and crimes against {{humanity}} at <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials. He {{was sentenced to death}} by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|As of 1800 all German {{states and}} cities except Lübeck (which had the Dutch troy standard) {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> standard. It was also the standard for Denmark, Norway, the Russian Empire and most cantons of Switzerland. Poland and Sweden had their own variants of the standard, which differed from each other by 0.6%.|$|E

5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After the Nazi {{seizure of}} power in 1933, Hess was {{appointed}} Deputy Führer of the NSDAP and received a post in Hitler's cabinet. He was the third {{most powerful man in}} Germany, behind only Hitler and Hermann Göring. In addition to appearing on Hitler's behalf at speaking engagements and rallies, Hess signed into law much of the legislation, including <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws of 1935, which stripped the Jews of Germany of their rights in the lead-up to the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Pechersky {{returned}} to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war, and started working as administrator in an Operetta theater. The mass murder of Jews at the Sobibor death camp {{became part of the}} charges against leading Nazis at <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Trials. The International Tribunal at Nuremberg wanted to call Pechersky as a witness, but the Soviet government wouldn't allow him to travel to Germany to testify.|$|E

5|$|Austria and {{the states}} of the Habsburg monarchy officially had a {{different}} standard since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge in the opposite direction with a reform in 1816. But in both cases apothecaries continued to use <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> standard unofficially {{for a long time after}} it became illegal.|$|E
5|$|Braun was {{a member}} of Hoffman's staff when she {{attended}} <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Rally {{for the first time in}} 1935. Hitler's half-sister, Angela Raubal (the dead Geli's mother), took exception to her presence there, and was later dismissed from her position as housekeeper at his house in Berchtesgaden. Researchers are unable to ascertain if her dislike for Braun was the only reason for her departure, but other members of Hitler's entourage saw Braun as untouchable from then on.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the regime}} {{withdrew from the}} Treaty of Versailles and {{introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities. Germany also reacquired control of the Saar in 1935, remilitarized the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement and in direct violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia with the proclamation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in March 1939.|$|E

5|$|Nazi war leader Hermann Göring used cyanide to {{kill himself}} {{the night before he}} was {{supposed}} to be hanged during <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Trials. Adolf Hitler had also taken a pill of cyanide but he bit down on the capsule and shot himself in the right temple shortly before the fall of Berlin along with his wife, Eva Braun.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{returned}} with Hitler to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 as the Red Army approached the city. After Hitler committed suicide, Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture by the Soviets. Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station. The body was buried nearby on 8 May 1945, {{but was not}} found and confirmed as Bormann's until 1972. Bormann was tried in absentia by the International Military Tribunal in <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials of 1945 and 1946. He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging.|$|E
5|$|Despite refusing {{appointment}} to the High Court of Justice in 1928, he was offered the position again in 1941 and accepted, joining the King's Bench Division. In 1945 he served as the alternate British judge at <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials, and he was made a Privy Counsellor in 1947. He joined the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in 1950 but retired in 1956 when he had served for long enough to draw a pension. From 1958 {{he served in the}} House of Lords, and his speech against a private bill in 1962 saw it defeated by 70 votes to 36, two days before he died on 10 February 1962.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide gradually turned against the Nazis, who suffered major military defeats in 1943. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were pushed back in Eastern and Southern Europe. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from {{the east and the}} other Allied powers from the west and capitulated within a year. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials.|$|E

5|$|Following the massacres, many Serbs from Glina and its {{surroundings}} fled to Serbia or were deported to Ustaše-controlled concentration camps. The NDH collapsed in May 1945, {{and the following}} year <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials judged that the persecution experienced by Serbs in the country was a crime of genocide. Local Serbs returned to Glina after the war, partly out {{of a desire to}} remain near the graves of their deceased family members, and lived peacefully alongside their Croat neighbours until the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required him to do so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported <b>the</b> <b>Nuremberg</b> Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
