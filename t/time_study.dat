25|$|John Peter Fardy {{was born}} in Chicago Illinois, on August 15, 1922. Educated in the schools of Chicago, he {{graduated}} from high school in 1940. He took a course in typing at the Fox Secretarial College the same year and entered the Illinois Institute of Technology the following year. He majored in mechanical engineering but left after the first year. He had been doing <b>time</b> <b>study</b> work previously, so he went to work at the Cornell Forge Company as a <b>time</b> <b>study</b> man and draftsman.|$|E
25|$|Bedaux {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{contributors}} in the field of work measurement or labor measurement, one strand of the scientific management movement's influence. In this, he was strongly influenced by F.W. Taylor's book Shop Management, particularly Taylor's <b>time</b> <b>study</b> practices, and Charles E. Knoeppel's writings on industrial layout and routing.|$|E
25|$|Several of {{his papers}} from around this <b>time</b> <b>study</b> the {{connections}} between quantum field theory, knots, and Donaldson theory. He introduced {{the concept of a}} topological quantum field theory, inspired by Witten's work and Segal's definition of a conformal field theory. His book describes the new knot invariants found by Vaughan Jones and Edward Witten in terms of topological quantum field theories, and his paper with L. Jeffrey explains Witten's Lagrangian giving the Donaldson invariants.|$|E

25|$|Archaeologists {{have also}} been obliged to re-examine what {{constitutes}} an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites {{to give them some}} protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same <b>time</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Taylor is also {{credited}} {{for developing}} stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study,</b> this combined with Frank and Lillian Gilbreth motion study {{gave way to}} {{time and motion study}} which is centered on the concepts of standard method and standard time. Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the flow process chart in 1921. Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are Morris Cooke (rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works), Carl Barth (speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules [...] ) and Henry Gantt (Gantt chart). Also in 1910 Hugo Diemer published the first industrial engineering book: Factory Organization and Administration.|$|E
2500|$|After the February 26 Incident of 1936, he {{fell into}} disfavor with Emperor Hirohito due to his appeal for {{leniency}} toward rebel officers involved in the attempted coup. He {{realized that he had}} lost the trust of the Emperor and decided to resign from the Army--a decision that his superiors dissuaded him from carrying out. He was eventually relegated to a post in Korea, being given command of a brigade. Akashi Yoji argued in his article [...] "General Yamashita Tomoyuki: Commander of the Twenty-Fifth Army" [...] that his time in Korea gave him the chance to reflect on his conduct during the 1936 coup and at the same <b>time</b> <b>study</b> Zen Buddhism, something which caused him to mellow down in character yet instilled a high level of discipline for himself.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-approval Phase III {{clinical}} trials, {{like the}} APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events {{for the first}} eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others {{have pointed out that}} [...] "study 090," [...] a pre-approval trial, showed a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a 7-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another [...] ), and an 8-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the <b>time</b> <b>Study</b> 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|The Watertown Arsenal in Massachusetts {{provides}} an example of the application and repeal of the Taylor system in the workplace, due to worker opposition. [...] In the early 1900s, neglect in the Watertown shops included overcrowding, dim-lighting, lack of tools and equipment, and questionable management strategies {{in the eyes of the}} workers. Frederick W. Taylor and Carl G. Barth visited Watertown in April 1909 and reported on their observations at the shops. Their conclusion was to apply the Taylor system of management to the shops to produce better results. [...] Efforts to install the Taylor system began in June 1909. [...] Over the years of <b>time</b> <b>study</b> and trying to improve the efficiency of workers, criticisms began to evolve. [...] Workers complained of having to compete with one another, feeling strained and resentful, and feeling excessively tired after work. [...] There is, however, no evidence that the times enforced were unreasonable. In June 1913, employees of the Watertown Arsenal petitioned to abolish the practice of scientific management there. A number of magazine writers inquiring into the effects of scientific management found that the [...] "conditions in shops investigated contrasted favorably with those in other plants".|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{thought that}} by {{analyzing}} work, the [...] "one best way" [...] {{to do it}} would be found. He is most remembered for developing the stopwatch <b>time</b> <b>study,</b> which combined with Frank Gilbreth's motion study methods, later became the field of time and motion study. He broke a job into its component parts and measured each to the hundredth of a minute. One of his most famous studies involved shovels. He noticed that workers used the same shovel for all materials. He determined that the most effective load was 21½ lb, and found or designed shovels that for each material would scoop up that amount. He was generally unsuccessful in getting his concepts applied, and was dismissed from Bethlehem Iron Company/Bethlehem Steel Company. Nevertheless, Taylor was able to convince workers who used shovels and whose compensation was tied to how much they produced to adopt his advice about the optimum way to shovel by breaking the movements down into their component elements and recommending better ways to perform these movements. It was largely {{through the efforts of}} his disciples (most notably H.L. Gantt) that industry came to implement his ideas. Moreover, the book he wrote after parting company with the Bethlehem company, Shop Management, sold well.|$|E

60|$|The boy {{is made to}} sit {{six hours}} a day in a close, hot room, {{breathing}} impure air, putting the brain and the nervous system upon a constant strain, while the muscular system is repressed to an unnatural quiet. During the six hours, perhaps twenty minutes are allowed for all that play of the muscles which, up to this time, has been the constant habit of his life. After this he is sent home with books, slate, and lessons to occupy an hour or two more in preparing for the next day. In the whole of this time there is no kind of effort to train the physical system by appropriate exercise. Something of the sort was attempted years ago in the infant schools, but soon given up; and now, from the <b>time</b> <b>study</b> first begins, the muscles are ignored in all primary schools. One of the first results is the loss of that animal vigor which formerly made the boy love motion for its own sake. Even in his leisure hours he no longer leaps and runs as he used to; he learns to sit still, and by and by sitting and lounging come to be the habit, and vigorous motion the exception, for most of the hours of the day. The education thus begun goes on from primary to high school, from high school to college, from college through professional studies of law, medicine, or theology, with this steady contempt for the body, with no provision for its culture, training, or development, but rather a direct and evident provision for its deterioration and decay.|$|E
