The students believed they were using spray chalk, but after completion, they learned <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> using spray paint. The students were told that even temporary markings count as graffiti, and the students offered to remove the paint and apologize to businesses affected. Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E
5|$|The Cal-Neva Lodge {{was built}} in 1926 by real estate {{developer}} Robert P. Sherman. In 1929, Canadian Army Colonel H. H. Betts went missing from his room at the Cal-Neva; his body was found over a year later some five {{miles away from the}} hotel. The lodge was first made nationally famous later that year when actress Clara Bow cancelled checks owed to the casino worth $13,000; she claimed that she had believed that the chips she was using while playing blackjack were worth 50 cents when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> valued at $100.|$|E

5|$|The Flavian period {{also saw}} the first {{formation}} of large, double-size units, both infantry and cavalry, of a nominal strength of 1,000 men (cohors/ala milliaria), though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> mostly smaller (720 for an ala milliaria and 800 for a cohors milliaria). These were the {{mirror image of the}} double-strength first cohorts of legions also introduced at this time. Such units remained a minority of the Auxilia: in the mid-2nd century, they constituted 13% of units, containing 20% of total manpower.|$|E
5|$|With the film's Laserdisc release, Variety first {{reported}} in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when {{played at the}} usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> rapping instead of singing.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 1889, the Commission {{received}} its initial funding. Food, transportation and lodging were all compensated, plus $5 per diem. The commissioners received an additional $10 per diem while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> in service. Congress appropriated an additional $20,000 for the Commission {{to continue its}} work. In 1892, Congress appropriated another $15,000 for the Commission. March 1893, Commission got $15,000 additional appropriation.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for this mechanism of dosage compensation was discovered prior to scientists’ understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, Murray Barr and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of “nucleolar satellites, which they observed {{were present in the}} mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> packages of condensed heterochromatin, but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact nature}} of the {{relationship}} between the Kōdō-ha and the Kokutai Genri-ha is complicated. The two factions are often treated as the same or as two groups forming a larger whole. Contemporary accounts and the writings of members of the two groups make clear <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> distinct groups in a mutually beneficial alliance, however. The Kōdō-ha shielded the Kokutai Genri-ha and provided it with access, while they in exchange benefited from their perceived ability to restrain the radical officers.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Winthrop became {{governor}}, his brother, Nelson Rockefeller, {{had been the}} governor of New York since 1959 and remained so throughout Winthrop's four years in office.

25|$|In {{an essay}} {{entitled}} “Living On Mars Time,” Clancey has described a two-week period in February 2004 {{that he spent}} in Pasadena “observing how geologists and engineers controlled the Mars Exploration Rovers. There were two active rovers near the equator {{on opposite sides of}} Mars, at places called Gusev Crater (the rover we called 'Spirit') and at Meridiani Planum ('Opportunity'). I was working with the Opportunity team. At the time...the Opportunity team was living their lives as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> at Meridiani” - that is, living on Mars time, not Earth time.|$|E
25|$|Tuonela was {{the land}} of dead. It was an {{underground}} home or city for all the dead people, not only the good or the bad ones.

To travel to Tuonela, the soul had to cross the dark river of Tuonela. If the shaman had a proper reason, then a boat would come to take them over. Many times a shaman's soul had to trick the guards of Tuonela into believing that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> dead.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Empire {{purchased}} 10,000 Lewis guns in 1917 {{from the}} British government, and ordered another 10,000 weapons from Savage Arms in the US.

The Lewis guns supplied by Britain were dispatched to Russia in May 1917, {{but it is not}} known for certain whether these were the Savage-made weapons being trans-shipped through the UK, or a separate batch of UK-produced units.|$|E
