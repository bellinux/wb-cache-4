The following day, a memorial service was held in the church in Mundolsheim, which was attended by SNCF President Guillaume Pepy. SNCF suspended all test trials at high speeds until <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from the investigation can be integrated into testing processes.

5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> in Block I development.|$|E

5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> {{from a series of}} experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the questions posed by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from operating in a war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position {{at the tail end of}} the battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E

5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not have to fight for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E
5|$|The French {{would use}} <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> at Muong Khoua {{and those of}} the 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> {{during the}} South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an ad-hoc basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E

5|$|The ship's air {{group was}} {{originally}} intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M 'Claude' fighters, plus four in storage, 18 Aichi D3A 'Val' dive bombers, plus two in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N 'Kate' torpedo bombers. This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, and three in storage for the A5Ms {{by the time the}} ship commissioned in 1942. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>learned</b> from the Battle of Midway in June, the ship's fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros, and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. By the end of the year, six more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As. Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.|$|E
