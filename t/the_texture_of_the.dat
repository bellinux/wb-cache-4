5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eggs.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E

50|$|In East Asia, shaved ice desserts are {{not only}} {{flavoured}} with various types of syrup.

5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E
5|$|On the Reinanzaka House, the labourers were {{skilled in}} the use of wood, and helped Raymond engrain the texture of cedar onto the concrete.

On the Karuizawa Studio, workmen polished the concrete with sand and straw to reveal <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aggregate. Whilst at Nanzan University, the south facing facades were cast with checkerboard patterns, with applied metalwork casting abstract shadows on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; <b>the</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood after carving softened {{the tone of the}} drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E

25|$|To {{accommodate}} smoother {{penetration of}} the vagina during sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, vaginal moisture increases during sexual arousal in human females and also in other female mammals. This increase in moisture is vaginal lubrication, which reduces friction. <b>The</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vaginal walls creates friction for the penis during sexual intercourse and stimulates it toward ejaculation, enabling fertilization. Along with pleasure and bonding, women's sexual behavior with others (which can include heterosexual or lesbian sexual activity) can result in sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the risk {{of which can be}} reduced by recommended safe sex practices. Other disorders may also affect the human vagina.|$|E

40|$|Friction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in metal forming processes, and <b>the</b> surface <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> die is a major factor that influences friction. In the present investigation, experiments were conducted to understand <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> surface <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harder die surface and load on coefficient <b>of</b> friction. <b>The</b> data analysis showed that <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> friction is highly dependent on <b>the</b> surface <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> die surface. Assigning different magnitude of coefficients of friction, obtained in the experiments, at different regions between the die and the workpiece, Finite element (FE) simulation of a compression test was carried out to understand <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> friction on deformation and stress/strain-rate distribution. Simulation results revealed that, owing to the difference in coefficient of friction, there is a change in metal flow pattern.
