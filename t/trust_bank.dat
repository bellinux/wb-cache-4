40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{technical}} efficiency of Japanese <b>trust</b> <b>banks</b> by using the stochastic distance function approach, which is suitable for analyzing complex <b>trust</b> <b>banks</b> but has never applied for Japanese <b>trust</b> <b>banks.</b> Although the <b>trust</b> <b>banking</b> industry {{has been one of}} the most restricted financial sectors in Japan, it has recently been deregulated, particularly in terms of entry restrictions. Most noteworthy was the approval of the entry of the foreign-owned <b>trust</b> <b>banks</b> that represented the financial liberalization at that time. The traditional theory expects that allowing new entry makes market more competitive and therefore players become more efficient to survive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether the liberalization made Japanese banks more efficient. The results indicate that the traditional domestic <b>trust</b> <b>banks</b> possess a technical efficiency superior to new entrants (i. e., foreign-owned <b>trust</b> <b>banks).</b> However, we failed to find an apparent tendency for <b>trust</b> <b>banks</b> to be more efficient now than in the pre-liberalization period. ...|$|R

Mutual loan and savings banks, credit associations, credit cooperatives, and labor credit associations collected individual deposits from general depositors.

An internal investigation carried out by the company secretary discovered that £2 million of the ECSC loan was missing from the Parrot accounts.

25|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} exposed a {{possible}} family feud over the chain's corporate leadership. Richard Boyd, one of In-N-Out's vice presidents and co-trustee of {{two-thirds of the}} company stock, accused Lynsi Martinez and allied corporate executives of trying to force out Esther Snyder and attempting to fire Boyd unreasonably. Pre-empting the suit, Martinez, Snyder and Taylor appeared in a December video message to employees, telling them not to believe everything they hear. The company then responded with a lawsuit of its own, alleging Boyd had construction work done on his personal property and charged it to the company, as well as favoring contractors with uncompetitive bids. Boyd was then suspended from his role as co-trustee and Northern <b>Trust</b> <b>Bank</b> of California took his place (as co-trustee) until a hearing set for May 10, 2006. However, in April, the judge dismissed two of In-N-Out's claims against Boyd. A trial date of October 17, 2006, was set but never occurred, and a settlement was reached out of court. Ultimately, Boyd was permanently removed from his role as an employee and co-trustee.|$|E
25|$|After he {{returned}} to Indiana, he began practicing law in his father's firm. He soon met Helene Edwards of South Whitley, a local school teacher in Muncie. The couple was married on October 30, 1919 and purchased a home in Columbia City where they lived {{the rest of their}} lives. They had two children, Robert and Patricia. Gates' father soon brought him into the family banking business where he served as a manager in the Farmer's Loan and <b>Trust</b> <b>Bank.</b> Gates first became involved in politics in 1920 when he became the attorney for Whitley County. He became the town attorney for South Whitley in 1922, a position he held until 1944. He also served as attorney for Columbia City from 1927 through 1929. The Ku Klux Klan dominated the state government during the 1920s and Gates, thanks to his father's advice, was among the few office holders in his region who did not become involved with the secret organization. The Klan was exposed in a scandal in 1927 that led to a near collapse of the state Republican Party.|$|E

40|$|Trust in {{financial}} institutions {{is of great}} importance for financial intermediation. Against this background, we study two questions: Has <b>trust</b> in <b>banks</b> declined during the global financial crisis and what factors determine the level of <b>trust</b> in <b>banks?</b> Employing survey evidence from Austrian households, we show that <b>trust</b> in <b>banks</b> is mainly affected by "subjective" variables like the individuals' assessment of the current economic and financial situation and by their future outlooks. After controlling for these variables we show that the financial crisis has caused a reduction in trust (around - 7. 5 pp) which is sizable but not dramatic. Even at its lowest point (in {{the first quarter of}} 2009) 65 % still report to have <b>trust</b> in the <b>banking</b> system, which is a higher percentage than for many other institutions. Furthermore, the drop is only slightly larger than the drop observed after a small, non-systemic crisis that occurred in 2006. Thus, the much-stressed notion of a genuine "trust crisis" is not reflected in our data. Finally, we provide evidence that the degree of individual information does not influence <b>trust,</b> that <b>banking</b> <b>trust</b> is contagious and that the extension of deposit insurance coverage in October 2008 had a positive effect on <b>trust.</b> <b>Trust,</b> <b>Banking</b> Sector, Financial Crisis...|$|R

500|$|Location {{scouting}} {{revealed a}} former Wall Street bank {{that had been}} closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar.

[...] "But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot {{in the heart of}} Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street." [...] An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: [...] "The space literally presents Case’s power, so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don’t have to push the power, because it’s all around you." [...] The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming.

40|$|<b>Trust</b> in <b>banks</b> {{appears to}} be an {{essential}} element of well-functioning of macroeconomic systems, in general, and of financial markets, in particular. We study what factors determine the level of <b>trust</b> in <b>banks</b> before and after the 2007 - 08 financial crisis and how this crisis reshaped <b>banking</b> <b>trust</b> in 29 transitional countries. We find that younger, rural, educated, <b>banked</b> and generally <b>trusting</b> people tend to have higher confidence towards banks both in pre-crisis as well as post-crisis periods. Among country-level covariates, growth rate of GDP and Rule of Law remain positively and significantly associated with <b>banking</b> <b>trust</b> in both periods, while foreign bank participation starts to be detrimental to the trust after the crisis. In addition to ‘objective’ variables, we find that ‘subjective’ factors such as respondent’s personal experience with the crisis appear to strongly influence their <b>trust</b> in <b>banks.</b> Finally, after controlling for the “objective” variables, we find that the financial crisis has caused a decline in trust which is statistically significant but not dramatic or completely exceptional drop. Our findings indicate that the financial crisis has temporary impact on peoples’ <b>trust</b> in <b>banks</b> since pulling back the rate of GDP growth tends to fully recover <b>banking</b> <b>trust</b> in transitional countries. ...|$|R
