25|$|Transgender At Work (TAW) is an {{organization}} {{with a focus on}} addressing issues in the workplace for transsexual individuals. Its goal is to allow transsexual employees to work productively without feeling as if they must hide an essential part of themselves.

40|$|Virginia Woolf’s {{fiction has}} been {{retrospectively}} investigated as developing {{a number of}} specifically queer strategies in its representation of, in particular, gender. However, her most experimental novel, Orlando (1928), is yet to receive {{the same kind of}} attention as her more celebrated novels. Not only does Orlando represent an early engagement with camp aesthetic, it also radically engages with notions of gender performativity and <b>transsexualities.</b> This paper aims to draw attention to Orlando, by paying particular attention to two ways that Woolf, in Orlando, engages with notions of gender performativity, thus ‘queering’ the text...|$|R
40|$|Since the 17 th century {{there has}} been a {{proliferation}} of discourse on sex and a host of sexual identities have been surfaced. One such sexuality that is particularly marginalised is transsexuality; central to which is the management of the transsexual self. The critical study of such practices has often been neglected in favour of ‘mainstream’ research on <b>transsexuality’s</b> deviance, aetiology and treatment. Furthermore, internet-based resources have been identified as a key site for the management of the transsexual self. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the constructions of transitioning in popular websites aimed at transsexuals and significant others, family, friends and allies of transgendered persons (SOFFAs). A search strategy was adapted to select the most popular websites for analysis. A discourse analysis – guided by Parker’s (1992) 20 ‘steps’ – was conducted on 12 webpages. The construction of transitioning was dominated by biomedicine and the ‘psy’ professions. Due to these hegemonic powers the transsexual identity was associated with distress and thus a number of technologies of self – particularly medical intervention – were ‘needed’ for the management of the transsexual self. This construction spoke to the rights and health of transsexuals but also appeared to limit their freedom and serve capitalist gain rather than the interests of trans persons. Uncovering these power dynamics may have important implications for the Standards of Care, the controversial status of gender identity disorder in the DSM and allowing for the creation of alternative power strategies which may permit more freedom in the care of the gendered self...|$|R
40|$|Twice Upon A Time: Magic, Alchemy and the Transubstantiation of the Senses In this, {{the third}} volume of Zetesis, a neatly {{packaged}} Molotov was launched into the ‘out-there’ of art, {{of science and}} {{of life in the}} disguised form of an international call for papers. We were curious if there might be a different way to re-think/re-make the links between and amongst speculation, materiality, performativity, the senses and sensualities, with bodies both real and imagined, without having to resort to the somewhat staid methodologies of “dialectical materialism” or “objected oriented ontologies” or the seemingly overrated metrics of “scientistic deduction. ” Recognising, at the same time, that we were riding the wave of a massive, revolutionary paradigm shift brought on by advances in complexity, radical materiality and the quanta, quarks and feedback loops, robotics, artificial intelligences, <b>transsexualities</b> and ecological verisimilitude our task {{could not have been more}} urgent. The Call went out. But rather than ask for a direct or literal response to this ‘re-think/re-make’, the collective chose instead to journey onto a slightly more dangerous, curious path, one not usually linked with formal research, but instead cast often as frivolous or whimsical, illusionary, religious or just plain wrong. We chose to partner with the wild side and take a stronger look-see at the forerunners to all contemporary art, philosophy and science; to wit: magic, alchemy and the transubstantiation of the senses. Under the illusive cloak of magic, the curiosity of alchemists introduced a means for experimentation into the innate properties of materials. The transformation of raw matter into precious metals, the combination of hot sulphur and wet, cold mercury to birth the philosopher’s stone; to bring the inanimate to life, to vanish miraculously and conjure the body, as well as providing a foundation for the laws of substance based on sensory interaction and its potentiality. The scientific practices of today echo this inherent desire for material vitally ‘alive’ transformations, yet Western tradition remains cautious of unreasoned sensorial data, often treating it with trepidation. While this paradigm has proven an efficient methodology, it has installed a discriminatory partition between that which can be rationalised or mathematized and that which is supposedly ‘only’ sensory. These energised and sensate transformations mark the beginning of a new challenge against tradition, returning to curiosity, experimentation and the intensity of the senses away from conventional modes of thought. The Centre for Fine Art Research (CFAR) and the Research Centre for Creative Making (S. T. U. F. F.) based at the Faculty of Arts, Design and Media (ADM) joined forces at Birmingham School of Art – BCU to welcome papers/ performances/exhibition installations that responded to magic/alchemic practices in all their forms, including but not limited to the origins of alchemy and its contemporary relevance in science, magic performance, illusion, automata, the sensory in artificial intelligence and radical thinking in relation to concepts of time. We invited artists, scientists and philosophers to explore again the threshold between these paradigms, dwelling on curiosity and the tradition of scientific questioning. This bold and viscerally complex conference, laid the groundwork for this volume 3 of Zetesis: Twice Upon a Time: Magic, Alchemy and the Transubstantiation of the senses. The exhibitions, artwork, papers and prose contained in this volume include some of the best international practice-led and theoretically emboldened research on this topic today. By foregrounding the alchemist’s vision, we now present here in Zetesis our initial findings: a profane renegotiation of the very boundaries that seemed heretofore always insistent upon separating into binaric unities the so-called texture-realities of representation vs thought, sensation vs logic, image vs text. In challenging those easy divisions, we celebrate the (re-) turn to a ‘twice upon a time’ when transubstantiation, metamorphosis and morphogenesis gives succour to this energy we so nonchalantly call art...|$|R
25|$|Any type {{of sexual}} {{activity}} outside a heterosexual marriage is forbidden. <b>Transsexuality</b> in Iran is legal if accompanied by a gender confirmation surgery, with Iran carrying out more gender realignment operations {{than any other country}} in the world after Thailand. These surgeries are typically partially funded by the state – there have been claims that some homosexual men may have been pressured to undergo them both by government and society. Transsexuals still report societal intolerance as in other societies around the world.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{transsexualism}} {{has also}} {{been included in the}} American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With the DSM-5, transsexualism was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of gender dysphoria was created in its place. This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that <b>transsexuality</b> is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual people should not be stigmatized unnecessarily. By including a diagnosis for gender dysphoria, transsexual people are still able to access medical care through the process of transition.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, discrimination, {{including}} harassment, {{based on}} real or perceived sexual orientation or HIV/AIDS (and probably <b>transsexuality</b> and possibly transgenderism) is prohibited throughout Canada {{in private and}} public sector employment, housing, services provided {{to the public and}} publicity. All aspects of employment are covered, including benefits for spouses and long-term partners. Examples of services include credit, insurance, government programs, hotels and schools open to the public. Schools open to the public are liable for anti-gay name-calling and bullying by students or staff. LGBT Canadians have been allowed to serve in the military since the Douglas case was settled in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Another {{arena in}} which GLBT issues were being played out was in National service. Compulsory uniformed (usually military) service was {{implemented}} in 1967: all 18-year-old males were required to train full-time for two or two-and-a-half years, according to their level of education. Homosexuality and <b>transsexuality</b> were listed as conditions in a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) 'Directory of Diseases' (disease code 302). Prior to enlistment, all enlistees underwent a medical examination, during which {{they were asked to}} declare their homosexuality and/or transgender status (medics conducting the examination had little awareness of the difference between the two). New recruits who came out were deployed to non-combat, non-sensitive vocations. They were generally downgraded to a Public Employment Status of 3 (PES3) and assigned only light clerical work.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Iran has between 15,000 and 20,000 transsexuals, {{according}} to official statistics, although unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 150,000. Iran carries out more gender change operations than {{any country in the}} world besides Thailand. Sex changes have been legal since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution, passed a fatwa authorising them nearly 25 years ago. Whereas homosexuality is considered a sin, <b>transsexuality</b> is categorised as an illness subject to cure. While the government seeks to keep its approval quiet, state support has increased since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005. His government has begun providing grants of £2,250 for operations and further funding for hormone therapy. It is also proposing loans of up to £2,750 to allow those undergoing surgery to start their own businesses.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{educational}} institutions, including {{privately owned}} schools {{open to the}} general public, are public services. They are subject to human rights acts and are strictly required to not discriminate against staff or students based on all the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS (and <b>transsexuality</b> and transgenderism, see Grounds of prohibited discrimination above). They are strictly liable for harassment, name-calling and bullying of students and staff by staff on these grounds. In addition, {{as a result of}} the Jubran decision, they are liable for most such behaviour by students. They may be liable for anti-gay bullying even if the victim is not gay, nor believed to be (e.g. when a bully knowingly makes a false claim that a girl is a lesbian so that she will be ostracized or bullied by others or pressured to have sex with a boy to prove otherwise).|$|E
500|$|In her film, Pierce [...] inserts the {{unconventional}} problems of <b>transsexuality</b> into a conventional narrative structure.

Like these predecessors, Brandon's heroic stature derives from her [...] unwillingness to compromise her [...] identity … Pierce [...] presents Brandon's struggles against biological determinism as the struggles of a dignified renegade.|$|E
500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{addressed the}} various performances of gender by {{the characters in}} the film; [...] Moss and Lynne Zeavin offered a psychoanalytic analysis, calling the film a [...] "case report" [...] that [...] "presents [...] transsexual inclinations as a series of euphoric conquests" [...] and [...] "focuses on a range of anxious reactions to her [...] <b>transsexuality.</b> [...] or a case not for what they might reveal about female hysteria, but for what they might reveal about misogyny". Elaborating on the themes of the film, they wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{belief in}} [...] "lesbian & gay separatism" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the related [...] "lesbian separatism"), holds that lesbians and gay men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere. While not always appearing of sufficient number or organization to be called a movement, separatists are a significant, vocal, and active element within many parts of the LGBT community. In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of nonmonosexual orientations and of <b>transsexuality.</b> This can extend to public biphobia and transphobia. In contrasts to separatists, Peter Tatchell of the LGBT human rights group OutRage! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be [...] "political madness", stating that [...] "Queers are, like transgender people, gender deviant. We don’t conform to traditional heterosexist assumptions of male and female behaviour, in that we have sexual and emotional relationships with the same sex. We should celebrate our discordance with mainstream straight norms." ...|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and <b>transsexuality</b> have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E

2500|$|Because organ {{differentiation}} and brain differentiation occur at different times, {{in rare cases}} transsexualism can result. Only 23% of childhood gender problems will result in <b>transsexuality</b> in adulthood.|$|E
2500|$|Factors {{implicated in}} the {{development}} of <b>transsexuality</b> include chromosomal abnormalities, polymorphisms of certain genes, and variations in aromatase (cytochrome P450 CYP19) and CYP17. [...] Girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia show an increase in probability of <b>transsexuality</b> later in life; however, this risk is still only 1–3% in CAH. [...] Although historically abnormal sexual differentiation has pointed to androgens as a causal factor, there are codeterminants of gender identity and sexual orientation with overriding effects of androgens on the brain, in male transsexuals or homosexuals, or making androgen effects on the brain redundant, as in female transsexuals or homosexuals. [...] These factors are currently unknown, and thus no clear cut answer for the cause of transsexualism and homosexuality exists.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{orientation}} is not defined in any human rights act, but is widely interpreted as meaning heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality. It {{does not include}} <b>transsexuality</b> or transgender people.

2500|$|In many countries, laws provide {{protection}} from workplace {{discrimination based on}} gender identity or gender expression, including masculine women and feminine men.

2500|$|The most {{well-known}} third-gender group in India {{is perhaps the}} hijra of northern India. The hijra is the only sect that practices castration, a custom introduced during Muslim rule around the tenth century A.D. Male castration is not recommended in the Vedas {{and is not a}} traditional Hindu practice. There are an estimated 50,000 hijra in northern India. After interviewing and studying the hijra for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book, Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, as follows: [...] "There is a widespread belief in India that hijras are born hermaphrodites [...] and are taken away by the hijra community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the hijras I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens." [...] Nanda also states: [...] "There is absolutely no question that at least some hijras – perhaps even the majority – are homosexual prostitutes. Sinha's (1967) study of hijras in Lucknow, in North India, acknowledges the hijra role as performers, but views the major motivation for recruitment to the hijra community as the satisfaction of the individual's homosexual urges..." [...] The hijras especially worship Bahuchara, the Hindu goddess presiding over <b>transsexuality.</b>|$|E

The Man Who Was a Woman and Other Queer Tales from Hindu Lore, Haworth Press, [...] Sometimes they also engage in heterosexual activities as different reincarnated genders. Homosexual and transgender Hindus commonly identify with and worship the various Hindu deities connected with gender diversity such as Ardhanarisvara (the androgynous form of Shiva and his consort Parvati), Aravan (a hero whom the god Krishna married after becoming a woman), Harihara (an incarnation of Shiva and Vishnu combined), Bahuchara Mata (a goddess connected with <b>transsexuality</b> and eunuchism), Gadadhara (an incarnation of Radha in male form), Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (an incarnation of Radha and Krishna combined), Chandi-Chamunda (twin warrior goddesses), Bhagavati-devi (a Hindu goddess associated with crossdressing), Gangamma (a goddess connected with crossdressing and disguises) and the goddess Yellamma. There are also specific festivals {{connected to the}} worship of these deities, {{some of which are}} famous in India for their crossdressing devotees. These festivals include the Aravan Festival of Koovagam, the Bahuchara Mata Festivals of Gujarat and the Yellamma Festivals of Karnataka, among others.

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the GIDC diagnosis into the DSM-III in 1980 was preceded by numerous US studies and treatments on feminine boys beginning {{as early as the}} 1950s and 1960s, most prominently by John Money and Richard Green at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The prevention of <b>transsexuality</b> and / or homosexuality was explicitly stated as the goal of many of these studies: [...] "My focus will be what we might consider the prevention of transsexualism." [...] Bryant notes that feminine boys were not a new phenomenon at this time; however, the public emergence of adult transsexual women (male to female) in the 1950s was new and created a number of problems for psychologists, motivating some to undertake efforts at preventing their further emergence. Meyerowitz chronicles the deep disagreements which erupted between psychologists and physicians after Christine Jorgensen's public gender transition, namely over whether transsexuals should be permitted to align their bodies with their inner identities or whether their inner identities must be brought in line with their bodies. At the time, transsexual women were beginning to publish first-person narratives which highlighted their awareness of their femininity at a young age and Bryant notes that some clinicians and researchers thus turned their attention to feminine boys, constructing sissies as a new [...] "medicalized patient and research population." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Almodóvar {{followed}} with Bad Education (2004), tale {{of child sexual}} abuse and mixed identities, starring Gael García Bernal and Fele Martínez. [...] In the drama film, two children, Ignacio and Enrique, discover love, cinema, and fear in a religious school {{at the start of the}} 1960s. Bad Education has a complex structure that not only uses film within a film, but also stories that open up into other stories, real and imagined to narrate the same story: A tale of child molestation and its aftermath of faithlessness, creativity, despair, blackmail and murder. Sexual abuse by Catholic priests, <b>transsexuality,</b> drug use, and a metafiction are also important themes and devices in the plot. Almodóvar used elements of film noir, borrowing in particular from Double Indemnity. The film's protagonist, Juan (Gael Garcia Bernal), was modeled largely on Patricia Highsmith's most famous character, Tom Ripley, as played by Alain Delon in René Clément's Purple Noon. A criminal without scruples, but with an adorable face that betrays nothing of his true nature. Almodóvar explains : [...] "He also represents a classic film noir character - the femme fatale. Which means that when other characters come into contact with him, he embodies fate, in the most tragic and noir sense of the word". Almodóvar claimed he worked on the film's screenplay for over ten years before starting the film.|$|E
2500|$|Lesbian feminism, {{which was}} most {{influential}} from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. As with Gay Liberation, {{this understanding of}} the lesbian potential in all women was {{at odds with the}} minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender {{differences between men and women}} could not be resolved developed [...] "lesbian separatism," [...] influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston's 1973 book Lesbian Nation. Organizers at the time focused on this issue. Diane Felix, also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community. These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors. Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the lesbian sex wars, clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism, prostitution and <b>transsexuality.</b> The term [...] "gay" [...] came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.|$|E
2500|$|... "Almodóvar has {{consolidated}} his own, very recognizable universe, forged by repeating {{themes and}} stylistic features", wrote Gerard A. Cassadó in Fotogramas, Spanish film magazine, {{in which the}} writer identified nine key features which recur in Almodóvar's films: homosexuality; sexual perversion; female heroines; sacrilegious Catholicism; lipsyncing; familial cameos; excessive kitsch and camp; narrative interludes; and intertextuality. June Thomas from Slate magazine also recognised that illegal drug use, letter-writing, spying, stalking, prostitution, rape, incest, <b>transsexuality,</b> vomiting, movie-making, recent inmates, car accidents and women urinating on screen are frequent motifs recurring in his work. Almodóvar has also been distinguished for his use of bold colours and inventive camera angles, as well as using [...] "cinematic references, genre touchstones, and images that serve the same function as songs in a musical, to express what cannot be said". Elaborate décor and the relevance of fashion in his films are additionally important aspects informing the design of Almodóvar's mise-en-scène. Music is also a key feature; from pop songs to boleros to original compositions by Alberto Iglesias. While some criticise Almodóvar for obsessively returning to the same themes and stylistic features, others have applauded him for having [...] "the creativity to remake them afresh every time he comes back to them". Internationally, Almodóvar has been hailed as an auteur by film critics, who have coined the term [...] "Almodóvariano" [...] (which would translate as Almodóvarian) to define his unique style.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{performance}} in Edinburgh, Madonna was urged {{to remove the}} use of (fake) firearms from the show due to the 2012 Aurora shooting. Although threatened, Scottish police did not interrupt the show. The singer's camp responded saying, [...] "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She's not about to start listening to them now". The show in Paris at L'Olympia was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics, {{with most of the}} criticism centering {{on the fact that the}} concert lasted only 45 minutes, even though the tickets had been sold at the same price as for the other MDNA Tour shows and fans hadn't been alerted of the abbreviated format of the show. Responding to the criticism, Madonna's publicist declared that her past club shows [...] "were never more than 45 minutes", adding that the concert was [...] "planned as a heartfelt thank you to France which she expressed at the start of the show" [...] and also, the show cost Madonna nearly $1 million to produce and keeping the prices at $100 involved a [...] "tremendous effort". Madonna's concert in Warsaw was met with criticism from local religious conservatives who demanded her concert to be cancelled on the basis that the singer is against the church, desecrates religious iconography, promotes homosexuality, <b>transsexuality</b> and transvestism and generally displays abnormal and offensive behavior.
