Of the various vaccines strategies, one viable option is the development of live mycobacterial vaccines. A meeting with researchers, regulatory bodies, vaccines developers and manufactures was held to consider the challenges and progress, which has been achieved with live mycobacterial vaccines (either modified BCG or attenuated M. tuberculosis). Discussion led to the production of a consensus document of the proposed entry criteria for Phase I clinical trials of candidate live mycobacterial vaccines. The vaccine must be characterised thoroughly to prove identity and consistency, as clinical <b>trial</b> <b>lots</b> are prepared. In pre-clinical studies, greater protective efficacy as well as improved safety potential relative to BCG should be considered when assessing potential vaccine candidates. A standard way to measure the protective efficacy to facilitate comparison between vaccine candidates was suggested.

When entering Phase I trials, enrolment should be based upon an acceptable characterisation of the study population regarding mycobacterium status and exclude HIV+ individuals.

This trial concerns India's approach to addressing {{an increase in}} malaria-attributable deaths by training community health workers to diagnose, treat and prevent malaria, while using LQAS to monitor sub-district performance and make programme improvements. METHODS The Ministry of Health introduced LQAS into four matched high malaria burden districts (Annual Parasite Incidence > 5) (N > 5 million). In each sub-district, we sampled four populations in three 6 -monthly surveys: households, children < 5 years, people with fever in the last 2 weeks and community health workers. In three districts, trained local staff collected, analysed and used data for programme management; in one control district, non-local staff collected data and did not disseminate results. For eight indicators, we calculated the change in proportion from survey one to three and used a Difference-in-Differences test to compare the relative change between intervention and control districts. RESULTS Coverage increased from survey one to three for 24 of 32 comparisons. Difference-in-Differences tests revealed that intervention districts exhibited significantly greater change in four of six vertical strategies (insecticide treated bed-nets and indoor residual spraying), one of six treatment-seeking behaviours and four of 12 health worker capacity indicators. The control district displayed greater improvement than two intervention districts for one health worker capacity indicator. One district with poor management did not improve.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{investigates the}} lives of {{unmarried}} women, who are expecting a child. The aim is to uncover what challenges these women faced, in society during the early 1900 s, on multiple levels. The inspiration of this study originates from the criminal acts, and the subsequent trial, of Dagmar Overby. Dagmar Overby {{is one of the}} most prolific serial killers in Danish history, the victims of her crimes were newborns whom she had taken into foster care. In 1921, she was convicted for the murders of eight children, during her <b>trial</b> a <b>lot</b> of critical claims arose. Her defender, Gottlieb Jacobsen, claimed that careless mothers and an inadequate society were partly to blame. Earlier studies within this field, have mainly focused on describing the life of Dagmar Overby and the subsequent trial. This study investigates Jacobsen’s claim, compared to what is known about the life of unmarried mothers during the period of 1900 - 1950. Through analysis of the circumstances of these women’s lives, and decisions the women made, the study takes a critical assessment of the claim. The study analyses {{the lives of}} unmarried women through themes such as economy, social life and laws. All of these themes are considered to be issues, which could force the unmarried mothers to kill their newborn or place them in foster care. The study investigates the lives of these women partly through original archive material from the trial, old newspaper articles, and through literature about women and child laws. The analysis of this material has led to the conclusion, that unmarried mothers faced plenty of obstacles, including: financial limitations, the risk of public humiliation, and laws that limited and stigmatised their way of life severely. All of these circumstances are considered to have influenced why some women chose to kill their newborn or place them in foster care...|$|R

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) was carried out to assess how many trials exist, what they cover, what they do not cover, the research gaps, provide a 'blue print' for future Cochrane Reviews and assist those making treatment recommendations by summarising the available RCT evidence, using descriptive statistics. The Cochrane Collaboration systematic review process {{formed the basis of}} the methodology, from which over 4000 studies were located via electronic database searches and hand searching of journals. A total of 292 trials were finally included covering 9 treatment groups and over 48 individual treatments. There are <b>lots</b> of <b>trials</b> covering <b>lots</b> of interventions but gaps are evident. However, there is evidence of a benefit in the treatment of atopic dermatitis with topical corticosteroids, psychological approaches, UV light, ascomycin derivatives, topical tacrolimus and oral cyclosporin. Treatments that show limited evidence of a benefit include non-sedatory antihistamines, topical doxepin, the oral antibiotic Cefadroxil on clinically infected AD, the topical antibacterial Mupirocin on clinically uninfected AD, Chinese herbs, hypnotherapy and biofeedback, massage therapy, dietary manipulation, house dust mite reduction, patient education, emollients, allergen antibody complexes of house dust mite and thymic extracts. Treatments that show no evidence of benefit include sedatory antihistamines, oral sodium cromoglycate, oral antibiotics on clinically uninfected AD, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, aromatherapy essential oils, borage oil, fish oil, evening primrose oil, enzyme-free clothes detergent, cotton clothing, house dust mite hyposensitisation, salt baths, topical coal tar, topical cyclosporin and platelet-activating-factor antagonist. When interpreting the conclusions of this thesis {{it is important to understand}} that lack of evidence does not equal lack of efficacy, particularly considering the interventions that are commonly in use today to treat atopic dermatitis that have not been subjected to RCTs, such as occlusive dressings, water softening devices and stress management among many others...|$|R

The best way {{is to find a}} good or an optimal design in the planning phase of a trial and then implement it in real life.

In this way one can find a design that is actually feasible in reality, efficient and scientifically useful, and can be conducted using an available budget. The design of trials with continuous-time survival endpoints has been studied for years, but very {{little is known about the}} design of trials with discrete-time survival endpoints. The latter trials are conducted in many fields of science, for instance, in social and behavioral science, because observations are often recorded at intervals or at discrete points in time due to practical, financial, or ethical reasons, and therefore, it is important to carefully investigate that trials. When they are conducted in experimental setting, one or more groups of subjects receive a treatment, and they are compared to a group of subjects that receives a standard treatment or no treatment at all. The compared treatment groups might have an equal number of subjects or some of the groups might have more participants relative to the other groups. Moreover, subjects can be recruited at the same or at different points in time, each of them can be followed for the same or for different length of time, and the follow up time can be short or long. Hence, the interest here is to find a good number of subjects in both groups, a number of subjects in the experimental group and a duration of the trial, i. e. the number of time periods that subjects are observed for. To investigate these quantities, the generalized linear model (GLM) with logistic or complementary log-log link function, and the continuous-time parametric survival distribution can be applied.

It gets pretty complicated."The largest on any state capitol grounds, the Tejano Monument honors native-born Texans of Hispanic descent since the year 1519, when Alonzo Alvarez de Pineda mapped the Texas Gulf Coast. Stevens estimates that the two longhorns weigh six to eight hundred pounds each: [...] "You can't learn this in art school. I learned it from a friend at a foundry in Fort Worth. It's kind of an apprenticeship. There's <b>lots</b> of <b>trial</b> and error, <b>lots</b> of looking, measuring, looking some more, welding, pounding. I've had to remelt a lot of pieces over my career. We make the sculptor look good, He's the artist and we're the artisans." ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{years ago}} {{starling}} problems in cattle feed lots exploded to economic proportions. In 1964 one northern California feed lot operator reported {{a loss of}} 1, 000 per day during the winter months. This resulted from daily activity of over a million starlings. Along with consuming and contaminating large amounts of cattle feed, the birds disturbed the cattle and prevented regular feeding habits. This reduced weight gains drastically. To combat what had become a state-wide problem, in 1962 a cooperative program between the California Department of Agriculture, the county agricultural commissioners, the United States Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, and the University of California was put into action. The early work consisted of field <b>trials</b> in feed <b>lots</b> located in Solano, Madera, Merced, and Contra Costa Counties to develop behavioral information and control methods. In northern California, McDougal 2 ̆ 7 s feed lot near Collinsvilie, Solano County, {{was selected as the}} field trial site. During winter of 1963 - 1964 the work consisted of bait preference trials and progressed to use of TEPP treated grain baits. This resulted in a calculated kill totaling 4 l 4, 000 starlings. Pilot control programs, under general supervision of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Wildlife Services, Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, were conducted at McDougal 2 ̆ 7 s feed lot during fall and winter of 1966 and 1967. The objective was to reduce the starling population to an economic tolerable number. To achieve this objective it was decided that, weather permitting, it would be necessary to have bait continuously exposed for starling consumption...|$|R
