The term coastal defense is the more <b>traditional</b> <b>term,</b> but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.|$|E

Rheme, dicisign, {{argument}} (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome, {{and regarded}} as very broadened {{versions of the}} <b>traditional</b> <b>term,</b> proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.|$|E
25|$|From the 18th century on, {{the term}} Ukraine becomes equally {{well known in}} the Russian Empire as the {{official}} and colonial term Little Russia. With the growth of national self-consciousness the significance of the term rose and it was perceived not only as a geographic but also as an ethnic name. In the 1830s, Nikolay Kostomarov and his Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Kiev started to use the name Ukrainians. Their work was suppressed by Russian authorities, and associates including Taras Shevchenko were sent into internal exile, but the idea gained acceptance. It was also taken up by Volodymyr Antonovych and the Khlopomany ('peasant-lovers'), former Polish gentry in Eastern Ukraine, and later by the 'Ukrainophiles' in Galicia, including Ivan Franko. The evolution of the meaning became particularly obvious {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The term is also mentioned by the Russian scientist and traveler of Ukrainian origin Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay (1846-1888). At the turn of the 20th century the term Ukraine became independent and self-sufficient, pushing aside regional self-definitions In the course of the political struggle between the Little Russian and the Ukrainian identitites, it challenged the <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> Little Russia ("Малороссия") and ultimately defeated it in the 1920s during the Bolshevik policy of Korenization and Ukrainization.|$|E

500|$|A {{probability}} measure is a finite measure, and the Shapley–Folkman lemma has applications in non-probabilistic measuretheory, {{such as the}} theories of volume and of vector measures. The Shapley–Folkman lemma enables a refinement of the Brunn–Minkowski inequality, which bounds the volume of sums {{in terms of the}} volumes of their summand-sets. The volume of a set is defined in terms of the Lebesguemeasure, which is defined on subsets of Euclidean space. [...] In advanced measure-theory, the Shapley–Folkman lemma has been used to prove Lyapunov's theorem, which states that the range [...] of a vectormeasure is convex. Here, the <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> [...] "range" [...] (alternatively, [...] "image") is the set of values produced by the function.|$|E
500|$|Fish are the gill-bearing aquatic craniate {{animals that}} lack limbs with digits. They form a sister {{group to the}} tunicates, {{together}} forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term [...] "fish" [...] is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a , but not a phylogenetic classification.|$|E

500|$|The Solent, {{a stretch}} of water that gave access to the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth, was {{considered}} vulnerable to attack. Two castles were built on the west and east sides of the River Medina, {{the entrance to the}} principal harbour of the adjacent Isle of Wight, and were intended to attack any enemy ships that might approach. The castles took their names from the <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> for this location, [...] "the Cowes". Constructed in 1539, the western fortification, which became known as West Cowes Castle, had a D-shaped bastion at the front, a round, two-storey keep at the rear and two low buildings on either side, all of which mounted artillery guns. The landward side was protected by a ditch [...] wide and a stone wall at least [...] wide at the top. It was built from limestone ashlar stone, which may have been recycled from the demolition of nearby Beaulieu Abbey, a consequence of Henry's recent dissolution of the monasteries.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the name bucintoro is obscure, but one {{possibility}} is that it is derived from the Venetian burcio, a <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> for a lagoon vessel, and in oro, meaning covered in gold. On the other hand, man of letters Francesco Sansovino (1521–1586) proposed, based on documents dating from 1293, that it was named after an earlier boat built at the Arsenale shipyard called the Navilium Duecentorum Hominum (Of Two Hundred Naval Men). It has also been suggested that the vessel was named after the ship Centaurus referred to by Virgil when describing the funeral rites observed by Aeneas to honour his father's death; the bucentaur was twice the size of the ship mentioned in the Aeneid. The name may also refer to trumpets and horns that were played on board. The term bucintoro was Latinized in the Middle Ages as bucentaurus on the analogy of an alleged Greek word βουκένταυρος (boukentauros) meaning [...] "ox-centaur", from βους (bous, [...] "ox") and κένταυρος (kentauros, [...] "centaur"). The common supposition was that the name derived from a creature of a man with the head of an ox, a figure of which served as the barge's figurehead. This derivation is, however, fanciful; the word βουκένταυρος is unknown in Greek mythology, and representations of the [...] "figurehead" [...] of the bucentaurs in fact depict the lion of St. Mark the Evangelist.|$|E
500|$|However, at this time, cladistics, which {{appeared}} in the 1950s, was starting to change scientists' approach to biological classification. Unlike previous methods, cladistics attempts to consider all the characteristics of an organism, rather than those subjectively chosen as most important. As a result, it gives less significance to unique or bizarre characteristics than to those that are shared, since only the latter can demonstrate relationships. Cladistics also emphasises the concept of a monophyletic group, in other words one that consists only of a common ancestor and all its descendants– for example it regards the <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> [...] "reptile" [...] as useless, since mammals and birds are descendants of different groups of [...] "reptiles", but are not considered [...] "reptiles". The concepts of crown groups and stem groups, first presented in English in 1979, are consequences of this approach. A crown group is a monophyletic group of living organisms, and a stem group is a non-monophyletic set of organisms that do not have all the shared features of the crown group but have enough to distinguish them clearly from close relatives of other crown groups– in very simple terms, they are [...] "evolutionary aunts" [...] of the organisms in the crown group. Phyla are crown groups, and {{the fact that some of}} their characteristics are considered defining features is simply a consequence of the fact that their ancestors survived while closely related lineages became extinct.|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} 'traditional terms' {{have long}} been seen as problematic and the argument continues about what precisely they might refer to. This article finds that there are essentially two different perspectives such {{that the notion of}} a 'part of speech' represents either a mental or a grammatical distinction. Accordingly, the problem with the <b>traditional</b> <b>terms</b> can be said to have arisen out of a conflation of these two perspectives. If we assume that the 'parts of speech' represent grammatical distinctions then the <b>traditional</b> <b>terms</b> are effectively meaningless, because from a grammatical perspective, the 'parts of speech' are not universal concepts.

2500|$|This symbol is used {{mostly by}} the {{so-called}} Ezker Abertzalea (Nationalist Left), who consider it [...] "the oldest {{symbol of the}} territory of Euskal Herria".
