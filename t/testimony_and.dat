5|$|During {{the short}} {{existence}} of the Council, it became involved with regulating the fur trade. The Council feared furs contaminated with smallpox would be exported outside the quarantine zone. The Council invited {{people involved in the}} fur trade from Keewatin, Manitoba, and even the United States government to discuss the matter. The purpose of the meeting was to solicit <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> gain the support of the industry, so that the Council could effectively draft, implement and enforce legislation.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that {{that had been a}} mistake. The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty to charges of riot and conspiracy to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> the possibility that White had died from a pre-existing thrombotic condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The revisionist {{perspective}} has subsequently {{been supported}} by his children, Maxim and Galina, and many Russian musicians. Volkov has further argued, both in <b>Testimony</b> <b>and</b> in Shostakovich and Stalin, that Shostakovich adopted {{the role of the}} yurodivy or holy fool in his relations with the government. Other prominent revisionists are Ian MacDonald, whose book The New Shostakovich put forward further revisionist interpretations of his music, and Elizabeth Wilson, whose Shostakovich: A Life Remembered provides testimony from many of the composer's acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|A {{petition}} {{was filed}} by King David Kalakaua and his sisters and brother-in-law, Lydia K. Dominis, Miriam K. Cleghorn and Archibald Scott Cleghorn, with a hearing set by Justice Lawrence McCully. In July 1878, Justices Harris, Judd and McCully heard Kalakaua's appeal. While the Justices {{felt that the}} claim of Kalakaua and his sisters had not been proven, they were impressed with that of Kilinahe (Kanaʻina's first cousin) and other claimants based on <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> witnesses. The court decreed that the estate be split into four equal shares: one quarter to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k); one quarter each to Pahua (w) and Kaahua (k); and one quarter to the widow and children of Kilinahe, who had died before the adjudication of his claim.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final <b>testimony,</b> <b>and</b> her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trial}} progressed however, Le Gris' {{testimony}} suffered several blows. The unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were, {{in the eyes}} of the court, a powerful reason why the charges were not invented. Then, even as the trial progressed, one of the men providing Le Gris' alibi, named Jean Beloteau, was arrested in Paris and charged with rape. This charge seriously undermined Beloteau's <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> Le Gris' defence. Finally, Carrouges himself offered counter-testimony in court that a healthy, strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris could certainly have made the 50mile trip without difficulty, even accounting for the snow.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and <b>Testimony,</b> <b>and</b> even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} <b>testimony,</b> <b>and</b> can choose to press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning {{the use of any}} language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling for the elimination of the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon {{are being}} held captive in their home by Zep, who is {{watching}} Adam and Lawrence through a camera behind a two-way mirror in the bathroom. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's <b>testimony,</b> <b>and</b> eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E
5|$|Police {{work and}} {{criminal}} prosecutions {{relied heavily on}} confessions, witness <b>testimony,</b> <b>and</b> apprehending perpetrators {{in the act of}} committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9km2) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.|$|E
5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's <b>testimony</b> <b>and</b> preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in tongues for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E
