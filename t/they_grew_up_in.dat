Taborn borrowed records from a public library and listened to public radio, discovering music from the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and Sun Ra, among others. As a youth he also listened to heavy metal and contemporary classical music, and identified commonalities among these disparate forms of music.|$|E

25|$|Some {{twelve years}} before Cecilia {{they had two}} sons (Alfred Young's great-uncles) in Demerara; they were Alexander (b. c1801-2) and James Douglas (b.

Douglas took his two sons (aged about 10 and 11) back to Scotland (probably by summer 1812), where they were educated in Lanark.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{importance}} on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas, {{which has been}} shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in outdoor education programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning. Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by invasive species. Reconnecting people with nature is especially important for conservation because there is a tendency for people to use the biodiversity present in the landscape <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> as a point of comparison for future trends (see Shifting baseline).|$|E

25|$|What {{industries}} children work in {{depends on}} if <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{a rural area}} or an urban area. Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors, washing cars, helping in construction sites, weaving clothing, and sometimes even working as exotic dancers. While children {{who grew up in}} rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals, and selling crops. Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers. To address the issue of child labour, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959. Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} Clough's {{conflict}} with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, {{the leaders of}} the First Division and Derby, who were struggling {{near the bottom of the}} Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match, however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 20. Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted, but in their first league game against Leeds they lose 50. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the construction of subjectivity from an analytical-binding perspective.

500|$|Cycling {{magazine}} wrote {{a scathing}} {{report on the}} [...] "scantiness" [...] of the outfit, complaining of loss of modesty and calling the feat a [...] "lamentable incident". Similarly, the Yorkshire Evening Post pointed out that cycling was not a pleasant sight for a man, but that a woman's [...] "abnormal hips" [...] made it worse. The publicity, despite being negative, helped improve women's rights with the suffragette movement in particular noting {{it was a big}} milestone. Further, it helped show that women need not be tied to the street that <b>they</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> and had a means to travel. Another effect of the publicity was that Reynolds received love letters, including a marriage proposal from a stranger who was apparently significantly older than her. Reynolds and her family took advantage of the celebrity status, with Reynolds promoting a number of female bicycles over the following years, always in rational cycling attire.|$|E

40|$|Almost by {{definition}} {{the concentration of}} poverty {{is associated with the}} concentration of family problems and less well functioning communities. Researchers have had no problem documenting that crime, drug abuse, mental health problems, and school failure are all disproportionately located in the poorer communities in the United States, especially in very poor neighborhoods. However, for the author, that correlation of low income communities and problem behavior or low achievement among children does not necessarily demonstrate that families and children behave differently because <b>they</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> low income communities...|$|R

Particularly for disadvantaged groups, there are also long-run effects on educational attainment. Peer effects; Ethnic enclaves; Immigration; School performance...|$|R
