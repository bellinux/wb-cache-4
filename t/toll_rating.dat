40|$|By {{assigning}} different <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> {{to different}} lanes during peak traffic hours, {{the demand for}} each lane of a road can be optimized. Lanes with lower travel times charge higher <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> which are paid by those drivers who have higher values of travel time (VTT) and who want to avoid conges-tion in the other lanes. Conversely, travel time for those drivers with lower values of travel times will increase as they select the lower priced and slower lanes. This research examines <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> that minimize {{the total value of}} travel time spent on the road under such a scenario. The optimum <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> are dependent on the total road volume and distribution of VTT. The results show that total saved value of travel time can easily reach 11 % of the total value of time spent traveling on the lanes when compared to a toll road with a uniform <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> for all lanes. These savings vary based on many factors including the number of travelers on urgent trips...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPublic private {{partnership}} (PPP) is {{a project}} delivery method which is used in many countries. The main advantage of this method compared with traditional methods is in the allocation of private funds which are used for providing public services and delivery of projects such as hospitals, schools, roads, and bridges. Under road PPP projects, a commonly used mechanism for the repayment of the private investment is the user charge system, i. e., charging tolls to the facility users. Although the <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> may be set by the government, there are certain constraints which the minimum <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> has to meet. These constraints are mainly related to financial parameters such as project's financial {{internal rate of return}} (IRR) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) which private investors evaluate during the decision making process. In other words, there is a minimum <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> required to attract private investments. In addition to the financial constraints, other project's parameters such as construction cost, concession life, or level of government subsidies also have an impact on <b>toll</b> <b>rates.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the relationship between the level of <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> and several project technical and financial parameters. A financial model included in the Toolkit for PPP in Roads and Highways, developed by the World Bank and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), is used as a tool to calculate <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> for various sets of input values. The approach which was chosen to test sensitivity of selected parameters to potential changes in input values (e. g., technical and financial parameters) is by estimation of elasticities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Toll</b> <b>rates</b> {{and traffic}} volumes (or demand) {{are the two}} major factors {{affecting}} revenue as well as investment strategies on toll roads. Although China has been experiencing dramatic growth in its highway systems dur-ing the past 10 years, {{there has been a}} lack of understanding in main-taining and operating its toll roads. Since most of the freeways in China are toll roads, it is necessary to establish a methodology for the toll road system based on the characteristics of China’s transportation systems and social economy. A methodology to determine the <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> for China’s <b>toll</b> road systems is introduced. Factors affecting the <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> are analyzed, including gross domestic product, total number of vehicles, growth rates of passenger and freight transport, and roadway conditions.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. I analyze how <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt electronic toll collection, under which tolls are automatically deducted as the car drives through the toll plaza, eliminating the need to hand over cash. A survey I conducted indicates that drivers are much less aware of <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> when they pay electronically. I find that, in steady state, <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without electronic toll collection. Two additional findings support {{the hypothesis that}} electronic toll collection increases the <b>toll</b> <b>rate</b> by decreasing its salience: following adoption of electronic toll collection, the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the toll declines (in absolute value), and toll setting behavior becomes less sensitive to the local election calendar. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. To do this, I analyze how <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt electronic toll collection. Unlike manual toll collection, in which the driver must hand over cash at the toll collection plaza, electronic toll collection automatically debits the toll amount as the car drives through the toll plaza, thereby plausibly decreasing the salience of the toll. I find robust evidence that <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> increase following the adoption of electronic toll collection. My estimates suggest that, in steady state, <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without electronic toll collection. Consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} decreased tax salience is responsible for the increase in <b>toll</b> <b>rates,</b> I also find evidence that the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the actual toll declines (in absolute value) following the adoption of electronic toll collection. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings. ...|$|R

5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract.

The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise <b>toll</b> <b>rates</b> without first consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|R
