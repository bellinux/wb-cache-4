50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{students}} must gain entry into medical school. MBBS qualification (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) takes {{four to six}} years depending on the student's route. The newly qualified physician must then complete foundation training lasting two years; this is a paid training program in a hospital or clinical setting covering a range of medical specialties including surgery. Junior doctors then apply to enter the neurosurgical pathway. Unlike most other surgical specialties, it currently has its own independent <b>training</b> <b>pathway</b> which takes around eight years (ST1-8); before being able to sit for consultant exams with sufficient amounts of experience and practice behind them. Neurosurgery remains consistently amongst the most competitive medical specialties in which to obtain entry.|$|E

30|$|Development of FGDP (UK) TSID {{guidelines}} {{has led to}} {{a significant}} improvement in the quality of postgraduate education in Dental Implantology in the UK.

50|$|Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) {{degrees in}} {{conducting}} {{provide an opportunity}} for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a terminal degree, and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the <b>training</b> <b>pathway</b> for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as youth orchestras, school orchestras and community orchestras.|$|E
40|$|Despite the ever-growing {{demand for}} implant {{treatments}} by patients, there is confusion {{about what the}} appropriate <b>training</b> <b>pathway</b> in implant dentistry should be. This {{is accompanied by a}} worrying lack of training at undergraduate level for correct patient selection and monitoring of implant cases. An unclear <b>training</b> <b>pathway,</b> inappropriate referrals and a 'hands-off' approach to patients with implants may be putting patients at risk. This article highlights these issues with a suggestion that the training should of course follow the current GDC guidelines, but goes further to suggest that the end point of training should be at diploma level as a minimum, either via a university route, or via the RCS Edinburgh Diploma in Implant Dentistry Examination...|$|E

30|$|Training in {{ultrasound}} {{of certified}} EP is a challenging problem since many physicians {{does not use}} it in every day practice. In USA, a survey performed in Connecticut in 2014 showed that 24 % used PoCUS {{on a daily basis}} [5]. In Europe, {{there is a lack of}} such information but the situation might not be quite different. However, PoCUS is now strongly recommended by Emergency Medicine Societies [1, 4, 10] and is an integrate part of the Emergency medicine curriculum [10]. The American College of Emergency Physicians has formalized the <b>training</b> <b>pathway</b> for EP without previous ultrasound skills [1]. It begins with a didactic course followed by an experiential phase of supervised ultrasounds. A similar PoCUS <b>training</b> <b>pathway</b> is proposed in United Kingdom [10].

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgery {{fellowship}} {{training has}} multiple paths. Prospective trainees and employers {{must understand the}} differences between training pathways. This study examines self-reported fellowship experiences and current scope of practice across three pathways. MethodsAn online survey was disseminated to 654 surgeons. These included active Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (AHPBA) members and recent graduates of HPB, transplant–HPB and HPB–heavy surgical oncology fellowships. ResultsA total of 416 (64 %) surgeons responded. Most respondents were male (89 %) and most were practising in an academic setting (83 %). 290 (70 %) respondents underwent formal fellowship training. Although fellowship experiences varied, current practice was largely similar. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and ultrasound were the most commonly identified areas of training deficiencies and were, respectively, cited as such by 47 % and 34 % of HPB-, 49 % and 50 % of transplant-, and 52 % and 25 % of surgical oncology-trained respondents. Non-HPB cases performed in current practice included gastrointestinal (GI) and general surgery cases (56 % and 49 %, respectively) for HPB-trained respondents, transplant and general surgery cases (87 % and 21 %, respectively) for transplant-trained respondents, and GI surgery and non-HPB surgical oncology cases (70 % and 28 %, respectively) for surgical oncology-trained respondents. ConclusionsFellowship training in HPB surgery varies by <b>training</b> <b>pathway.</b> Training in MIS and ultrasound is deficient in each pathway. The ultimate scope of non-transplant HPB practice appears similar across training pathways. Thus, <b>training</b> <b>pathway</b> choice is best guided by the training experience desired and non-HPB components of anticipated practice...|$|E

The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education - such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement - are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.|$|R
