5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pirates</b> {{have failed}} once in signing a draft pick. This {{occurred}} in 2012, when <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> selected RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a significant bonus which, {{according to new}} MLB rules, would have cost <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> a future draft pick. <b>The</b> <b>Pirates</b> will receive the 9th overall pick in the 2013 draft for their failure to sign Appel.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2010, Banister {{was named}} the Pirates' interim bench coach after Gary Varsho was fired by the organization. At {{the end of the}} 2010 season, <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> fired manager John Russell. Banister and Clint Hurdle were the two finalists for the position. <b>The</b> <b>Pirates</b> named Hurdle as their manager, and Banister {{was named the}}ir {{full-time}} bench coach. As <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> bench coach, Banister learned about sabermetrics from a quantitative analyst who traveled with the team. Banister learned to use quantitative data to inform his decisions on when <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> should employ defensive shifts in the field. He was initially chosen to manage Scottsdale in the AFL after the 2014 season, but he was replaced by Pirates' special assistant Frank Kremblas due to the possibility of <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> reaching the MLB postseason.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> re-hired Murtaugh, and Virdon remained on Murtaugh's coaching staff. Virdon coached <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> as they won the 1971 World Series. Due to health problems, Murtaugh retired after the 1971 season, and Virdon was named as his successor.|$|E

5|$|Virdon {{managed in}} Minor League Baseball until {{returning}} to <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> {{as a coach}} in 1968. He served as manager of <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> in 1972 and 1973, before becoming {{the manager of the}} Yankees in 1974. During the 1975 season, the Yankees fired Virdon, and he was hired by the Astros. After being fired by the Astros after the 1982 season, Virdon managed the Expos in 1983 and 1984. Virdon won The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award in 1974, his only full season working for the Yankees, and in 1980, while managing the Astros. He returned to <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> as a coach following his managerial career, and remains with <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> as a guest instructor during spring training.|$|E
5|$|Virdon {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> as the hitting coach under Jim Leyland in 1986, Leyland's {{first season as}} a manager. He took the position only when {{he was convinced that}} he would not succeed Leyland should <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> fire him. Following a contract dispute, <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> replaced Virdon with Milt May before the 1987 season.

As <b>the</b> <b>Pirate</b> painfully pulls <b>the</b> bolt out, the Knight gets up and swings at him with the morning star, grazing him and causing him to fall. However, <b>the</b> <b>Pirate</b> uses his blunderbuss to shoot the Knight, sending him flying backward. <b>The</b> <b>Pirate</b> runs off with the treasure chest, once again believing that he has killed the Knight. He reaches the shore and sees his ship in the distance. He groans, [...] "Oh, bloody hell" [...] as he realizes that the injured Knight is still following him. He fires his third flintlock pistol.

5|$|After the hijacking, Cofresí adopted Anne as his flagship. Although she is popularly {{believed}} to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebastian Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find <b>the</b> <b>pirates</b> but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against <b>the</b> <b>pirates</b> and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. <b>The</b> <b>pirates</b> docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tomás de Renovales. At this time <b>the</b> <b>pirates</b> sailed Anne towards Peñuelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofresí's last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas.|$|E

As a freshman, Alston was used by <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> coaching staff in tandem with sophomore teammate David Garrard as a quarterback. As Garrard's usage increased going into his junior and senior years, <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> coaching staff tried out Alston at several different positions. After starting the 2001 season as a running back, Alston was converted mid-season to a wide receiver, the position {{in which he would}} play out the rest of his college and professional careers. In his final year with <b>the</b> <b>Pirates,</b> Alston led the team with 702 receiving yards on 36 catches, adding six touchdowns.|$|E

The 1973 Pirates had to play without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with Ellis and Richie Hebner, and <b>the</b> <b>Pirates</b> fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E
