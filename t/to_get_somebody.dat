Matheos and Moore sent him the track {{they wanted him}} to work on, and he sent back a rough mix of his vocals. [...] "We were really happy with it," [...] Moore said. [...] "We didn't do any {{revisions}} or ask for any changes, like we were expecting to... It was a different approach than I would have taken, and that's what was refreshing about it. That's why we wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> else to do some vocals on the album." [...] Tim Bowness of No-Man wrote lyrics and performed vocals on [...] "No Celebrations", a bonus track.|$|E
500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It {{never occurred to me}} to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, like most of the movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> else to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrne was {{at first}} {{reluctant}} but later agreed, and delivered the merchandising contract to Jacobs's office on 4 December 1963, leaving blank the percentages. Jacobs asked Byrne what percentage rate he should write down to which Byrne ambiguously replied: [...] "Oh, look, just put in 10%." [...] A typical percentage would have been 75% or 80% for NEMS, and Byrne expected Epstein would begin to negotiate. However, the contract came back initialled (meaning Epstein had read it) and signed by Epstein and Jacobs. Jacobs's advice to Epstein was, [...] "10% is better than nothing". This lapse of shrewdness set the scene for what would later become a legal battleground which deprived the Beatles and Brian Epstein of such {{large sums of money}} they would have easily overshadowed any royalties they would receive in the medium term from the sale of records. Byrne later said: [...] "They couldn't wait <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> else to do this, because they were in a mess themselves." [...] Epstein would later realise that he had made a colossal error of judgment, as Byrne charged 10% commission to the merchandisers for a licence (receiving $10 out of every hundred) and then giving 10% of that to NEMS, which was $1.|$|E

500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E
500|$|... "The Broken Man" [...] {{was written}} by Bryan Cogman. his second of two episodes for the season, the first being the {{previous}} episode, [...] "Blood of My Blood". It also adapts the chapter [...] "Jaime VI" [...] from A Feast for Crows. The title of the episode is in reference to a speech given by Septon Meribald, a character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, who was also used to create the character of Ray. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cogman stated, [...] "The speech itself didn't {{make it into the}} episode, but it inspired the character and some of his dialogue. So the title of the episode is a nod to that speech." [...] He compared it to the second season episode [...] "The Ghost of Harrenhal", whose title was also a reference to the books, but was not specifically stated in the episode. Ian McShane, who portrayed Ray, spoke about the writing in the episode in regards to his participation in the series, noting, [...] "they wrote a two-page speech – so that's why they invited me. It’s a big soliloquy, like in Deadwood, and they needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> who could do that. It was really well written." ...|$|E

Said Burke, [...] "I had already learned that the CNO could not just give an order and expect to have it carried out. He had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> who was {{in agreement with the}} project, who was just as enthusiastic about it, who was capable of running it without supervision, who could get things done, and who could use the authority delegated him wisely to take charge of the project.

However, on January 11, 2010, de Luca confirmed that work on a Metal Gear film adaptation was postponed indefinitely. He said Konami expressed concern that the entire Metal Gear franchise could be seriously affected if a movie version performed poorly. In March 2012, during The Art of Video Games exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Hideo Kojima stated, [...] "Honestly, I'm a movie fan and that's very special to me. I honestly would love to make a movie someday, but that said, I {{think it has to be}} a certain special game that has to provide that right setting. But I don't think that game will be Metal Gear Solid. Metal Gear Solid was developed specifically to become a game. ...If it were to be made into a movie it would have to be something completely new. I wouldn't use my current scripts. I think I'd have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>somebody</b> to get a new script and somebody else to direct it as a movie." [...] At the Metal Gear 25th Anniversary on August 30, 2012, Hideo Kojima announced that Arad Productions, owned by Arad brothers Avi and Ari, have agreed to produce a movie version of Metal Gear Solid with Columbia Pictures. Columbia's parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, will be in charge of distribution. On June 3, 2014, Deadline reported that Sony are eyeing Jordan Vogt-Roberts to direct the film. On March 30, 2015, Sony Pictures announced that Jay Basu will write the screenplay. In February 2017, Vogt-Roberts said the filmmakers are working on the film's script with Kojima and making it either an R or a PG-13 film rating.|$|E
