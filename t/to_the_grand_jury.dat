5|$|The county {{facilities}} in the bailey were expanded during these years, with improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> House and the Common Hall, but by the 1680s {{the role of the}} military garrison at York Castle was being called into question. Sir Christopher Musgrave produced a report for the Crown in 1682; he argued that it would cost at least £30,000 to turn the castle into a modern fortification, producing a proposal for the six bastions that such a star fort would require. This work was never carried out. Meanwhile, the garrison and the castle had become extremely unpopular with the people of York, who disliked both the cost and the imposition of external authority.|$|E
25|$|In July 1906, a broad {{investigation}} into {{violation of the}} eight-hour day law by the Pennsylvania Bridge Company was begun by federal inspectors. The company was indicted on July 28, and plead not-guilty. On October 1, city attorneys charged the company with additional violations of the eight-hour law.

The grand jurors complained to D.C. criminal court, which threatened the company with contempt of court.

25|$|The New York Court of Appeals, in People v.

The court agreed with the prosecutor that an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical reasonable person, is also required. The appeals court further held that Judge Crane's opinion that the testimony of Canty and Ramseur was perjurious was speculative and inappropriate. All charges were reinstated, and the case was sent to trial.|$|E

50|$|In {{that era}} most {{criminal}} prosecutions {{were conducted by}} private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen.

25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury {{that by the time}} Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA.

500|$|The {{criminal}} {{case against the}} Black Sox defendants suffered unexpected setbacks, with evidence vanishing, {{including some of the}} incriminating statements made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> The prosecution was forced to dismiss the original indictments, and bring new charges against seven of the ballplayers (McMullin was not charged again). Frustrated by the delays, Landis placed all eight on an [...] "ineligible list", banning them from major and minor league baseball. Comiskey supported Landis by giving the seven who remained under contract to the White Sox their unconditional release. Public sentiment was heavily against the ballplayers, and when Jackson, Williams, Felsch, and Weaver played in a semi-pro game, The Sporting News mocked the 3,000 attendees, [...] "Just Like Nuts Go to See a Murderer".|$|E
500|$|The Grand Jury Clause does very little, if anything, to {{regulate}} the procedures of the grand jury. For example, the Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence. Non-fundamental flaws with the grand jury, such {{as a violation of}} the defendant's self-incrimination rights or a violation of grand jury secrecy do not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have required [...] "substantial exculpatory evidence" [...] to be presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation. The lack of a grand jury does not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the grand jury right.|$|E
