500|$|The {{band members}} often {{did not play}} their {{standard}} instruments when working on the songs for Rock Steady. As a result, the album's instrumentation contains less guitar and bass guitar than the band's previous work. Many of the album's sounds come from electronic keyboard effects, which bassist Tony Kanal called [...] "Devo-y bleeps and Star Wars noises". Dumont commented {{that many of the}} effects came from being unfamiliar with the equipment and [...] "just <b>twiddling</b> knobs". Dumont created an effect similar to that of an echo chamber by placing a microphone inside a metal garbage can with the can's open end facing a drum kit. Richard B. Simon of MTV News asserted that the sound of Rock Steady was part of the decade nostalgia of the 1980s retro movement.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Olympic and Morgan Studios in London, England; A, Quantum, Sunset, Mirror Sound and Mystic Studios in Los Angeles, California; Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee; A, Juggy Sound, Groove and Mayfair Studios in New York City; and the [...] "hut" [...] in Vancouver. Production was entirely credited to Jimmy Page, while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the skills and recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer. [...] Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis wrote of the album's production, stating [...] "That the album {{turned out to be}} such a triumph, in particular for a production quality that still sounds fresh today, was in no small way due to the successful alliance with Page and Kramer in the control room." [...] This partnership was particularly exhibited in the central section of the track [...] "Whole Lotta Love". Kramer later said, [...] "The famous Whole Lotta Love mix, where everything is going bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console <b>twiddling</b> every knob known to man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Geisel's {{illustrations}} often convey motion vividly. He {{was fond}} of a sort of [...] "voilà" [...] gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in One Fish Two Fish when he creates fish (who perform the gesture themselves with their fins), in {{the introduction of the}} various acts of If I Ran the Circus, and in the introduction of the [...] "Little Cats" [...] in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were <b>twiddling</b> their thumbs.|$|E
60|$|He had {{all those}} violent adjuncts to speech we Western Europeans have abandoned, shruggings of the shoulders, waving of the arms, {{thrusting}} {{out of the}} face, wonderful grimaces and <b>twiddlings</b> of the hands under your nose until you wanted to hit them away. Day after day it went on, and I had to keep any anger to myself, to reserve myself for the time ahead {{when it would be}} necessary to see the quap was got aboard and stowed--knee deep in this man's astonishment. I knew he would make a thousand objections to all we had before us. He talked like a drugged man. It ran glibly over his tongue. And all the time one could see his seamanship fretting him, he was gnawed by responsibility, perpetually uneasy about the ship's position, perpetually imagining dangers. If a sea hit us exceptionally hard he'd be out of the cabin in an instant making an outcry of inquiries, and he was pursued by a dread of the hold, of ballast shifting, of insidious wicked leaks. As we drew near the African coast his fear of rocks and shoals became infectious.|$|R
2500|$|The song is in {{compound}} AABA form. Page came up {{with the}} guitar riff for [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] in the summer of 1968, on his houseboat along the Thames in Pangbourne, England. Playing the loose blues riff for the intro, on a Sunburst 1958 Les Paul Standard guitar which ascends into the first chorus. Then, beginning at 1:24 (and lasting until 3:02) the song dissolves to a free jazz-like break involving a theremin solo and a drum solo and the orgasmic moans of Robert Plant. As audio engineer Eddie Kramer has explained: [...] "The famous Whole Lotta Love mix, where everything is going bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console <b>twiddling</b> every knob known to man." [...] Kramer is also quoted as saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|During this time, {{the band}} issued a {{greatest}} hits collection, Monuments and Melodies (2009), Boyd recorded and released a solo album, The Wild Trapeze (2010), Einziger studied music theory and composition {{as well as}} evolutionary biology at Harvard University, Kenney recorded another solo album, and drummer Jose Pasillas became a father. Upon the band's return, Boyd noted, [...] "We weren't sitting at home <b>twiddling</b> our thumbs or anything; all of us {{had a lot to}} do. And eventually, {{it got to the point}} where it was like, 'It's time'." [...] Regarding their reunion, Einziger stated, [...] "I think just the gravity of my friendships with the guys in the band is really what caused [...] to happen - our friendships with each other." [...] The band subsequently reconvened in August 2010 to begin work on their next studio album.|$|E
2500|$|Clayton's bass guitar {{was heavily}} processed, {{to the point}} that it sounded like a {{keyboard}} bass (an instrument utilized on [...] "Mofo"). The Edge wanted to steer away from the image he had since the 1980s as having an echo-heavy guitar sound. As a result, he was enthusiastic about experimenting with his guitar's sound, hence the distorted guitar sounds on the album, achieved with a variety of effects pedals, synthesisers and knob <b>twiddling.</b> Bono was very determined to avoid the vocal style present on previous (especially 1980s) albums, characterized by pathos, rich timbre, a sometimes theatrical quality and his use of falsetto singing: instead he opted for a rougher, more nervous and less timbre-laden style. The production team made his voice sound more intimate, as up-front and raw as possible. As Flood explained, [...] "You get his emotional involvement with the songs through the lyrics and the way he reacts to the music—without him having to go to 11 all the time... We only used extreme effects on his voice during the recording, for him to get himself into a different place, and then, gradually, we pulled most effects out." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Twiddling</b> a small object, a door-key of {{peculiar}} make, in his hand, {{he grinned}} stolidly at me.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} all {{over a small}} rocking-chair, <b>twiddling</b> his thumbs and smiling, with {{his feet on the}} fender.|$|E
6000|$|No answer! And pouting, {{she stood}} <b>twiddling</b> the gardenia. Then {{suddenly}} she thought: 'I'll {{put it in}} his buttonhole! When he wakes up and sees it, how he'll jump!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'And now, {{what do you}} want?" [...] says she, seating {{herself in}} front of her desk, and leaving him standing, first on one leg and then on the other, <b>twiddling</b> his hat in his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] resumed Mont, <b>twiddling</b> his straw hat, {{while his}} hair, ears, eyebrows, {{all seemed to}} stand up from excitement, [...] "when you've been through the War you can't help being in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said it {{was like}} a light of {{blackness}} turned on us," [...] cried the girl, <b>twiddling</b> her ring. [...] "That must have been when the tall one thought worst about her sister and the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soames smiled faintly. [...] "You see," [...] resumed Mont, <b>twiddling</b> his straw hat, {{while his}} hair, ears, eyebrows, {{all seemed to}} stand up from excitement, [...] "when you've been through the War you can't help being in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Griggs {{looked at}} his card, then looked at Rachel, then looked at Mrs. Cornbury, and stood <b>twiddling</b> the bunch of little gilt playthings that hung from his chain. [...] "That is too hard," [...] said he; [...] "deuced hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ashurst did not answer; he had {{plucked a}} blue floweret, and was <b>twiddling</b> {{it against the}} sky. A cuckoo began calling from a thorn tree. The sky, the flowers, the songs of birds! Robert was talking through his hat! And he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One has to wait {{a little}} and see." [...] Then {{there was a long}} pause, during which Harry stood <b>twiddling</b> his fingers. He had nothing farther to suggest, but he thought that his uncle might say something. [...] "Shall I come again to-morrow, Uncle Prosper?" [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have done}} no harm by being laggards. I {{would like for}} you to explain how we might have been advantaged by {{awakening}} at daybreak and sitting here waiting for you to come? It seems to me just as well that we should sleep, as sit around <b>twiddling</b> our thumbs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, <b>twiddling</b> round his wife's card, [...] "you are bent on {{becoming}} a fine lady. You pester my poor old life out to get you into the world. You won't {{be able to hold}} your own there, you silly little fool. You've got no money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes indeed! You were in {{a towering}} rage. Do you remember? It was when you {{discovered}} that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantel-piece, <b>twiddling</b> the things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I must say----" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was going}} along the rocks in three-fathom water, {{watching}} the pollock catch prawns, and the wrasses nibble barnacles off the rocks, shells and all, {{when he saw}} a round cage of green withes; and inside it, looking very much ashamed of himself, sat his friend the lobster, <b>twiddling</b> his horns, instead of thumbs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, Baas," [...] he answered, <b>twiddling</b> his hat, [...] "I {{had grown}} to be fond of the white man, Bena, who was always very kind to me and did not treat me like dirt as low-born whites are apt to do. Also he cooked well, and now I shall {{have to do that}} work which I do not like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hauthor of 'Don Juan,' 'Child 'Arold,' and 'Cain, a Mystery,'" [...] said Pogson:--"I do; {{and hearing}} the waiter calling you Madam la Bironn, took the liberty of hasking whether you were {{connected}} with his lordship; that's hall:" [...] and my friend here grew dreadfully red, and began <b>twiddling</b> his long ringlets in his fingers, and examining very eagerly {{the contents of his}} plate.|$|E
60|$|The moon-cat, who had now {{reached his}} shoulder, brushed {{the tip of}} her tail across his loose right eyebrow, while Blink's jealous tongue avidly licked his high left cheekbone. With one hand Mr. Lavender was cuddling the cat's head, with the other <b>twiddling</b> Blink's forelock, and the watchers could see his eyes shining, and his white hair {{standing}} up all ruffled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Pen, <b>twiddling</b> {{the stalks}} of the strawberries, [...] "I--I," [...] but this {{sentence}} never finished; for Pen's face was so comical and embarrassed, as the Major watched it, that the elder could contain his gravity no longer, {{and burst into}} a fit of laughter, in which chorus Pen himself was obliged to join after a minute: when he broke out fairly into a guffaw.|$|E
60|$|He {{was thus}} seated, <b>twiddling</b> the queer {{manuscript}} in his hand, joking grimly to himself, when his servant {{came in with}} a card from a gentleman, who wished to speak to him very particularly. And if Pen had gone out into the passage, he would have seen, sucking his stick, rolling his eyes, and showing great marks of anxiety, his old acquaintance, Mr. Samuel Huxter.|$|E
60|$|This {{was such}} an entirely new view of the Terpsichorean art as {{socially}} practised, that Mrs Lammle looked at her young friend in some astonishment. Her young friend sat nervously <b>twiddling</b> her fingers in a pinioned attitude, {{as if she were}} trying to hide her elbows. But this latter Utopian object (in short sleeves) always appeared to be the great inoffensive aim of her existence.|$|E
60|$|Through one {{of these}} window-places I saw at a little {{distance}} {{the slope of the}} forest-covered hill, which reminded me of something to do with a child--for the life of me I could not remember what. As I lay wondering over the matter I heard a shuffling step which I recognized, and, turning, saw Hans <b>twiddling</b> a new hat made of straw in his fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So are ours; {{but good}} clothes alone don't make a gentleman here. We require {{a good deal}} more,' flashed Josie, in arms at once to defend her college. 'You will hear {{of some of the}} men in [...] "old boots and grey flannel" [...] when you and your fine gentlemen are <b>twiddling</b> your ties and scenting your hair in obscurity. I like old boots and wear them, and I hate dandies; don't you, Bess?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{ought to}} have been firm, but I thought that perhaps he really did know {{something}} about the business. I went to the tool shed to see what I could find. When I came back {{he was sitting on the}} ground with the front wheel between his legs. He was playing with it, <b>twiddling</b> it round between his fingers; the remnant of the machine was lying on the gravel path beside him.|$|E
6000|$|... "'En efet,' {{says the}} Marky, <b>twiddling</b> his little black mustachios in the chimney-glass, {{and making a}} lunge or two {{as he used to}} do at the fencing-school. (He was a wonder at the fencing-school, and I've seen him knock down the image {{fourteen}} times running, at Lepage's.) 'Let us speak of affairs. Colonel, you understand that affairs of honour are best settled at once: perhaps it won't be inconvenient to you to arrange our little matters of last night.' ...|$|E
60|$|And it didn't. I {{could see}} exactly what must have happened. Insert a liberal dose of mixed spirits in a {{normally}} abstemious man, and he becomes a force. He does not stand around, <b>twiddling</b> his fingers and stammering. He acts. I {{had no doubt that}} Gussie must have reached for the Bassett and clasped her to him like a stevedore handling a sack of coals. And one could readily envisage the effect of that sort of thing on a girl of romantic mind.|$|E
60|$|Fitz has a {{very pretty}} wit of his own, and a good {{reputation}} on circuit; but he is timid before great people. And indeed the presence of that awful Lady Bungay on his right hand was enough to damp him. She was in court mourning (for the late Prince of Schlippenschloppen). She had on a large black funereal turban and appurtenances, and a vast breastplate of twinkling, <b>twiddling</b> black bugles. No wonder a man could not be gay in talking to HER.|$|E
60|$|Though I had {{not told}} Elsie, {{the truth of the}} matter was, I had just then {{conceived}} an idea for a novel--my magnum opus--the setting of which compelled Egyptian local colour; and I was therefore dying to get to Egypt, if chance so willed it. I submitted a few of my picked manuscripts accordingly to Mr. Elworthy, in fear and trembling. He read them, cruel man, before my very eyes; I sat and waited, <b>twiddling</b> my thumbs, demure but apprehensive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone home. I've {{just seen}} her {{off in a}} cab. She's gone back to Washington Square to pack. She's {{catching}} the ten o'clock train back to Snake Bite. It was that damned song!" [...] muttered Bill, in a stricken voice. [...] "She says she never realised before she sang it to-night how hollow New York was. She said it suddenly came over her. She says she's {{going to give up}} her career and go back to her mother. What the deuce are you <b>twiddling</b> your fingers for?" [...] he broke off, irritably.|$|E
60|$|Since the {{beginning}} no {{woman has been}} a mystery to another woman. Swift as light travels, each penetrates the heart and mind of another, sifts her sister's words of their cunningest disguises, reads her most hidden desires, and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from a comb, <b>twiddling</b> them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt. Long ago Eve's son rang the door-bell of the family residence in Paradise Park, bearing a strange lady on his arm, whom he introduced. Eve took her daughter-in-law aside and lifted a classic eyebrow.|$|E
