500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein".

[...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park.

Upon its release, Chris Phillips from the Live at the Vault show on BRfm 97.3 called it one of the best albums of the year. Luke McNaney of The Music Fix rated it 8/10 and praised the album, using terms like [...] "swooning melodies", [...] "beguilingly sexy rock", and [...] "prowling guitars". He appreciated the final third of the album the most, and declared [...] "the band have proved their belltower remains a den of intoxicating noise." [...] Scott Causer of Contactmusic rated it 7/10 and expected to hear Stoermer produce an album full of indie anthem pop songs, similar to those of The Killers, but was surprised to instead hear a darker creation. He ended his review by stating that [...] "Howling Bells {{are one of the most}} interesting bands in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and should be cherished as such." [...] Tom O'Donovan of V Music acknowledged that Juanita stood out from her female-fronted counterparts and praised her vocal capacity for its diverse range. He referred to The Loudest Engine as [...] "a promising record displaying a real maturity." [...] Denis Semchenko of Rave Magazine rated the album 3.5/5 and noted that the opening track [...] "Charlatan" [...] and lead single [...] "Into the Sky" [...] were among the band's most distinguished guitar riffs yet, although he thought the album would have benefited from more stylistic diversity.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's going on in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because {{you feel like a}} veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E

We concur with their comment {{that there is a}} paucity of data on pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive disease in this region of <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays to enhance the serotype determination of pneumococci in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as the one we have developed, are potentially important new tools with particular use where frequent over the counter antibiotic use before hospital presentation reduces the yield of culture.

40|$|Housing {{rights are}} {{becoming}} significant {{as a tool}} for highlighting needs and raising housing standards across <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> These <b>rights</b> are <b>now</b> an integral part of economic, social, and cultural rights within international human rights instruments, while the right to adequate housing is recognised legally at national and international levels. Among the methods of implementing these rights the “Human Rights Based Approach” (HRBA) is used by NGOs, community organisations and rights advocates. Many housing rights issues arise in relation to standards in social housing, urban regeneration and social housing policy development. This article examines a case study where the HRBA has been applied by local authority tenants in partnership with community development organisations and supported by human rights expertise to campaign for improvements to substandard housing conditions and deprivation within a Dublin inner city social housing estate. It appraises the adoption of the HRBA as a response to inadequate housing conditions and delayed regeneration programmes. The impact of poor housing on the health of tenants was an integral element of the arguments used. The outcomes of using the HRBA for the rights holders (the tenants) are assessed. Overall, this campaign led to significant improvements in conditions. The factors underlying the success centred on {{the way in which the}} HRBA framework, with its focus on measurable indicators of human rights violations, enabled community development organisations to create a human rights based public campaign that exerted considerable political pressure through the empowerment of tenants, leveraging of human rights experts, and considerable media publicity. The development of solutions in parallel with the local authority was also important. This approach transcended many established NGO and State approaches to addressing poverty...|$|R

Consultants have had an important role in establishing strategy in the field of management as well as in distributing management concepts and knowledge on strategy to their clients across the globe. This this thesis aims to gather in-depth insight on how three leading consultancies, McKinsey & Company, The Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company, approach the concept of strategy today. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify how leading strategy consultancies define strategy and analyze what they highlight as the most important strategic issues in <b>the</b> business <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>The</b> study also seeks to find out what kind of similarities and differences these top-tier consultancies have in their strategy views, expertise and their overarching approach to strategy consulting. The literature review discusses earlier research in the fields of strategy and management consulting. Both fields have evolved extensively and have been strongly bound together during their histories. The literature review sheds some light on the evolution of strategy as a management concept, introducing different approaches that researchers have taken to strategy during its history as dominant management practice. The second half of the review focuses on management consulting, introducing the reader to the history of consulting and discussing different views researchers have had on consultant-client relationships, strategy consultancies as distributors of management ideas and some more recent changes in the field of consulting. The empirical research in this thesis is conducted as a multiple case study, in which the three leading strategy consultancies, McKinsey & Company, The Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company, act as individual cases. The research data is collected from the official websites of the case companies, with strict focus on the sections discussing the strategy expertise areas of each company. The individual cases are first analyzed using thematic content analysis. After this phase, a cross-case analysis is conducted between the three individual cases. The three cases are compared according to their views on three themes that emerged from the analysis on the individual cases. The study indicates that the leading strategy consultancies approach strategy and the burning topics in it today and in the future through similar themes. However, while the themes are to a great extent the same from one consultancy to another, the angle with which they approach the issues and the intensity with which they emphasize them varies greatly, as does the overarching view on strategy work at large. The findings also suggest that traditional macro-level views on strategy and consulting are still strongly integrated in many of the views and operations of these consultancies. However, the more contemporary micro-level approaches are also gaining a foothold among the companies, making their advices to managers as well as their operations as consultants a mixture of old and new approaches...|$|R

The better the curiosity and self-confidence of students, then students will be more motivated to learn. So the students will obtain a meaningful learning and get {{the results of the study}} are in accordance with the national education goals. The purpose of this research was to review; How big is the curiosity of students, how high the confidence of students, and how great the influence of curiosity and self-confidence of students toward outcome studied mathematics students. The research method used is the quantitative methods. The population in this research is grade VII MTs Negeri 1 Cirebon in the year 2014 / 2015 Lessons, with the number of students 1127 people. The technique of sampling using purporsive sampling. By using the selected sampling engineering 80 students to become respondents. The dwarf in the collection of data for the variable X is now with the spread against the target of research. As for the variable Y by using the test instrument. Then the data obtained were analyzed by using test normality, test its homogeneity, linierity test regression, autocorrelation test, and test the multikolinieritas as well as a test of the hypothesis. Based on the results of the analysis of the obtained an average score of curiosity is 59, 25 % by category and average score results of learning math is 69, 11 % with high category as well a the average score of studen learning outcomes i. e. 67, 81 % by category enough. The result statistical hypothesis test note that 11, 782 > 2, 37 the Ho are received. With equation regresion is 83. 866 + 0. 128 0. 364 x 1 + X 2 which means there are influences between curiosity and self-confidence of students toward outcome studied mathematics. Based on the determination of the magnitude of the influence coefficient is 4, 79 % meaning that curiosity and self-confidence of students gives only a small influence against the results of the study of mathematics students. While the rest of 95, 21 % is affected by other factors...|$|R
