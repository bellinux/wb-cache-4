5|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} {{promotion}} for the album, the band were asked what shows <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{to appear on}}. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to appear on Dance Party USA, since {{it was the most}} absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.|$|E

"Spendthrifts," by contrast, experience too little pain of paying and typically spend more than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> ideally <b>like</b> to spend. This article introduces and validates the "spendthrift-tightwad" scale, a measure of individual differences in the pain of paying. Spending differences between tightwads and spendthrifts are greatest in situations that amplify the pain of paying and smallest in situations that diminish the pain of paying.

5|$|Pod is {{the debut}} album by the American {{alternative}} rock band the Breeders, released on 4AD in May 1990. The group {{began when the}} Pixies' Kim Deal and Throwing Muses' Tanya Donelly became friends in 1988 and decided <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to create music together. Abandoning their initial idea of focusing on dance music, they recorded a country-influenced demo with musicians including violinist Carrie Bradley and bassist Ray Holiday in 1989. When 4AD cofounder Ivo Watts-Russell heard the demo, he offered them money to re-record the songs for an album release.|$|E
5|$|Sucker Punch began {{planning}} {{the game as}} early as 2010, when they began discussion with Sony to bring the Infamous series onto {{a new generation of}} hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to see on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did not use}} the 3D {{graphics}} which Armok {{had since}} its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{commercial}} success of Enamorada de Ti, Capitol Latin confirmed a trilogy of Selena remix/duet albums. In May 2012, Capitol Latin confirmed an English-language followup. By February 2012, Canadian singer Michael Bublé was confirmed as one of many other artists who expressed interest in recording a duet with Selena. In late August 2012, fans were asked {{to fill out a}} survey from the official Selena Facebook page, inviting them to choose three Latin singers and three non-Latin singers <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to see recording a duet with Selena on the follow-up album.

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E
5|$|Dueling Dragons {{was one of}} Islands of Adventure {{original}} attractions, {{opening with}} the theme park on May 28, 1999, in The Lost Continent area of the park. At the time, {{it was the only}} fully inverted dueling roller coaster in the world. The ride was themed to two dueling dragons. The queue was decorated to be a ruined castle that the two dragons destroyed, once the riders got to the station. They got to chose between which of the two coasters <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to experience. The blue coaster was named Ice and the other Red coaster was named Fire.|$|E

The band also stated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to set up an Australian tour during the summer and singer Brandan Schieppati stated in a reply to an Instagram comment that the band would have a final U.S. tour possibly starting in September. November 2013 the band announced final west coast dates will take place in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanics}} of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn. Most {{of these changes}} are geared toward reducing the randomness and guesswork involved in these processes. For Disciples of the Hand, all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the Crafting Log. Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For Disciples of the Land, players are allowed to select which item <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world.|$|E
5|$|During {{a reunion}} tour in summer 2008, The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe decided <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to work {{together}} again. Since their 1996 movie Brain Candy, during which they had a falling out over creative differences, they had only worked together on live comedy tours and had not appeared on television together {{since the end of}} their show in 1995. Bruce McCulloch pitched a television story idea which {{the rest of the group}} liked. They spent a couple days together brainstorming and developing characters. The storyline resolved into a murder mystery miniseries – partly inspired by the British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. McCulloch described it as Corner Gas meets Twin Peaks. The format diverged from their typical sketch comedy style by following a continuous narrative – though side-stories explore characters further. Along with producer Susan Cavin in fall 2008, they pitched the concept to CBC executive Fred Fuchs who greenlit the project.|$|E

In 2002, with a rhythm guitarist, they issued the Top50 album I'm Already Home. With four members, the band then toured Australia and New Zealand. Shortly thereafter, Brendan Picchio joined Waikiki as a bassist, and Juanita switched to rhythm guitar. The group soon became dissatisfied with its material, so the members chose a new direction for their music. They wrote {{a number of new}} songs and made a wish list of producers with whom <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to work. In 2004, the band changed its name to Howling Bells, as its members felt that phrase better embodied its newly adapted indie rock style.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras {{was used by the}} designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college. Meanwhile, disappointed at no longer being able to be The A-Team, Peter decides to become an unofficial A-Team alongside Joe, Cleveland, and Quagmire, and decide to help their local community. Peter designs a replica of the van used by The A-Team.|$|E
