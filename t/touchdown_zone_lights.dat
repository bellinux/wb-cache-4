50|$|The {{elevation}} for Runway 16 is 68.6 ft. The runway has a 4-aligned PAPI light system (glideslope: 2.83°), a MALSR approach light, centerline lights, and <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> <b>lights.</b> The runway has {{an instrument}} approach which includes S-ILS or LOC/DME, and GPS RNAV. For general aviation aircraft, the runway uses left traffic pattern.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{the modern}} Arrivals Terminal with the {{capacity}} of 750 passengers per hour was opened. Also in 2008, the lighting facilities were reconstructed and the new hi-intensity lighting system was installed: the centerline lights and the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> <b>lights.</b> In 2011, the airport handled over 1.6 million passengers, a 28% increase over 2010.|$|E
50|$|Runway 1-19 is 7000 ft {{long and}} 150 ft wide, with HIRL. Both runways 1 and 19 are {{equipped}} with REIL systems. Runway 1 approach {{is equipped with a}} VASI system. Runway 19 approach has an ILS and a Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI). Runway 1-19 was overlaid and grooved in the summer of 2000, and included the installation of centerline and <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> <b>lighting.</b> Runway 19 is the preferred runway for noise abatement procedures.|$|R
50|$|The east-west {{instrument}} runway (10-28) was extended {{from its original}} 5500 feet by the mid-1950s to 6863 feet {{and a few years}} later to 8000 feet. In 1958 the instrument landing system to runway 28 was augmented with a 3000 foot high-intensity approach lighting system. With the use of the Century series fighter aircraft by the Air Force, around 1960 the main east-west runway was extended again, to 9003 feet. The runway was strengthened in the early 1960s for the heavier Boeing 707. In the 1960s runway centerline lighting was added to the main runway and <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> <b>lighting</b> on the runway 28 end.|$|R
50|$|It is a class 4D airport. Runway 13-31 is 9186 {{feet long}} and 200 feet wide. It is {{equipped}} at both ends with Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), Approach Lighting Systems (ALS) with sequenced flashers, and <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> (TDZ) <b>lighting.</b> Both the Boeing 737-900 and Boeing 767-300ER aircraft are capable of landing there.|$|R
5000|$|Several ALS {{configurations}} {{are recognized}} by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); however, non-standard ALS configurations are installed at some airports. Typically, approach lighting systems are of high-intensity. Many approach lighting systems are also complemented by various on-runway light systems, such as Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL), <b>Touchdown</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Lights</b> (TDZL), and High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL). The most common approach light system configurations include: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1960, Rochester Municipal Airport {{opened at}} its current {{location}} 8 mi south of downtown Rochester. American Airlines began service to Chicago O'Hare in 1988. 1995 saw {{the addition of}} a US Customs post and it became the Rochester International Airport. TWA operated flights to St. Louis in early 2001, but these routes were dropped very soon due to the merger with American Airlines. On September 15, 2005, the primary runway was lengthened from 7,533' to 9,033' following a three-month closure for renovations. At the same time, runway centerline and <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> <b>lighting</b> were both added. The change was made primarily to accommodate large wide body aircraft, which were heavily weight-restricted upon departure prior to the extension.|$|R
50|$|The {{required}} minimum visibility for instrument approaches {{is influenced}} by the presence and type of approach lighting system. In the U.S., a CAT I ILS approach without approach lights will have a minimum required visibility of 3/4 mile, or 4000 foot runway visual range. With a 1400-foot or longer approach light system, the minimum potential visibility might be reduced to 1/2 mile (2400 runway visual range), and the presence of <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> and centerline <b>lights</b> with a suitable approach light system might further reduce the visibility to 3/8 mile (1800 feet runway visual range).|$|R
50|$|There are two {{parallel}} north-south runways and a disused cross runway. The western runway, 03L/21R, is over 4400 m (14,000 ft) long, {{making it one}} of the world's longest international airport runways. Fully laden aircraft require a far greater length of runway to achieve take-off velocity at this altitude. Both runways are equipped with Instrument Landing Systems (ILS). Furthermore all runways are equipped with Approach Lighting Systems. Sequenced flashers are not used at any South African runways and therefore not installed. <b>Touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> (TDZ) <b>lighting</b> is available, but never turned on. Runway Threshold, Edge and Centerline lights are the only lighting available. Runway 03R/21L is 3,400m (11,155 ft) long and is also equipped at both ends with ILS. The airport used to have a third runway but this was closed due to the danger it posed. It is now a taxiway.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} {{some other}} {{countries}} or territories (Hong Kong and Macau) all 3-stripe and 2-stripe <b>touchdown</b> <b>zones</b> for precision runways are replaced with one-stripe <b>touchdown</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some European {{countries}} {{replace the}} aiming point with a 3-stripe <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R
50|$|The runway is asphalt, with a 200 m {{concrete}} <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> on each end.|$|R
5000|$|Runways {{may have}} {{different}} types on each end. To cut costs, many airports do not install precision guidance equipment on both ends. Runways with one precision end and {{any other type of}} end can install the full set of <b>touchdown</b> <b>zones,</b> even if some are past the midpoint. Runways with precision markings on both ends omit <b>touchdown</b> <b>zones</b> within 900 ft of the midpoint, to avoid ambiguity over with which end the zone is associated.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{installations}} include medium- or high-intensity {{approach light}} systems (abbreviated ALS). Most often, these are at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have approach lights {{to support their}} ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the approach lighting system at the Decision Altitude allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without approach lights may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as 3/4 mile (runway visual range of 4,000 feet) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. Visibility minimums of 1/2 mile (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a 1400 to 3000 ft ALS, and 3/8 mile visibility 1800 ft visual range is possible if the runway has high-intensity edge <b>lights,</b> <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> and centerline <b>lights,</b> and an ALS that is at least 2400 ft long (see Table 3-5a in FAA Order 8260.3b). In effect, ALS extends the runway environment out towards the landing aircraft and allows low-visibility operations. CAT II and III ILS approaches generally require complex high-intensity approach light systems, while medium-intensity systems are usually paired with CAT I ILS approaches. At many non-towered airports, the pilot controls the lighting system; for example, the pilot can key the microphone 7 times {{to turn on the}} lights on the high intensity, 5 times to medium intensity or 3 times for low intensity ...|$|R

40|$|Realistic {{predictions}} of service life of steel catenary risers (SCR) require an accurate characterization of seafloor stiffness {{in the region}} where the riser contacts the seafloor, the so-called <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> This thesis presents the initial stage of development of a simplified seafloor support model. This model simulates the seafloor-pipe interaction as a flexible pipe supported {{on a bed of}} springs. Constants for the soil springs were derived from finite element studies performed in a separate, parallel investigation. These supports are comprised of elasto-plastic springs with spring constants being a function of soil stiffness and strength, and the geometry of the trench within the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> Deflections and bending stresses in the pipe are computed based on a finite element method and a finite difference formulation developed in this research project. The finite difference algorithm has capabilities for analyzing linear springs, non-linear springs, and springs having a tension cut-off. The latter feature simulates the effect of a pipe pulling out of contact with the soil. The model is used to perform parametric studies to assess the effects of soil stiffness, soil strength, trench geometry, amplitude of pipe displacements, pipe stiffness, and length of <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> on pipe deflections and bending stresses. In conclusions, the seafloor stiffness (as characterized by the three spring parameters), the magnitude of pipe displacement, and the length of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> all influence bending stresses in the pipe. Also, the tension cutoff effect, i. e., the pipe pulling away from the soil, can have a very large effect on bending stresses in the pipe. Neglecting this effect can lead to serious over-estimate of stress levels and excessive conservatism in design...|$|R
40|$|Simulated {{instrument}} approaches {{were made}} to Category 1 minimums followed by a visual landing on a 100 x 1700 ft STOL runway. Data were obtained for variations in the aircraft's flare response characteristics and control techniques and for different combinations of aircraft and runway lighting and a visual approach slope indication. With the complete aircraft and runway lighting and visual guidance no degradation in flying qualities or landing performance was observed compared to daylight operations. elimination of the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> floodlights or the aircraft landing lights led to somewhat greater pilot workload; however, the landing could still be accomplished successfully. Loss of both <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> and aircraft landing lights led to a high workload situation and only a marginally adequate to inadequate landing capability...|$|R

5000|$|By {{following}} controller {{commands to}} keep the landing aircraft on both glidepath and approach centerline, a pilot will arrive precisely over the runway's <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> In order to insure continuous radio communication integrity, controllers are required to make radio transmissions at certain minimum intervals {{depending on the type}} of approach flow and phase of the approach. In order to land, pilots must have the runway or runway environment in sight prior to reaching the [...] "decision height," [...] for PAR approaches (usually 100-400 ft above the runway <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone)</b> or prior to the [...] "Missed Approach Point" [...] for non-precision approaches. The published minimum visibility and decision height/minimum descent altitude vary depending upon the approach and runway lighting, obstacles in the approach corridor, type of aircraft, and other factors. Pilots of revenue flights periodically must demonstrate PAR approach proficiency, and GCA controllers must conduct a minimum number of such approaches in a year to maintain competency.|$|R

40|$|Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) is {{a popular}} {{solution}} for a floating production facility in the deep and ultra-deep ocean. In the analysis of SCR, the behavioral characteristics are investigated to check the failure modes by assessing the magnitude {{and the frequency of}} the stress and strain which SCR goes through in time series. SCR is affected by the motions of connected floating production facility and exciting environmental loads. The driven force and motion of SCR has an interaction with seabed soil which represents the stiffness and friction force where SCR touches the seabed. Dynamic response of SCR is primarily caused by the coupled motion of floating structure. The displacement of floating structure is often large and fast enough to cause short cycles of negative and positive tension on SCR. The interaction between SCR and seabed is concentrated at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone</b> resulting into the compression and corresponding deformation of pipeline at the position. This paper presents models of floating production facilities and connected mooring lines and SCRs in 100 -year hurricane environmental loads and seabed, focusing on the motional characteristics of SCR at the <b>touchdown</b> <b>zone.</b> In time series simulation, the model of SCR is first analyzed as a pipeline with indefinite elasticity so that the SCR does not fail even if the exciting loads exceed the property limit of SCR. Then the SCR design is manually checked using criteria for each failure mode to estimate the integrity...|$|R
