5|$|A {{classification}} of hepatic encephalopathy was introduced at the World Congress of Gastroenterology 1998 in Vienna. According to this classification, hepatic encephalopathy is subdivided in <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> B and C {{depending on the}} underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|Barycentric {{subdivision}} is {{an example}} of a subdivision rule with one edge type (that gets subdivided into two edges) and one tile <b>type</b> (<b>a</b> triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we start}} with a complex made of four quadrilaterals and {{subdivide}} it twice. All quadrilaterals are <b>type</b> <b>A</b> tiles.|$|E

5|$|Neither USB 1.0 nor 1.1 {{specified}} {{a design}} for any connector {{smaller than the}} standard <b>type</b> <b>A</b> or type B. Though many designs for a miniaturised type B connector appeared on many peripheral devices, conformance to the USB 1.x standard was fudged by treating peripherals that had miniature connectors {{as though they had}} a tethered connection (that is: no plug or socket at the peripheral end). There was no known miniature <b>type</b> <b>A</b> connector until USB 2.0 (rev 1.01) introduced one.|$|E
5|$|Type C: This Mini {{connector}} {{is smaller}} than the <b>type</b> <b>A</b> plug, measuring 10.42mm × 2.42mm but has the same 19-pin configuration. It is intended for portable devices. The differences are that all positive signals of the differential pairs are swapped with their corresponding shield, the DDC/CEC Ground is assigned to pin 13 instead of pin 17, the CEC is assigned to pin 14 instead of pin 13, and the reserved pin is 17 instead of pin 14. The type C Mini connector can be connected to a <b>type</b> <b>A</b> connector using a type A-to-type C cable.|$|E
5|$|While it was {{formerly}} considered a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus {{is now considered}} to belong its own monotypic oofamily, Cairanoolithidae. It belongs to the dinosauroid-spherulitic basic <b>type,</b> <b>a</b> group including sauropod eggs and ornithischian eggs, but paraphyletically excluding theropod eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{botulinum toxin}} <b>types</b> <b>A,</b> B, E, and F cause disease in humans. <b>Types</b> <b>A,</b> B, and E are {{associated}} with foodborne illness, with type E specifically associated with fish products. Type C produces limberneck in birds and type D causes botulism in other mammals. No disease is associated with type G. [...] The [...] "gold standard" [...] for determining toxin <b>type</b> is <b>a</b> mouse bioassay, but the genes for <b>types</b> <b>A,</b> B, E, and F can now be readily differentiated using quantitative PCR.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] 1. The {{phosphoglycerate kinase}} electrophoretic banding {{patterns}} of several Drosophila species were studied. 2. Three banding <b>types</b> were noted: <b>A</b> <b>type</b> with <b>a</b> slowly migrating band of activity, <b>a</b> <b>type</b> with <b>a</b> faster migrating band of activity, and <b>a</b> <b>type</b> with <b>an</b> intermediate migrating band. 3. These banding types {{appeared to be}} species specific and {{may be useful in}} evolutionary or tax-onomical studies...|$|R

5|$|According to the parataxonomic {{system used}} to {{classify}} fossil eggs, Gobioolithus is {{classified in the}} oofamily Gobioolithidae, which, in turn, is classified in the prismatic morphotype (also called the neognath morphotype) of the ornithoid basic <b>type.</b> <b>A</b> cladistic analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, they considered Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider <b>type,</b> <b>a</b> single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|BINA Istra, {{the primary}} {{operator}} of the route, leases the <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> B, and C service areas to various operators through public tenders. As of September 2011, INA was the rest-area operator on the A8 and the A9 motorways. The service area operators {{are not permitted}} to sublease the fuel operations, but can sublease other parts of the service areas. The A8's service areas are accessible {{from both sides of the}} motorway and operate 24hours a day, 7days a week.|$|E
50|$|In <b>type</b> theory, <b>a</b> <b>type</b> rule is <b>an</b> {{inference}} rule that describes how <b>a</b> <b>type</b> system assigns <b>a</b> <b>type</b> to <b>a</b> syntactic construction. These rules may be applied by the type system {{to determine if}} a program is well typed and what <b>type</b> expressions have. <b>A</b> prototypical example of the use of type rules is in defining type inference in the simply typed lambda calculus, which is the internal language of Cartesian closed categories.|$|R

5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation <b>type.</b> <b>A</b> single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this <b>type,</b> <b>a</b> total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E
5|$|British Airways is {{the largest}} airline based in the United Kingdom in terms of fleet size, {{international}} flights, and international destinations and was, until 2008, the largest airline by passenger numbers. The airline carried 34.6million passengers in 2008, but, rival carrier easyJet transported 44.5million passengers that year, passing British Airways for the first time. British Airways holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority <b>Type</b> <b>A</b> Operating Licence, it is permitted to carry passengers, cargo, and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>a</b> <b>type</b> {{class is}} <b>a</b> <b>type</b> system construct that supports ad hoc polymorphism.

5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 2.1 {{was officially}} {{announced}} by HDMI Forum on January 4, 2017. It was originally {{scheduled for release}} in Q2 2017 before being delayed to December of the same year. HDMI 2.1 added support for Dynamic HDR which is dynamic metadata that allows for changes on a scene-by-scene or frame-by-frame basis. It will also support higher resolutions and higher refresh rates which includes 4K/120 Hz and 8K/120 Hz. HDMI 2.1 specified a new 48G cable which supports a bandwidth of 48 Gbit/s and it uses HDMI <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> C and D connectors.|$|E
5|$|Imperfections in {{the crystal}} lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond {{may be the}} result of lattice {{irregularities}} or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which <b>type</b> <b>a</b> diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and {{questions about whether the}} Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had. The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding and a lack of care shown towards breeding stock selection. Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in Saint-Maixent and La Roche-sur-Yon, created the Anglo-Poitevin <b>type,</b> <b>a</b> half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed. Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed studbook.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} {{boundary}} with Ophiuchus are Zeta, Nu, and Omicron Serpentis. All three are 4th-magnitude main-sequence stars, with Nu and Omicron being of spectral <b>type</b> <b>A</b> and Zeta being of spectral type F. Nu {{is a single}} star with a 9th-magnitude visual companion, while Omicron is a Delta Scuti variable with amplitude variations of 0.01 magnitudes. In 1909, the symbiotic nova RT Serpentis appeared near Omicron, although it only reached a maximum magnitude of 10.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral <b>type</b> <b>A</b> {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
