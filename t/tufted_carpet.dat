2500|$|Although {{claimed by}} many cultures, this square <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet,</b> almost {{perfectly}} intact, {{is considered by}} many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is weaved using the Armenian double knot, and the red filaments color was made from Armenian cochineal. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, [...] "From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship".

2500|$|The {{historian}} Herodotus {{writing in}} the 5th century BC also informs us that {{the inhabitants of the}} Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade. Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The oldest, single, surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.

50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet</b> is {{the most}} common {{manufacturing}} technique. It implies poking yarn tufts in a textile support close to a sewing machine.

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. <b>Tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". <b>Tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R
25|$|The first census, {{conducted}} in 1801, states that Durham City had {{a population of}} 7,100. The Industrial Revolution mostly passed the city by. However, the city was well known for carpet making and weaving.

50|$|Artificial grass {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to natural grass for football stadia. There has been considerable development {{of this type of}} surface from the early days, when it was similar to <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet.</b> The performance of this surface has generally been questioned as not being truly natural. However, there are definite advantages with artificial grass, particularly when a stadium has heavy or multi-use requirements. Artificial grass also has an advantage in environments hostile to natural grass, for instance, low sunlight or a paucity of water.|$|E

5000|$|Product dyeing, {{also known}} as garment dyeing, {{is the process of}} dyeing {{products}} such as hosiery, sweaters, and carpet after they have been produced. This stage of dyeing is suitable when all components dye the same shade (including threads). This method is used to dye sheer hosiery since it is knitted using tubular knitting machines and then stitched prior to dyeing. <b>Tufted</b> <b>carpets,</b> with the exception of carpets produced using solution dyed fibers, are often dyed after they have been tufted. This method is not suitable for apparel with many components such as lining, zippers, and sewing thread, as each component may dye differently. The exception is tinting jeans with pigments for a “vintage” look. In tinting, color is used, whereas in other treatments such as acid-wash and stone-wash, chemical or mechanical processes are used. After garment construction, these products are given the [...] "faded" [...] or [...] "used" [...] look by finishing methods as opposed to dyeing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{preview of}} the final {{appearance}} of <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet,</b> this paper devises a solution to simulate the color appearance of <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet.</b> The simulation adopts color blocks to represent a single loop pile in carpet surface, through resizing color block size to simulate the extrusion between loop piles. The solution starts from traversing the control pattern to get the pile height level information. Base on the current and surrounded loop piles height level to infer the size and start point of color block for current loop pile. According to patterns ’ information to generate the color appearance simulation for loop pile <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet.</b> Base on the proposed simulation, devise the frame work and control logic for simulation software, and developed the simulation software with C++.

40|$|London-based artist David Mabb’s {{project has}} evolved out of several months spent researching Lithuanian applied arts {{production}} during the Soviet period {{known as the}} ‘Kruschev Thaw’. At that time protocols were developed to place artists/master craftsman in charge of industrial production of ceramics, glass, stained glass, textiles, and carpets — an initiative called ‘art into everyday life’ — that extended through to the 1970 s and the ‘Brezhnev Stagnation’. It was a period that also produced a number of elegant modernist buildings. After independence this history and the objects/buildings have been devalued because of their Soviet associations.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} was to to {{quantify}} the arising amount of production waste in carpet production especially in the dominating tufting technology in Germany and to line out the state of technology and research activities {{in the field of}} recycling of used carpet Materials. In 1994 about 170 Mill. sq m of <b>tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> have been produced in Germany. The corresponding volume of wastes was about 22. 000 metric tons. At end use level about 330 Mill. sq m have been sold in Germany. This is a volume near by 500. 000 metric tons per year which has to be handled as wastes after approximately 10 years of use. The report provides also information {{on the state of the}} art in recycling of carpet material and on research activities at European level. One of this project is RECAM (Recovery of Carpet Materials) and another project in EUREKA (European Recycling of Carpets) which deals also with collecting systems for used carpets as well as with recycling techniques.
