40|$|Background: <b>Tenecteplase</b> is a {{modified}} {{tissue plasminogen activator}} with a longer half-life and higher fibrin specificity than alteplase. Methods: We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized, pilot study of 0. 1 mg/kg IV <b>tenecteplase</b> given 3 to 6 hours after ischemic stroke onset. For a control group, we used patients contemporaneously treated with sub– 3 -hour 0. 9 mg/kg IV alteplase following standard selection criteria. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24 -hour perfusion/angiographic imaging with CT or MRI. Eligibility criteria for <b>tenecteplase</b> (but not alteplase) treatment included a perfusion lesion at least 20 % greater than the infarct core, with an associated vessel occlusion. Primary outcomes, assessed blind to treatment group, were reperfusion (reduction in baseline– 24 -hour mean transit time lesion) and major vessel recanalization. Results: Fifteen patients received <b>tenecteplase,</b> and 35 patients received alteplase. The <b>tenecteplase</b> group had greater reperfusion (mean 74 % vs 44 % in the alteplase group, p = 0. 01) and major vessel recanalization (10 / 15 <b>tenecteplase</b> vs 7 / 29 alteplase, p = 0. 01). Despite later time to treatment, more <b>tenecteplase</b> patients (10 / 15 vs 7 / 35 alteplase, p = 0. 001) had major neurologic improvement at 24 hours (NIH Stroke Scale reduction ≥ 8).

A total of 103 patients received intravenous bolus doses of 30, 40, or 50 mg <b>tenecteplase,</b> and 56 patients received 100 mg rt-PA as the accelerated 90 -minute infusion regimen in this randomized, open-label study. <b>Tenecteplase</b> and r-tPA plasma concentrations were measured for 6 hours. <b>Tenecteplase</b> exhibited biphasic elimination from the plasma with a mean initial half-life of 22 minutes and a mean terminal half-life of 115 minutes. The mean plasma clearance was 105 mL/min and did not depend on <b>tenecteplase</b> dose over the dose range studied. In comparison, rt-PA has a fourfold faster plasma clearance. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation showed that a dose of approximately 0. 5 mg/kg results in a plasma AUC value that provides a TIMI 3 flow at 90 minutes that is comparable to that reported with accelerated r-tPA.

BackgroundCombination therapy with reduced-dose fibrinolytics and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction improves biomarkers of reperfusion success but has not reduced mortality when compared with full-dose fibrinolytics. MethodsWe evaluated 140 patients enrolled in the INTEGRITI trial with 24 -h continuous 12 -lead ST-segment monitoring and angiography at 60 min. The dose-combination regimen of 50 % of standard-dose <b>tenecteplase</b> (0. 27 μg/kg) plus high-dose eptifibatide (2 boluses of 180 μg/kg separated by 10 min, 2. 0 μg/kg/min infusion) was compared with full-dose <b>tenecteplase</b> (0. 53 μg/kg). ResultsThe dose-confirmation regimen of reduced-dose <b>tenecteplase</b> plus high-dose eptifibatide was associated with a faster median time to stable ST-segment recovery (55 vs. 98 min, p = 0. 06), improved stable ST-segment recovery by 2 h (89. 6 % vs. 67. 7 %, p = 0. 02), and less recurrent ischemia (34. 0 % vs. 57. 1 %, p = 0. 05) when compared with full-dose <b>tenecteplase.</b> Continuously updated ST-segment recovery analyses demonstrated a modest trend toward greater ST-segment recovery at 30 min (57. 7 % vs. 40. 6 %, p = 0. 13) and 60 min (82. 7 % vs. 65. 6 %, p = 0. 08) with this regimen.

40|$|Abstract The {{administration}} of thrombolytic drugs is of proven benefit {{in a variety}} of clinical conditions requiring acute revascularization, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, and venous thrombosis. Generated plasmin can degrade non-target proteins, including apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein constituent of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the extent of apoA-I proteolytic degradation in AMI patients treated with two thrombolytic drugs, alteplase and the genetically engineered t-PA variant <b>tenecteplase.</b> ApoA-I degradation was evaluated in sera from 38 AMI patients treated with alteplase or <b>tenecteplase.</b> In vitro, apoA-I degradation was tested by incubating control sera or purified HDL with alteplase or <b>tenecteplase</b> at different concentrations (5 - 100 μg/ml). Treatment with alteplase and <b>tenecteplase</b> results in apoA-I proteolysis; the extent of apoA-I degradation was more pronounced in alteplase-treated patients than in tenecteplase-treated patients. In vitro, the extent of apoA-I proteolysis was higher in alteplase-treated sera than in tenecteplase-treated sera, in the whole drug concentration range. No direct effect of the two thrombolytic agents on apoA-I degradation was observed. In addition to apoA-I, apoA-IV was also degraded by the two thrombolytic agents and again proteolytic degradation was higher with alteplase than <b>tenecteplase.</b> In conclusion, this study indicates that both alteplase and <b>tenecteplase</b> cause plasmin-mediated proteolysis of apoA-I, with alteplase resulting in a greater apoA-I degradation than <b>tenecteplase,</b> potentially causing a transient impairment of HDL atheroprotective functions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{combination}} of older reduced-dose fibrinolytic agents and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors has shown modest improvements in reperfusion and more striking improvements in ST-segment resolution after acute myocardial infarction. We performed a multicenter dose-ranging study of reduced doses of a newer fibrinolytic (<b>tenecteplase)</b> combined with tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. METHODS: The first {{goal of the}} trial was to identify a dose or doses of tirofiban that, when combined with reduced-dose <b>tenecteplase,</b> {{would result in a}} higher incidence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 60 minutes versus full-dose <b>tenecteplase</b> alone. The second goal was to assess whether the optimum dose(s) from the first stage also would result in greater resolution of ST-segment elevation. RESULTS: In all, 409 patients aged 18 to 75 years with myocardial infarction were enrolled. The incidence of TIMI grade 3 flow at 60 minutes did not differ significantly among dose groups, ranging from 50 % to 68 %. The corrected TIMI frame count likewise did not differ substantially (range 34 - 42). More patients given combined therapy had complete resolution of ST-segment elevation at 60 minutes compared with patients given <b>tenecteplase</b> alone. Major bleeding was infrequent, and no strokes occurred. Based on angiographic results of the first stage, the second planned stage of the study was not performed. CONCLUSIONS: Although combination therapies were not associated with increased reperfusion compared with full-dose <b>tenecteplase</b> alone, similar TIMI flow grades were achieved despite reductions in <b>tenecteplase</b> doses.

Methods: Multicenter randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Eligible patients were ambulatory at baseline, had image-proven acute PE, a systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg and RV dysfunction (abnormal echocardiography, troponin or brain natriuretic peptide). Patients received anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and either tiered-dose <b>tenecteplase</b> or saline in an opaque syringe. Composite favorable outcome: 5 day survival to hospital discharge without shock, intubation, or major hemorrhage (any intracranial bleed or need for surgical or medical intervention for acute anemia), and at 90 days, normal RV on resting echocardiography, 6 minute walk distance> 330 m, no dyspnea at rest, and no recurrent PE or DVT. Self-perception of wellness was assessed by the SF- 16, VEINES-QOL and rank on 1 - 10 ordinal scale. Results: 83 patients were enrolled, including 33 women, 52 Caucasians, mean age 55 +/- 14 years, 43 received placebo, 40 received <b>tenecteplase,</b> and 38 had concomittant DVT.

Haemorrhagic complications of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are well known. Compared to other tPAs, <b>tenecteplase</b> use leads to lower rates of bleeding complications. Here, we report a case of unusual site of spontaneous bleeding, intralingual haematoma during <b>tenecteplase</b> therapy following acute myocardial infarction, which caused significant upper airway obstruction and required tracheotomy to maintain the patient’s airway. Clinical dilemmas related to securing the airway or reversing the effects of tissue plasminogen activator are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Background: We pooled 2 {{clinical}} trials of <b>tenecteplase</b> compared with alteplase {{for the treatment}} of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of <b>tenecteplase</b> and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with <b>tenecteplase</b> would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging. Methods: We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24 -hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds ratio of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds ratios. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume > 15 mL, mismatch ratio > 1. 8, baseline ischemic core < 70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue < 100 mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were analyzed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group. Results: Of 146 pooled patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received <b>tenecteplase.</b> Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: <b>tenecteplase,</b> 7; alteplase, 2; P= 0. 018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; P= 0. 02).

40|$|Background and Purpose—We {{compared}} the fibrinolytic activity of <b>tenecteplase</b> and alteplase {{in patients with}} acute ischemic stroke, and explored the association between hypofibrinogenaemia and intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods—Venous blood samples from a subgroup {{of participants in the}} Alteplase–Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis (ATTEST) study were obtained at pretreatment, 3 to 12 hours, and 24 ± 3 hours post-intravenous thrombolysis for analyses of plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, D-dimer, factor V, fibrinogen, and fibrin(ogen) degradation products, in addition to routine coagulation assays. Related sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test the within-group changes, and independent Mann–Whitney tests for between-group differences. Results—Thirty patients were included (alteplase= 14 and tenecteplase= 16) with similar baseline demographics. Compared with baseline, alteplase caused significant hypofibrinogenaemia (P= 0. 002), prolonged prothrombin time (P= 0. 011), hypoplasminogenaemia (P= 0. 001), and lower factor V (P= 0. 002) at 3 to 12 hours after administration with persistent hypofibrinogenaemia at 24 hours (P= 0. 011), whereas only minor hypoplasminogenaemia (P= 0. 029) was seen in the <b>tenecteplase</b> group. <b>Tenecteplase</b> consumed less plasminogen (P< 0. 001) and fibrinogen (P= 0. 002) compared with alteplase. Conclusions—In patients with acute ischemic stroke, alteplase 0. 9 mg/kg caused significant disruption of the fibrinolytic system, whereas <b>tenecteplase</b> 0. 25 mg/kg did not, consistent with the trend toward lower intracerebral hemorrhage incidence with <b>tenecteplase</b> in the ATTEST study...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) can diminish patient {{quality of life}} (QoL). The objective was to test whether treatment with <b>tenecteplase</b> has an independent effect on a measurement that reflects QoL in patients with submassive PE. This was a secondary analysis of an 8 -center, prospective randomized controlled trial, utilizing multivariate regression to control for predefined predictors of worsened QoL including: age, active malignancy, history of PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT), recurrent PE or DVT, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and heart failure. QoL was measured with the physical component summary (PCS) of the SF- 36. Analysis included 76 patients (37 randomized to <b>tenecteplase,</b> 39 to placebo). Multivariate regression yielded an equation f(8, 67), P< 0. 001, with R 2 = 0. 303. Obesity had the largest effect on PCS (β = − 8. 6, P< 0. 001), with <b>tenecteplase</b> second (β = 4. 73, P = 0. 056). After controlling for all interactions, <b>tenecteplase</b> increased the PCS by + 5. 37 points (P = 0. 027). In patients without any of the defined comorbidities, the coefficient on the <b>tenecteplase</b> variable was not significant (− 0. 835, P = 0. 777). In patients with submassive PE, obesity had the greatest influence on QoL, followed by use of fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis had a marginal independent effect on patient QoL after controlling for comorbidities, but was not significant in patients without comorbid conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{bioengineered}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator <b>tenecteplase</b> is an important treatment modality of acute myocardial infarction recommended by international guidelines. Following introduction of originator <b>tenecteplase</b> (brand names Metalyse® and TNKase®), a ‘biosimilar’ <b>tenecteplase</b> became available for commercial use in India under the brand name Elaxim® {{in the absence of}} Indian biosimilar guidelines which came into force from September 15 th, 2012. Based on a report of biochemical and fibrinolytical differences between Metalyse and Elaxim, we have systematically compared them in a range of routine quality testing assays. As compared to Metalyse, Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity and contained less of the two-chain form of <b>tenecteplase.</b> Even upon full in vitro conversion to the two-chain form Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity. This was linked to differences in sialic acid content and glycosylation pattern with Elaxim exhibiting less bi- and more tetra-antennary glycosylation, leading to different charge heterogeneity profile. Regarding purity, Elaxim contained more <b>tenecteplase</b> aggregates and, in contrast to Metalyse, considerable amounts of Chinese hamster ovary cell protein. Taken together these data demonstrate that Metalyse and Elaxim differ considerably in clot lysis activity and biochemical properties. These data question whether Elaxim indeed can be considered a ‘biosimilar’ of Metalyse, i. e. whether and to which extent the clinical efficacy and safety properties of Metalyse can be extrapolated to Elaxim in the absence of comparative clinical data...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionTenecteplase {{can be a}} more {{effective}} and convenient alternative in treatment of prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT). CaseWe hereby present {{a case of the}} use of <b>Tenecteplase</b> for recurrence of mitral valve thrombosis in a patient who was brought as an emergency with breathing difficulty at rest. A single intravenous bolus of <b>Tenecteplase</b> relieved her symptoms dramatically within a few hours. This is in contradistinction to her earlier similar presentation with valve thrombosis a year back, when both streptokinase and urokinase had not worked. ConclusionThe use of <b>Tenecteplase</b> in PVT is reasonable, but needs more documentation. The therapeutic response was remarkable in our case. It is also better suited for recurrence of valve thrombosis as streptokinase cannot be used for a second time...|$|E
