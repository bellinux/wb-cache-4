5000|$|In her {{review of}} Sociological Images, Karen McCormack {{identifies}} four different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> throughout the blog: visual plus, text plus, open post, and data display. In the visual plus posts, the images dominate and little text {{is needed to}} explain {{the point of the}} post. For example, she highlights a post from 14 January 2011, [...] "Glamorizing Brutality toward Women", that juxtaposes a series of images and videos [...] "to expose the acceptability of violence against women" [...] and how [...] "the more mundane images of violence are consistent with the more grotesque and disturbing". These kinds of posts are often filled with historical images [...] "to highlight continuity or change over time", such as the ways in which different racial groups have been dehumanized through animal-like caricature. These historical trends {{are some of the most}} highlighted and praised posts by reviewers. For example, one interviewer praised The White Woman's Burden, which demonstrated the consistent colonial impulse in advertising. Text plus posts use visuals to augment the words; the majority of these posts make readers aware of sociological arguments in other fora, such as TED talks or New York Times editorials. They summarize and link to these longer form arguments. Open posts [...] "treat the images and videos as polysemic - open to multiple and contradictory interpretations from the audience". These are [...] "less analytic and more provocative", prompting readers to ask and answer questions. For example, in a post about color photos from the Great Depression, images dominate and the post ends with a question: [...] "are we more able to relate to the people in the photographs because they are in colour? Do we experience less distance between their lives and our own because the medium is both more familiar and closer to what we see?" [...] Data display posts visualize complex data so that readers can understand difficult issues in new ways; they also link readers to sites with interactive mapping tools and other kinds of software that enable them to make their own projects. McCormack points to one particularly good example of this kind of post, a video of Hans Rosling explaining the relationship between wealth and life expectancy throughout the world over the past 200 years.|$|E

Methods: Five <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> and cores (Cerapost with Empress cosmo, Cerapost with composite resin, gilded Ni-Cr alloy, gold alloy and Ni-Cr alloy) were made. The shifts in color of three points of IPS-Empress 2 crown surface (cervical, middle and incisal) with different posts and cores was measured with a spectroradiometer (PR- 650). Results: The L* a* b* values of zirconium oxide and gilded Ni- Cr alloy posts and cores with ceramic crown were the highest. The L* a* values of zirconium oxide posts composite cores were higher while the b* values were lower. The L* a* b* values of Ni-Cr alloy were {{lower than that of}} gold alloy and were the lowest. Conclusion: In combination with IPS- Empress 2 crown, zirconium oxide posts are suitable for routine use in the anterior dentition, and gilded Ni- Cr alloy and gold alloy posts and cores can be recommended for clinical practice.

Television shows are among those brands using Facebook as a platform to connect with consumers, and their potential for fan relationships is unique from those of other brands, but there are, as of yet, no published scholarly articles for driving Facebook fan engagement and loyalty for a television show.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{influence}} of different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> and cores on light transmission through all-ceramic crowns {{was assessed by}} spectrophotometric analysis and clinical evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three extracted natural teeth were replicated in acrylic resin, with roots prepared to receive standardized posts and cores. Using a silicone impression material as a template, various prosthodontic reconstructions were obtained by combining four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> and cores (polished and matte-finished gold alloy, all-ceramic, and ceramized metal alloy) and three types of all-ceramic crowns (IPS-Empress 2 surface-colored, IPS-Empress 2 stratified, and In-Ceram). The spectrophotometric analysis was performed in the dark at 25 degrees C. The teeth were backlit with an incandescent lamp at the color temperature of A illuminant and shielded to avoid spurious light entering the spectrophotometer. The transmitted light was analyzed in terms of luminance at four points of the sample surface (cervical, middle, incisal, and proximal). Twelve measurements were performed for the natural teeth, and 144 were performed for the artificial teeth. RESULTS: Natural teeth had the highest luminance. Among all-ceramic crowns, surface-colored IPS-Empress 2 had the highest luminance, and stratified IPS-Empress 2 had the lowest. Regarding posts and cores, the luminance was highest with the all ceramic, lower with the ceramized and the polished gold alloy (which had very similar luminance), and lowest with the matte-finished gold alloy. No significant difference among prosthodontic combinations was detected under clinical observation. CONCLUSION: The surface-colored glass ceramic (IPS-Empress 2) was the most translucent crown. At the standard crown thickness used, there were small, significant spectrophotometric, but not clinical, differences among the combinations tested. These findings show no esthetic contraindications {{for the use of}} polished gold alloy posts and cores with all-ceramic crowns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the great}} amount of hard dental tissues loss, most of non-vital teeth must be prosthetically {{restored}} using a post. The anchorage of these posts is based on enlarging the root canal, {{so the question is}} what type of endodontic post is more appropriate to use in order to ensure a favorable prognosis of these teeth, avoiding as long as possible their extraction. Loss of teeth is affecting not only the oral cavity and the dento-maxillary system, but also {{the quality of life of}} the patients, with both psychological and general health consequences. Even treated, the edentulous state determines major changes in diet and can be a cause of gastrointestinal disorders.
