30|$|In this section, {{the models}} {{developed}} here (Equations 3 / 4 with appropriate parameters from Table  3) are {{compared to other}} published yield <b>tables.</b> <b>For</b> western hemlock, the comparison is made to yield tables published by Barnes (1962) and Taylor (1934). These <b>tables</b> are <b>for</b> fully stocked stands with a minimum diameter limit of 1.5  cm, making them approximately {{the same as the}} EP 703 hemlock plots.

Barnes (1962) published yield <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> Oregon/Washington, Alaska, and British Columbia; the British Columbia tables were used in this comparison. At the same starting conditions at age 20, both the Taylor and Barnes yield curves are approximately the same for site index 25 and 29 stands. The western hemlock model predicts greater yields than these two yield tables at site index 25 and 29, but at site index 29 the yields are similar below age 60. At site index 34, the yields from Equations 3 / 4 and from Barnes’ yield table are almost identical (Taylor did not publish yield <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> site indexes greater than 32).|$|R

40|$|AbstractMost steroidal ointments contain {{propylene}} glycol (PG) and surfactants, which improve the solubility of corticosteroids in white petrolatum. Surfactants aid the uniform dispersal of PG within white petrolatum. Since the surfactants used in generic ointments are usually {{different from those}} used in brand name ointments, we investigated the effects of surfactants on the rheological properties of three brand name ointments and six equivalent generic ointments. We detected marked differences in hardness, adhesiveness, and spreadability among the ointments. Further examinations of model ointments consisting of white petrolatum, PG, and surfactants revealed that the abovementioned properties, especially hardness and adhesiveness, were markedly affected by the surfactants. Since steroidal ointments are often admixed with moisturizing creams prior to use, we investigated the <b>mixing</b> <b>compatibility</b> of the ointments with heparinoid cream and how this was affected by their surfactants. We found that the ointments containing glyceryl monostearate demonstrated good <b>mixing</b> <b>compatibility,</b> whereas those containing non-ionic surfactants with polyoxyethylene chains exhibited phase separation. These results were also {{consistent with the findings}} for the model ointments, which indicates that the <b>mixing</b> <b>compatibility</b> of steroidal ointments with heparinoid cream is determined by the emulsifying capacity of the surfactants in their oily bases...|$|R

A key parameter in the tool {{is the degree to which}} average dining durations are inflated. The tool user selects this inflation factor according to expectations regarding the extent to which parties will exceed the anticipated average dining time. Lower inflation factors result in more revenue, because more reservations are accepted, but also come with lower service levels, meaning more customers will need to wait <b>for</b> a <b>table.</b> Based on the user inputs, the tool, which uses the Solver add-in for Microsoft Excel, returns the optimum <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> <b>for</b> the greatest revenue...|$|R

While eight of the restaurants had the actual optimum <b>table</b> <b>mix</b> <b>for</b> peak operating times, the other 60 restaurants were leaving some money on the table. That is, most restaurants could improve their table mix. On average, the restaurants in this sample could increase their peak revenue by almost 15 percent by implementing a more effective table mix.

30|$|Aerosol optical {{properties}} {{are a key}} determinant of their influence on the Earth’s radiation budget. We plan to follow standard methods employed in existing aerosol transport models (e.g., GOCART, SPRINTARS, ECHAM: Pozzoli et al. 2011; the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model HadGEM: Bellouin et al. 2011) to determine the aerosol {{optical properties}}. The single-scattering properties of spherical aerosol particles can be approximated using Mie scattering theory in radiative flux calculations. The wavelength of light, the radius of a particle, and the refractive index of its medium at the relevant wavelength are required to determine the extinction coefficient, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor. The effect of water uptake on hygroscopic aerosol particles is approximated by calculating the particle radius and refractive index {{for a series of}} relative humidity values; the refractive indices are calculated {{on the basis of the}} volume-weighted mixing assumption between water and dry components (e.g., Haywood et al. 1997; Takemura et al. 2002; Eq. 3). The internal mixture effect is also approximated using the volume-weighted <b>mixing</b> assumption <b>for</b> multiple different components. Non-spherical dust particles are approximated as their corresponding spherical particles in calculating their optical properties, because relative errors introduced by this assumption are very small (Fu et al. 2009). We will generate lookup tables of extinction coefficients, single-scattering albedos, and asymmetry factors computed using a Mie theory program for the discretized series of aerosol particle radii, relative humidity values, and band wavelengths as applicable to each aerosol type. An internal mixture will be assumed only for organic and black carbonaceous aerosol particles at this stage to avoid heavy computational loads by including all mixture combinations; lookup <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> the <b>mixed</b> particles will also be prepared.|$|R
