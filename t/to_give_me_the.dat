Though initially praising its visuals and setting, Mackey found the puzzles {{to be very difficult}} and [...] "there's simply too much going on <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> proper feedback about what I'm getting wrong", suggesting that [...] "Blow was maybe a little too close to his work".|$|E
500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? My mother... used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E

During the trial, Shepherd's neighbor Dionne Whitaker remembered the smell as being [...] "worse than {{the smell of}} singed hair or burning tires".

Quanell, who also testified as a witness, stated Shepherd told him, [...] "They're going to kill me, man. They're going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> death penalty."

2500|$|A {{native of}} Cluj (Kolozsvár) city in Transylvania, the future writer {{was born to}} ethnic Romanian parents: his father, Aurel Isac, was a lawyer, later noted for {{representing}} the Romanian civil disobedience Memorandum movement, after it was prosecuted by the Hungarian authorities; his mother, Elisabeta-Eliza née Roşescu, was a schoolteacher. As the poet later recalled in a tongue-in-cheek memoir of his childhood: [...] "I was born in Cluj, when the Someş was boiling with blood and my father reaped the flowers of pain [...] I came around when called upon by my mother—and the priest baptized me in Eau de Cologne, or blood, or tears, or holy water—and my godfather wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> name Alfred, for he loved Musset, but my father gave me the name , since he loved Rousseau." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Waits {{was extremely}} busy working on movie soundtracks, acting, {{and contributing to}} a number of music projects by other artists. First, Waits appeared on the Primus album Sailing the Seas of Cheese as the voice of [...] "Tommy the Cat", which exposed him to a new audience in alternative rock. This was the first of several collaborations between Waits and the group; Frontman Les Claypool would appear on several subsequent Waits releases. The same year saw Waits provide spoken word contributions to Devout Catalyst, an album by one of Waits' greatest influences, Ken Nordine, on the songs [...] "A Thousand Bing Bangs" [...] and [...] "The Movie." [...] Waits also contributed vocals to a duet with singer Bob Forrest on the song [...] "Adios Lounge" [...] on the Thelonious Monster album Beautiful Mess. He also contributed vocals to two songs ("Little Man" [...] and [...] "I'm Not Your Fool Anymore") on jazz tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards' album Mississippi Lad. Edwards was extremely complimentary of Waits' contributions, saying:Tom Waits is the one who got me my contract with PolyGram. He's wonderful, he's America's best lyricist since Johnny Mercer. He came down to the studio on the Mississippi Lad album, that's the first one I did for PolyGram, and he sang two of my songs, wouldn't accept any money, just trying <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> best boost that he could.|$|E
