5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and Quagmire are shown {{watching}} television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter {{then goes on to}} express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E
5|$|The story {{followed}} an unnamed warrior {{who became the}} player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E
25|$|The Albanian Urban Lyric Song is a {{tradition}} that started in Albania in the 18th century but culminated in the 1930s. These songs are {{a major part of}} Albania's music heritage, but have been little-studied by ethnomusicologists, who prefer to focus on the rural folk music <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as being more authentically Albanian.|$|E

25|$|All babies imitate {{with their}} hands the {{movements}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see.</b> Typical gestures for example are raising arms to be lifted up, or grabbing/reaching to indicate wanting a bottle; these are used referentially. In addition, infants who grow up with a sign language begin to make gestures that are distinct from all other hand movements and gestures.|$|E
25|$|Shareholders and investors, through {{socially}} responsible investing, {{are using their}} capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary. For example, some religious investors in the US have withdrawn investment from companies that violate their religious views, while secular investors divest from companies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as imposing religious views on workers or customers.|$|E
25|$|The {{adjective}} indigenous {{is derived}} from the Latin word indigena, which is based on the root gen- 'to be born' with an archaic form of the prefix in 'in'. Any given people, ethnic group or community may be described as indigenous in reference to some particular region or location <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as their traditional tribal land claim. Other terms used to refer to indigenous populations are aboriginal, native, original, or first (as in Canada's First Nations).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} steps, which is also controversial, is {{a new system of}} registrations, passports, and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims. This system is {{designed}} to encourage and accommodate first-time visitors to Mecca, while restricting repeat visits. Pilgrims who have the means and desire to perform the Hajj several times have protested what they see as discrimination, but the Hajj Commission has stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> no alternative if further tragedies are to be prevented.|$|E
25|$|Manual {{babbling}} is structurally {{identical to}} vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants {{who grow up}} with a sign language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, {{he or she will}} still imitate the signs <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, the Right {{had shifted}} {{to support the}} newly rich in some European {{countries}} (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing, such as Carlism in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, {{there are still a}} few right-wing movements today, notably the French Nouvelle Droite, CasaPound and American paleoconservatives, that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as essential for social order.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{destruction}} {{was caused}} to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure. According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. Of the three per cent of industrial capacity {{that was still}} operating after the 18-month Israeli blockade, much has now been destroyed. The biggest Palestinian food-processing plant, Alweyda was devastated, as were both Abu Eida, the largest ready-mixed concrete producer, with four factories demolished, and the Al Badr flour mills, with the biggest storage facilities in the Strip. All three had close and long-standing contact with Israeli partner firms and suppliers. The owners stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> this {{as part of an}} economic war to make Gaza dependent on Israel.|$|E

All of the matches thus made are highly and comically unsuitable; Constance, for example, loves the ancient notary who performed the betrothal ("Dear friends, take pity on my lot"). However, Alexis is pleased with the results, and now asserts that he and Aline should drink the potion themselves to seal their own love. Aline is hurt by his lack of trust and refuses, offending him ("Thou hast the power thy vaunted love"). Alexis is distracted, however, by the revelation of his upper-class father having fallen for the lower-class Mrs Partlet, but he determines to make the best of this union ("I rejoice that it's decided").|$|E

He rejects the view that the controversy arose from a misunderstanding of the story, writing that Indonesian Muslims reacted because they will not accept works <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> as denying the existence of Allah or comparing Pancasila to Nasakom. He notes that Jassin is inconsistent in his defense, calling the representations of Allah, Muhammad, and Gabriel figments of the author's imagination, but citing Sukarno and Nasakom as influences.|$|E

In the same month, Cruise suggested to his critics <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> the film before denouncing it. In October 2007, fellow Valkyrie actor Kenneth Branagh said that the issue had been [...] "largely exaggerated" [...] and that the German official who initially incited the complaints contacted the production one week into filming to apologise, after reading the script and realising he had misinterpreted the film's plot.|$|E

Curt and Steve are scheduled to travel the next morning to Northeastern United States to start college. Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local Moose Lodge, Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives Toad his 1958 Chevrolet Impala to watch while he's away at college until he returns at Christmas. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie, who is also Curt's sister, arrives in her car. Steve suggests to Laurie, who is already glum about him going to college, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> other people while he is away in order to [...] "strengthen" [...] their relationship.

500|$|Circe– A witch of {{the island}} of Aeaea in the graphic novel [...] Circe was {{recruited}} by the Redeemed Warrior (who becomes the player's multiplayer character in Ascension); she seemingly also wanted revenge against the general, who had killed the warrior's father. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. They eventually encounter the general, who was revealed to be the warrior's uncle and Circe's lover; Circe only aided the warrior so he would reach the general. Circe offered the warrior a choice; serve the general and his men would be spared, or kill the general and she would kill his men. The warrior then declared {{that he would not}} slay Circe and defended the lives of his men, but tricked the general into drinking from a cup that he had secretly filled with poisonous Cerberus blood, which killed the general. Circe was aghast at the warrior's vengeful act and retreated, never to be seen again.|$|E

In order to make everything right about the future, Peter and Brian decide to sneak into the prom through a vent. While inside it, Peter recites {{a line from the}} 1988 action film Die Hard. The sequence that follows is a parody of the 1985 film Back to the Future.
