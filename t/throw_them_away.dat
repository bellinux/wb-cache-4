5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>away</b> as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E
25|$|Amidst British {{concerns}} that France might collapse altogether, the sixth {{session of the}} Supreme War Council met on 1–3 June.

Haig did not side openly with him.|$|E

"Disregarding this, we {{say that}} the earth on all its sides is the same; all people on the earth stand upright, and all heavy things fall down to the earth by a law of nature, {{for it is the}} nature of the earth to attract and to keep things, as it is the nature of water to flow, that of fire to burn, and that of the wind to set in motion. If a thing wants to go deeper down than the earth, let it try. The earth is the only low thing, and seeds always return to it, in {{whatever}} direction you may <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>away,</b> and never rise upwards from the earth." ...|$|E
