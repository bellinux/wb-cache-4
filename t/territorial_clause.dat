25|$|This clause, {{commonly}} known as the Property or <b>Territorial</b> <b>Clause,</b> grants Congress the constitutional authority for the management and control of all territories or other property owned by United States. Additionally, the clause also proclaims that nothing contained within the Constitution may be interpreted to harm (prejudice) any claim of the United States, or of any particular State. The exact scope of this clause has long been a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, {{there was a}} {{significant}} movement in favor of this U.S. territory becoming a commonwealth, which would give it a level of self-government similar to Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. However, the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, because its clauses were incompatible with the <b>Territorial</b> <b>Clause</b> (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) of the U.S. Constitution. Other movements advocate U.S. statehood for Guam, union with the state of Hawaii, or union with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single territory, or independence.|$|E

The author notes that the Pyrenean range was the cradle of Catalonia, not a frontier, and gives an account of how the new delimitation was traced. She also discusses Catalan resistance along the border (in Rosselló). Reference is made to the on-going wars between France and Spain after 1659, to the ill-defined nature of the new border, and to France's offer to exchange Rosselló for the lands lying along its eastern frontier, in which it was primarily interested. This offer was never accepted. The dynastic, patrimonial and military origin and nature of European frontiers, which were established regardless of, and often in opposition to, the existence of peoples, is stressed...|$|R
25|$|Having been annexed from Spain in 1898, the unincorporated {{territory}} of Puerto Rico represented a paradox during the Cold War, politically {{belonging to the}} United States but culturally to Latin America. Its location in the Caribbean converted it in the American response to Cuba, directly affecting the development of its political status. Puerto Rico was allowed to enact a heavily revised local Constitution, but its attempts to employ its sovereignty {{and use it to}} remove the application of the <b>Territorial</b> <b>Clause</b> of the United States Constitution ended in failure. The United States military {{played a key role in}} perpetuating the status quo, not wanting to risk the possibility that a change in status could affect their presence in the Caribbean. A situation further complicated by the emergence of Marxist guerrillas, including the notorious Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña and Boricua Popular Army, within the pre-existing independence movement in Puerto Rico. Ultimately, the status issue stagnated throughout the remainder of the Cold War, but the pro-sovereignty efforts undertaken during this time frame eventually led to the current incarnation of the free association movement in Puerto Rico.|$|E
500|$|On November 26, 2004, Ojeda Ríos {{issued a}} post-election {{statement}} and after classifying {{the process as}} one that arises from [...] "illusions" [...] that promote [...] "division", diverted his attention {{to a series of}} editorials published by Claridad analyzing the political environment of Puerto Rico, in particular one published {{during the first week of}} November where the newspaper stated its availability to all sectors within the movement. He argued against the individualization of the independence movement, citing that years of epithets and personalisms in the independentist speech had not advanced the cause. To control any damage caused by these, Ojeda Ríos proposed that the debates between factions should be held in private, allowing a dispassionate and conciliatory approach to the solution of these problems. He clarified that the EPB did believe in organizing general elections, but only when [...] "regulated by strict democratic rules", which they don't perceive in the events held under the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause.</b> Ojeda Ríos also opposed participating in a democracy that supports military incursions in independent states. He proposed the [...] "harmonization" [...] of al sectors within the movement and requested that despite their own philosophical differences, other organizations should avoid trying to gain status by seeking to supplant the PIP.|$|E
500|$|In September 2004, {{while being}} interviewed about an {{anthology}} of the independence movement on radio Juan Mari Brás made a public request to Ojeda Ríos to detail the EPB's ideology for that project. The requested information was received shortly afterwards and published in Claridad. The article begins by quoting Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth [...] "the colonized are cured of colonial neurosis by driving the colonist out by force", citing the ambient of the populace after the destruction of airplanes in Muñiz airbase {{as an example of}} this, remembering a general feeling of [...] "pride and hope" [...] in the populace. Ojeda Ríos then establishes a dichotomy between the reactionary violence of colonialism and revolutionary actions, saying that the first was imposed on Puerto Ricans and created divisions that could potentially lead to a Civil War. He then discussed that the EPB believes that the right for self-determination and independence established in Resolution 1514 (XV) grants [...] "moral and legal strength" [...] to their actions. Ojeda Ríos further cites the provisions of Resolution 2105 (XX) inviting UN members to cooperate with armed resistance in colonies, the assessment provided in Resolution 2326 that repression of armed movements is [...] "incompatible with the parameters of Resolution 1514" [...] and Resolution 2621 (XXV) that declares ongoing colonialism a crime [...] "against the principles of international law" [...] as supporting his stance. He concludes by stating that the violence employed by the EPB [...] "is not aggressive, but defensive". Ojeda Ríos also quoted Fanon's assertion that the [...] "colonist makes history", noting the existence of two coexisting and conflicting accounts of Puerto Rican history and establishing a parallel with the revolutionary history in the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean in particular by mentioning the involvement of Antonio Valero de Bernabé and María Mercedes in Simon Bolivar's campaign. He cites the 1811 San Germán conspiracy, an independentist uprising planned by members of the Regimiento de Granada Andrés Salvador and Juan Vizcarrondo Ortiz de Zárate in 1838 and the actions of bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi and politician Ramón Power y Giralt as events that build the Cry of Lares and as part of an [...] "ignored history". Ojeda also established a contrast between Betances and Luis Muñoz Rivera, calling the latter an [...] "opportunist" [...] that promoted a reform of the Spanish colonial system, calling Albizu the spiritual successor of the former for his criticism of autonomists that pursue an expansion of faculties under the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause.</b> He calls Corretjer the next link in the chain and laments that the initiatives of independentists that were part of the Muñoz Marín administration were attributed to the governor [...] "for the benefit of the North American government". Ojeda Ríos reiterated his posture against participating in general elections and rebutted an argument recently published where countries like Mexico, Brasil, Argentina and Chile were essentially neocolonies, citing that they merely responded to their historical realities and were still capable to employ these alliances according to their own interests despite the influence of the United States. Ojeda Ríos concluded noting that EPB members held civilian jobs and acted covertly, resulting in the presence of Macheteros in any place and any government agency, noting that at the moment their strategy was not one of frontal assault but of armed propaganda, through which actions were focused on targets that could gather the attention and support of the public. He insisted that this was resulting in a covert support that would allow a progression towards other strategies, while avoiding actions against them. Ojeda Ríos closed this letter by contrasting the actions of the EPB to terrorist tactics, citing the ongoing war in the Middle East, the Holocaust and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as examples of an unacceptable terrorism that had [...] "no space" [...] within the organization's philosophy. One that he described as based on the principles of [...] "equality" [...] and [...] "social justice".|$|E

"In {{a violent}} {{personal}} interview which Spanish {{minister to the}} U.S., Marqués de Casa Yrujo held with him, Madison speedily learned that Spain would by no means consent to this interpretation.

500|$|New York went 8–4–1 in 1926, and {{withstood}} {{a challenge}} from an upstart American football league {{led by a}} team featuring Grange. Grange and his agent had formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. Grange's agent, C.C. Pyle, had {{tried to get the}} franchise admitted into the NFL using Yankee Stadium but was blocked by Mara, who asserted his <b>territorial</b> rights <b>clause.</b> Angered, Pyle swore revenge, saying [...] "I am now ready to put the National Football League, and Mr. Mara out of business." [...] According to a story published by The New York Times in December 1926, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL.

2500|$|On March 16, 2011, the President's Task Force {{released}} their report, {{joining the}} others in stating that Puerto Rico remains under the Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that any attempt to pursue an enhanced Commonwealth within the <b>Territorial</b> <b>Clause</b> would be [...] "constitutionally problematic" [...] and not permanent, but mechanism proposed by the document was {{not supported by the}} sovereigntists, who felt that it placed the options in arbitrary classifications and kept the territorial Commonwealth as a viable option.|$|E
2500|$|It also {{establishes}} extradition {{between the}} states, {{as well as}} laying down a legal basis for freedom of movement and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, but {{in the days of}} the Articles of Confederation, crossing state lines was often arduous and costly. The <b>Territorial</b> <b>Clause</b> gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States.

2500|$|A {{major issue}} {{early in the}} 20th century was whether the whole Constitution applied to the territories called insular areas by Congress. [...] In a series of {{opinions}} by the Supreme Court of the United States, {{referred to as the}} Insular Cases, the Court ruled that territories belonged to, but were not part of the United States. Therefore, under the <b>Territorial</b> <b>clause</b> Congress had the power to determine which parts of the Constitution applied to the territories. [...] These rulings have helped shape public opinion among Puerto Ricans during the ongoing debate over the commonwealth's political status.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{alternative}} French {{policy was}} {{to seek a}} rapprochement with Germany. In May 1919 the diplomat René Massigli was sent on several secret missions to Berlin. During his visits Massigli offered {{on behalf of his}} government to revise the <b>territorial</b> and economic <b>clauses</b> of the upcoming peace treaty. Massigli spoke of the desirability of [...] "practical, verbal discussions" [...] between French and German officials that would lead to a [...] "collaboration Franco-allemande". Furthermore, Massagli told the Germans that the French thought of the [...] "Anglo-Saxon powers", namely the United States and British Empire, to be the major threat to France in the post-war world. He argued that both France and Germany had a joint interest in opposing [...] "Anglo-Saxon domination" [...] of the world and warned that the [...] "deepening of opposition" [...] between the French and the Germans [...] "would lead to the ruin of both countries, to the advantage of the Anglo-Saxon powers".|$|R
5000|$|The {{son of a}} Protestant law professor, Massigli {{was born}} in Montpellier in the {{southern}} French department of Hérault. He joined the French foreign service during the First World War. During World War I, Massigli served in the Maison de la Presse section of the Quai d'Orsay in Bern, Switzerland, where he analysed German newspapers for the French government. In the spring of 1919, Massigli was sent on several unofficial missions to Berlin to contact German officials about {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Versailles. In May 1919, Massagli had a series of secret meetings with various German officials in which he offered on behalf of his government to revise the peace terms of the upcoming Treaty of Versailles in Germany's favour in regards to <b>territorial</b> and economic <b>clauses</b> of the proposed treaty. Massigli suggested [...] "practical, verbal discussions" [...] between French and German officials in the hope of creating [...] "collaboration franco-allemande". During his meetings, Massigli let the Germans know of the deep divisions between the [...] "Big Three" [...] at the Paris Peace Conference, namely Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau. Speaking on behalf of the French government, Massilgi informed the Germans that the French considered the [...] "Anglo-Saxon powers", namely the United States and the British Empire to be the real post-war threat to France, argued that both France and Germany had a common interest in opposing [...] "Anglo-Saxon domination" [...] of the world and warned that the [...] "deepening of opposition" [...] between the French and the Germans [...] "would lead to the ruin of both countries, to the advantage of the Anglo-Saxon powers". The French overtures to the Germans was rejected by the latter because the Germans regarded the French offers to be a trap to trick them into accepting the Versailles treaty [...] "as is" [...] and because the German foreign minister, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau thought that the United States was more likely to soften the peace terms then France.|$|R
2500|$|At the 2012 General Elections García Padilla became {{governor}} {{while the}} majority of soberanistas were re-elected as mayors and additional sympathizers joined the incumbents in [...] the legislature.

2500|$|... {{against the}} pro-sovereignty postures of the {{previous}} administration, being led by senator Alejandro García Padilla, Roberto Pratts and a now-conservative Jorge Colberg. This move was sorely received by the liberal faction, which noted that representatives Carmen Yulín Cruz, Charlie Hernández, Luis Vega Ramos and Luis Raúl Torres, as well as senators Antonio Fas Alzamora and Cirilo Tirado were directly elected, while conservatives such as Colberg Toro entered {{as a product of}} the Minority Law. Within the PPD this conflict was met with a variety of reactions, most notably the forma division of estadolibrismo in two well-defined factions, soberanistas that support sovereignty and autonomistas that support more autonomy inside the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause.</b> Led by an increasingly vocal Miranda Marín, soberanistas gained a foothold in the Mayor's Association. Hernández Mayoral emerged as the conservative's public speaker, to the point of promoting that the soberanistas were expelled from the party.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{noting the}} {{perception}} that the status debate was not advancing within the PPD, he proposed {{the creation of a new}} party, Partido por la Libre Asociación (lit. [...] "Party for Free Association"), to directly promote free association. The initiative turned into the Partido Acción Civil (lit. [...] "Civil Action Party"), which dropped the status from its platform, aborting the initiative. Ricardo Alegría, a fervent supporter of independence and culture, noted that he would be willing to temporarily support free association in this meant abolishing the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause.</b> Juan Mari Brás, expressed a similar position, claiming that while it is not independence, free association is flexible and [...] "is not a one way street like statehood". In 2002, Julio Muriente of the Movimiento Independentista Nacional Hostosiano (MINH) a moderate pro-independence group, argued that if the free association movement gained prominence within the PPD, it was only a matter of time until the inmovilism surrounding the status debate was vanquished.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leadership}} of the MUS prefers to avoid the term ELA Soberano, instead simply referring to it as free association, claiming {{that it could be}} misinterpreted as a form of [...] "enhanced" [...] territorial Commonwealth. However, on September 12, 2013, the institution published a note stating that it would be willing to cooperate in an ELA Soberano proposal as long as it meets with a series of requirements. The first being that it should be compliant with Principle VI of the UN's 1541 Resolution and be product of a process of self-determination. The MUS also demands that Public Law 81-600, known as the Federal Relations Law and which keeps Puerto Rico subjected to the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause,</b> be abolished as part of the proposal stripping and retaining the sovereignty of Puerto Rico from the Congress of the United States. In a departure from the PPD's posture, the MUS seeks that the compact of association can be modified or concluded unilaterally as long as the decision is ratified by popular vote.|$|E
2500|$|On October 4, 2011, Fortuño {{announced}} that his administration would hold a local status referendum after H.R. 2499 failed to {{advance in the}} US Senate. In the project proposed and later approved, voters {{were going to be}} asked two questions: (1) whether they agreed to continue with Puerto Rico's territorial status and -if not- (2) to indicate the political status they preferred from three possibilities: [...] "Statehood", [...] "Independence" [...] or a [...] "Sovereign Associated Free State". The referendum was set for November 6, 2012, the same day of the general elections. In February [...] 2012, the government board led by García Padilla announced the strategy of the conservative leadership to participate in the referendum, to vote [...] "Yes" [...] to continuing under the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause</b> and to not vote for any of the non-territorial options listed in the second question. However, the soberanistas countered by openly promoting a vote for the [...] "Sovereign Free Association" [...] option, while adhering to the leadership's mandate to vote [...] "Yes" [...] in the first question. However, García Padilla temporarily suspended Rep. Charlie Hernández when the {{announced that}} he would also vote for the [...] "No" [...] option was made.|$|E
2500|$|The Estado Libre Asociado as {{conceived}} by Fernós {{was focused on}} the internationalization of Puerto Rico rather that its growth within the limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United States, as exposed in an article published by him on July 2, 1946, where he discussed the type of relation that should be established {{with the rest of the}} world. The most notable example is his argument that the economy needed to evolve from the bilateral terms of the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause</b> to a multilateral model that allowed for better trade options. Fernós also supported the conservation of the economic aspects of the Foraker Law that would benefit Puerto Rico over the countries that lacked a formal form of association. Among the perceived advantages was free commerce and the partial devolution to the Puerto Rican Treasury of the earnings gathered from the sale of local products. The following day these terms were supported by the PPD's leadership, establishing the party's ideological tendency as one of support to a form of association that relied on reclaiming the national sovereignty of Puerto Rico. That same year, Fernós was elected Resident Commissioner for the PPD and began promoting that Puerto Rico reclaimed its sovereignty from the United States Congress, while also conserving an economic link between both. Once in Washington, he [...] created friendships with several Congressmen and functionaries of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), which went on to become influential allies.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{proposals}} pursuing an unrefined form {{of sovereign}} association {{emerged during the}} 1880s and 1920s, but failed to gain an immediate foothold. The current territorial Commonwealth status is the consequence of its architect's inability to implement his original vision. When first proposed by Resident Commissioner Antonio Fernós-Isern, the concept was akin {{to a form of}} sovereign free association such as the one found in the Commonwealth realms. In 1950, Fernós used his function as Resident Commissioner to influence a process held between March 30 and July 3, that ended with the approval of Public Law 600, which allowed Puerto Rico to draft its own Constitution and adopt a new political system. He expected that by adopting this law, the control that the United States retained would only be considered a form of trusteeship, with sovereignty being partially split between both sides due to voluntary relegation, in line with the United Nations Trusteeship Council. At the moment Fernós expected that the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause</b> would not apply after reclaiming sovereignty, {{due to the fact that}} the United States never incorporated Puerto Rico. During the original negotiation process in Congress, Fernós was aware that several key elements of his project were being removed, but opted to focus on its initial approval, believing that he would not be able to accomplish everything at once. Under these arguments, the adoption of Law 600 was approved on June 5, 1951. The name of Estado Libre Asociado (lit. [...] "Associated Free State") was adopted as the official Spanish name, while the official English name avoided naming any form of association or freedom, simply being called [...] "Commonwealth".|$|E
2500|$|This {{decision}} was sorely taken by {{several members of}} the PPD due to its sudden turn towards the right and the term [...] "permanent union" [...] was criticized, being perceived as a synonym for [...] "eventual statehood". Despite representing a significant conflict between the ideologies of his ideology [...] and Muñoz's, Fernós reluctantly included this language to the revised bill. Despite representing a contrast to his own beliefs, he was involved in the process, spending hours on it. On the other hand, Muñoz's own posture became even more conservative, leading to an argument in favor of allowing the residents of the territories to vote for the President of the United States, an act that would require an amendment to the United States Constitution and also served as an indirect recognition of the fact that Puerto Rico was still under the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause.</b> This led to an unintentional debate, where the tax exemptions of Puerto Rico, when compared to other territories, became a hot topic. Muñoz responded that once the economy allowed it, Puerto Rico would contribute to the Federal Government like the [...] incorporated jurisdictions. This argument, which would place the Commonwealth even closer to statehood, was opposed by Fernós who claimed that the economic relation between both parts should be akin to that of two countries, and as such, it unnecessary for one to cost the government expenses for the other. While the bill stalled in Congress, a local referendum was proposed by Fernós with the intention of disabling the pro-statehood faction. The date of this referendum led to another conflict between both leaders and once again, the position of Muñoz prevailed.|$|E
2500|$|The Fernós-Murray Project also {{presented}} {{the possibility that}} the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico could appeal directly to the United States Supreme Court. The bill was not well received, especially by the Federal military agencies and the Secretary of the Interior. The debate began in the United States House of Representative's Committee of Interior and Insular Affairs led by US Rep. Wayne Aspinall. The US Senate was intending to wait the US House's analysis, a development that favored Fernós' strategy due to his reputation there. However, after the possibility of a pro-statehood referendum was considered, Muñoz decided to take a counterintuitive step and involved US Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, leading to the Senate's action. By altering Fernós's strategy, the process took a turn to the worst, when it conflicted with US Sen. Henry M. Jackson, the congressman directly in charge of the debate status within the Senate. In the subsequent public hearings, Jackson {{went on to become the}} notable figure to notice that under the Commonwealth, Puerto Rico was still under the jurisdiction of the <b>territorial</b> <b>clause,</b> exposing the contradictions between this fact and the case that the United States had presented before the United Nations. Now aware of this position, Fernós reunited with Edward S. Corwin who offered a supporting opinion. Furthermore, a PPD reunion led by Muñoz further shifted the party's position to a more conservative posture, which was included in a revised bill that was presented before Congress in September 1959. This new posture, which discarded independence as a potential development and introduced an ambiguous support for future statehood [...] "once the economic level matched that of other states", was responsible for introducing the term [...] "permanent union" [...] to the PPD's internal status debate and, as a direct consequence, began alienating Fernós and his vision of a sovereign development.|$|E
