The generalized UniFrac distance corrects the limitation of the weighted/weighted UniFrac distance by down-weighting their emphasis on either abundant or rare lineages.|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the actual}} WACC with the {{textbook}} WACC, the textbook formula overestimates the actual WACC for small levels of leverage, and underestimates it for {{higher levels of}} leverage. As Miles and Ezzell (1980) point out, the textbook formula assumes a constant level of leverage over time. In our model, however, an initially high level of leverage decreases over time, on average (in terms of expectations), as a positive development of the EBIT flow strengthens the equity value more than it does the debt value. Hence, the textbook formula puts too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the cost of debt, and {{as the cost of}} debt is smaller than the cost of equity, it underestimates the actual WACC. On the other hand, an initially low level of leverage increases over time (on average). The reason is that while a positive development of the EBIT flow can further decrease an initially very low leverage only marginally, a negative development of the EBIT flow can substantially increase the leverage. Hence, the textbook formula puts too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the cost of equity, and, as it is larger than the cost of debt, overestimates the actual WACC.|$|R

30|$|There are {{different}} ways to assess the efficiency of a numerical prediction [68]. Mean Squared Error (MSE – Equation 1) is used to report {{the average of the}} squared errors. By taking the square root of MSE, one can express the error in the same dimension as the estimated value (RMSE – Equation 2). One important limitation of squared errors is that they put too <b>much</b> <b>weight</b> <b>on</b> the effect of outliers, and in this case reporting the absolute errors is a good alternative (MAE – Equation 3).|$|R
