Wetzler wrote in his memoir that they <b>tied</b> <b>strips</b> of flannel across their mouths and tightened them whenever they felt a tickle in their throats. At 9pm on 10 April, they crawled out of the wood pile and headed south toward Slovakia [...] away, walking parallel to the Soła river.|$|R
25|$|The use of hand {{protection}} in fighting contests undertaken for sport {{has been known}} since Ancient Greece. However, the gloves were very {{different from those of}} modern boxing, as was the sport itself. In Ancient Greece, it was common practice to <b>tie</b> <b>strips</b> of rawhide round the hands for protection. In Roman times, this developed into the gladiatorial cestus, with metal added to the gloves to inflict greater damage. The brutality of the sport caused the boxing to be banned in AD 393.|$|R

An inquiry by Defence resulted in soldiers being counselled over the manner and measure of their response.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the film, Lightning is portrayed as being ungrateful, obnoxious, selfish, and sarcastic. It is noted that he previously fired three crew chiefs. During a pit stop, he foolishly refuses the advice of his pit crew to replace his tires because he wants to remain in the lead. As a result, both rear tires blow out on the last lap. He narrowly avoids losing the race when he sticks his tongue out, leading to a three-way <b>tie</b> with <b>Strip</b> [...] "The King" [...] Weathers and Chick Hicks. He subsequently insults his pit crew, leading them to furiously and suddenly resign.|$|R

The Stalker tells his clients they must do exactly as he says to survive the dangers which lie ahead and explains the Zone's dangers are invisible. The Stalker tests for traps by throwing metal nuts <b>tied</b> to <b>strips</b> of cloth ahead of them. The complicated path that they must take cannot be specifically seen nor heard but can only be sensed. The shortest path is never the straight path.|$|R

25|$|Hangars {{with open}} {{superstructures}} often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation {{especially in the}} evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. <b>tying</b> the <b>strips</b> {{to the side of}} the door) by the personnel in the hangar concern (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010).|$|R

40|$|African {{countries}} with hot, arid climates or {{even those with}} waterlogged or salty clay soils may have an ally in a versatile tree species found in Namibia. Terminalia sericea has spread naturally over a former war-zone area that had been cleared mechanically and by herbicide prior to 1978. Since that time the tree growth has been vigorous and the soil appears well restored. Terminalia sericea is a semi-deciduous tree 3 - 13 metres tall. It grows abundantly in less populated areas of northern Namibia as well as around the Kalahari desert. As {{long as it is}} not subject to heavy competition for light, the species thrives across a range of soil-composition moisture and drainage conditions. It is an aggressive colonizer forming dense pioneer thickets on new alluvial, eroded or deteriorated soils. The trees improve sites by draining waterlogged soils, enriching impoverished soils and shading out weeds, allowing climax species to move in. Its seeds regenerate readily as open sites become available. The tree has man useful qualities. The wood is yellow, grained, hard, heavy and very tough and the heartwood is durable, being both termite- and borer-proof. As well as the wood making good fencing and building material, the bark of Terminalia can be harvested and used also in construction as <b>tieing</b> <b>strips.</b> The roots have medicinal properties. Terminal serica is a potential candidate for reforestation, erosion control and agroforestry at similar sites in other African countries.

50|$|Other {{analogous}} strips can {{be obtained}} by similarly joining strips with two or more half-twists in them instead of one. For example, a strip with three half-twists, when divided lengthwise, becomes a twisted <b>strip</b> <b>tied</b> in a trefoil knot. (If this knot is unravelled, the strip has eight half-twists.) A strip with N half-twists, when bisected, becomes a strip with N + 1 full twists. Giving it extra twists and reconnecting the ends produces figures called paradromic rings.|$|R
40|$|Identification of an {{individual}} seahorse is important for captive breeding and conservation studies. A simple and cost-effective tagging method was devised to suit the rigid body structure and small fins of Hippocampus kuda. The first generation sexually matured individuals (452 numbers) were tagged using plastic <b>strips</b> <b>tied</b> around the neck. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) in growth between the tagged and untagged groups were noted. All the tags persisted for one year without any perceptible changes in sexual and social behaviour...|$|R
50|$|Many rapes {{occur in}} public spaces {{and in the}} {{presence}} of witnesses. These public rapes have become so popular that they have been given a name—“la reigne”. During these rapes, women are <b>stripped,</b> <b>tied</b> upside down, and gang raped {{in the middle of a}} village. The permission to invade and rape a village is often given as a reward to the armed group by the commanders. The government army, FARDC, due to its size and capacity, is the largest perpetrator.|$|R
50|$|Other {{percussion}} instruments such as sanba (三板), yotsutake (四つ竹) and hyōshigi (拍子木) {{can often}} be heard in Okinawan music. Sanba are three small, flat pieces of wood or plastic {{that are used to}} make rapid clicking sounds, similar to castanets. Yotsutake are two sets of rectangular bamboo <b>strips</b> <b>tied</b> together, one set held in each hand, clapped together on the strong beat of the music. Traditionally they have been used in Ryukyuan classical music, but recently they have been used in eisa dancing.|$|R
50|$|Gordon uses {{comic strips}} {{to make an}} {{argument}} about American culture. He says that comic strips {{were one of the}} first forms of truly national culture, by which he means {{people all over the country}} read them on the same day, and so had shared experiences, and that this happened on a widespread basis as early as 1908. He also <b>ties</b> comic <b>strips</b> to transformations in advertising styles, and not just the comic strip advertising style of the 1930s but the generalized use of more images in advertising as the twentieth century progressed. The book even has a chapter on the beginnings of comic books, which is a useful short overview and has good information on the early Superman. On 11 April 2011 he created an online version of the book which can be found at academia.edu.|$|R
50|$|A masonry veneer wall {{consists}} of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed {{on one or}} {{both sides of a}} structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry. In this context the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The brick veneer is generally connected to the structural wall by brick <b>ties</b> (metal <b>strips</b> that are attached to the structural wall, as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer). There is typically an air gap between the brick veneer and the structural wall. As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the structural wall will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and weep holes can be left {{at the base of the}} brick veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the second Chernobyl disaster, The Zone is {{littered}} with small areas of altered physics, known as anomalies. There are several different variations, each one having a unique impact upon those who cross its path. They can be potentially deadly to the player and other NPCs, delivering electric shocks, or pulling them into the air and crushing them. Most anomalies produce visible air or light distortions and their extent can be determined by throwing bolts (of which the player carries an infinite supply) to trigger them. Some stalkers also possess an anomaly detector, which emits warning beeps of a varying frequency depending on their proximity to an anomaly. The guide in the film Stalker, and his predecessors in the Strugatsky brothers' book Roadside Picnic, test various routes before proceeding. In the film, metal nuts <b>tied</b> with <b>strips</b> of cloth are used.|$|R
50|$|Phillips {{moved to}} New York City, where she formed a fake band with Cortez and Duncan Smith in 1977. She had a dominatrix act at CBGB with Terry Sellers. Phillips worked with Cortez to shoot his film Grutzi Elvis in Munich. In March 1978 Phillips first {{encountered}} James Chance and the Contortions, at a Colab benefit for X Motion Picture magazine. Phillips persuaded Maas {{to open a}} club, envisioning it as an elegant place called the Molotov Cocktail Lounge. She was to manage the club, but her involvement ended after a dispute with Maas. Instead {{she went on to}} manage the Contortions and, for a brief period, Lydia Lunch. For the Contortions' debut album Buy, she photographed Sellers wearing an outfit designed by Phillips for the album's cover artwork. Not knowing how to sew, she designed dresses by <b>tying</b> together <b>strips</b> of cloth. Singer Debbie Harry wore some of Phillips' creations.|$|R
50|$|In May 1966, Mao Zedong purged Politburo member, Beijing party chief Peng Zhen {{and started}} the decade-long Cultural Revolution. As Lin Tie was {{associated}} with the political network of Peng Zhen, Governor Liu Zihou took the opportunity to make a bid for the top office of Hebei. Liu courted Li Xuefeng, party chief of North China which includes Hebei province, and denounced Lin <b>Tie.</b> Lin was <b>stripped</b> of all his positions and imprisoned in a military compound. Liu subsequently persecuted many war heroes including his own former associates, resulting in at least 33 deaths.|$|R
5000|$|In The Final Solution, the {{government}} was usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed; the first Strontium Dogs story had it that after {{the destruction of the}} New Church by the Strontium Dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. Crossroads, in prog 898, revealed that Earth was in a severe political mess, with twenty six [...] "minor wars", {{and the rest of the}} galaxy was cutting <b>ties.</b> The later <b>strip</b> The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha ignored all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government.|$|R
5000|$|The ritual on {{the final}} day of the festival is known as [...] "Wang" [...] {{performed}} at the monastery. On this occasion, sweets called Tseril are prepared by mixing barley and sugar or molasses and then solidifying it, which is then made into small balls. Prayers are then offered by the Head Lama, which is followed by distribution of the Tseril. Along with the sweets, local beer called Tse-Chang is also served in a bowl made of human skull. The oblation of Tse-Chang is distributed in a very small quantity, of say a few drops to the devotees. After this ritual, the Head Lama gives blessings, called the Tse-Boom. He blesses all the assembled devotees by touching their heads; during this process the other lamas <b>tie</b> small <b>strips</b> of cloth, of half to one inch width, of white, red or blue or other colors, on the wrist of devotees. Concurrently, strips of yellow cloth are tied by a senior Lama around the neck of all lamas and Anis (nuns), as a sign of blessings for happiness and long life.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the royal}} {{response}} {{put an end}} to executions, the Puritans continued to find ways to harangue the Quakers who came to Massachusetts. In 1661 they passed the [...] "Cart and Tail Law", having Quakers <b>tied</b> to carts, <b>stripped</b> to the waist, and dragged through various towns behind the cart, being whipped en route, until they were taken out of the colony. At about the time that Endicott died in 1665, a royal commission directed that all legal actions taken against Quakers would cease. Nevertheless, whippings and imprisonments continued into the 1670s, after which popular sentiment, coupled with the royal directives, finally {{put an end to}} the Quaker persecution.|$|R
40|$|The control {{network of}} Mars is {{composed}} of Mariner 9 frames which essentially give full coverage of the planet at low resolution. Superimposed on and tied to this network are strips of Viking mapping frames (resolution 100 to 250 m per pixel) which encircle the equator and 60 deg north latitude and multiple longitude ties between these latitude strips. There are multiple <b>ties</b> between these <b>strips</b> and the Viking 1 lander site. In the future another strip will be established at 60 deg south latitude. Because the Viking 1 lander site has been accurately located, the coordinates of points in its vicinity can be determined with an error of less than 100 m relative to an inertial coordinate system...|$|R
50|$|A double row of {{contrasting}} marks {{down the}} center of the shield, known as imigabelo (singular: umgabelo), are both ornamental and a convenient way of fastening the handle. They are crafted by passing contrastingly coloured strips of hide through a double row of slits, which are cut while the hide is still wet and pliant. Thong loops <b>tie</b> the <b>strips</b> and the shield's handle to a stout removable staff, known as the mgobo, which runs {{down the center}} of the shield. It is long enough to project at both ends, and strengthens the shield and prevents it from bending. It also assists the warrior or dancer to swing it about rapidly. The shield can be rested on the lower projection of the staff when a warrior is tired. The lower projection could also be sharpened to stab at the legs of an enemy combatant. The shield should be tall enough that the warrior can just glance over its top. The top of the stick reaches the crown of the warrior's head, and is decorated by strips of furry skin which are wound around it. The Mpondos used black ostrich feathers instead.|$|R
5000|$|Harun's role in {{the riot}} is not exactly clear. Although the rally was {{to be held at}} his house (in which two {{innocent}} Chinese bystanders were killed) [...] and then parade around the town, it has been claimed by some - including a member of the opposition in the state assembly and Parliament at the time - that Harun was too pre-occupied with trying to form a new state government to have given much thought to the rally, although it is not denied that he approved it. It has also been claimed that during the riot, Harun sheltered some Chinese who had been forced into the mosque he attended by the rioters. There are also accusations that the Malays who gathered at his house were supplied with knives and machetes. After meeting in large numbers at Harun's official residence in Jalan Raja Muda near Kampong Bahru, and hearing inflammatory speeches by Harun and other leaders, the Malay mobs prepared themselves by <b>tying</b> ribbon <b>strips</b> on their foreheads and set out to kill Chinese. The first hapless victims were two of them in a van opposite Harun's house who were innocently watching the large gathering. Little did they know that they would be killed on the spot.|$|R

The report that a Popish plot had been discovered, and that a number of important arrests had been made, spread quickly, as the soldiers were seen gathered round the house.

He {{dressed in}} fine black, {{and there was a}} suggestion of Roman drapery in his long coat-skirts. His collars were [...] "undetached" [...] (blame haberdashery for the word); his tie was a narrow, funereal <b>strip,</b> <b>tied</b> in the same knot as were his shoe-strings. His gray hair was a trifle too long behind, but he kept it smooth and orderly. His face was clean-shaven, like the old statesmen's. Most people thought it a stern face, but when its official expression was off, a few had seen altogether a different countenance. Especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child.|$|R
