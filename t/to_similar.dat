40|$|Maincrop potato yields in Scotland have {{increased}} by 3035 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1 since 1960 {{as a result}} of many changes, but has changing climate contributed anything to this? The purpose of this work was to answer this question. Daily weather data for the period 19602006 were analysed for five locations covering the zones of potato growing on the east coast of Scotland (between 55. 213 and 57. 646 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> N) to determine trends in temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. A physiologically based potato yield model was validated using data obtained from a long-term field trial in eastern Scotland and then employed to simulate crop development and potential yield at each of the five sites. Over the 47 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> years, there were significant increases in annual air and 30 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> cm soil temperatures (0. 27 and 0. 30 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> K <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> decade- 1, respectively), but no significant changes in annual precipitation or in the timing of the last frost in spring and the first frost of autumn. There was no evidence of any north to south gradient of warming. Simulated emergence and canopy closure became earlier at all five sites over the period with the advance being greater in the north (3. 7 and 3. 6 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> days <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> decade- 1, respectively) than the south (0. 5 and 0. 8 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> days <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> decade- 1, respectively). Potential yield increased with time, generally reflecting the increased duration of the green canopy, at average rates of 2. 8 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1 decade- 1 for chitted seed (sprouted prior to planting) and 2. 5 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1 decade- 1 for unchitted seed. The measured warming could contribute potential yield increases of up <b>to</b> 13. 2 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1 for chitted potato (range 7. 119. 3 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1) and 11. 5 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1 for unchitted potato (range 7. 115. 5 <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> t <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> ha- 1) equivalent to 3439 % of the increased potential yield over the period or 2326 % of the increase in actual measured yields...|$|R

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject <b>to</b> <b>similar</b> cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThree loess {{sections}} in the Loess Plateau of China {{have been studied}} to characterize the variations of the East Asian monsoon climate in the Late Quaternary period. Paleo-weathering profiles based on two weathering indices reveal a series of spatially correlative intervals of lower weathering intensity (LW), in the last glacial and late penultimate glacial loess, indicating significantly cooler or/and drier conditions. Most of them are identified {{at or near the}} transitional boundaries between loess and soil units, suggesting that climatic conditions favorable for LW events tended to occur at or near major climatic boundaries. Twenty-eight radiocarbon and thermoluminescence measurements, combined with Kukla's magnetic susceptibility age model date these events at similar to- 14, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 21, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 29, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 38, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 52, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 71, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 135, and <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 145 ka BP, with <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 5 - 10 ka frequency inlaid within the orbitally induced <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> 20 -ka periodicity. The ages of the first six events in the last glacial period are therefore close to those of the coarse-grained Heinrich layers in the North Atlantic Ocean, which resulted from massive discharges of icebergs. The results indicate that the climate in the area affected by the East Asian monsoon has experienced high-frequency changes more or less synchronous with the Heinrich events. These high-frequency changes have been reported by Porter and An, based on the grain-size time series from the Luochuan loess section. Our data also reveal that similar events also occurred during the penultimate glaciation. The mechanisms linking the Heinrich events and the East Asian monsoon climate may be <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that driving the Younger Dryas event which has been identified in a large number of records in China and in the surrounding oceans...|$|R
