500|$|Busch also commented, [...] "When Jeff Gordon {{has a good}} car and he's got the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you,</b> he's going <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you,</b> there's no doubt about that. He's my hero and I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years, so it's no surprise that he beat us." [...] The race result left Kyle Busch leading the Driver's Championship with 80 points. Kurt Busch, who finished eighth, was second with 77, eight points ahead of Stewart and Allmendinger. Gordon was fifth with 65 points. Ford maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 12 points. Toyota and Chevrolet placed second and third with {{the same amount of}} points, four ahead of Dodge in fourth. 10.36 million people watched the race on television. The race took three hours, one minute and forty-nine seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.137 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Before a 1994 {{playoff game}} against the Steelers' long-time rival Cleveland Browns, Steelers {{defensive}} tackle Brentson Buckner accidentally dropped a Towel that he was waving during the player introductions. Browns running back Earnest Byner stepped on the Towel yelling, [...] "We don't care about your towel. We're going <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you</b> this time." [...] This act [...] "provok other Steelers and Browns to mingle. Not affectionately." [...] The Steelers won the game 299.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you,</b> he's going <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you.</b> He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Liverpool had lost at the Millennium Stadium. Wenger used his post-match news {{interview}} to praise goalscorer Gilberto Silva and asserted that the Brazilian would be a [...] "very strong player" [...] for the team, in the incoming future. He noted that Dudek had [...] "kept [...] in the game for a long time" [...] and was critical of Gerrard, who he felt was fortunate not to have been sent off for a [...] "reckless and dangerous" [...] challenge on Vieira. Wenger believed Arsenal's experience put the team in good stead for the upcoming season: [...] "There are two attitudes to being champions. One is to get respect, another is to get kicked more and to face more aggression as people want <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you</b> more. We are quite used to that though as we have had some big fights in the past four or five years." ...|$|E
500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. I ought <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>you</b> up.' I said, 'Go ahead – I could use the money.'" ...|$|E
