5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> fault started to uplift <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada. Subsequent tilting of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and metamorphic rock that make up <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old.

Nearly all the rock east of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E

5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Madre de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> Madre. The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sierras</b> Marginales (Spanish: Border Ranges) are <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Aragonesas and Serres Catalanes of the {{southern}} Pre-Pyrenees. They are, much like the South Pyrenean Zone, formed from a Mesozoic-Eocene sedimentary succession, albeit with a much reduced thickness of about 900 m. The succession comprises Keuper, Jurassic, unconformable lower Cretaceous bauxites, unconformable Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene in Garumnian facies, and lower Eocene. Units of <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Marginales underthrust successions of the Ebro Basin. Later on these underthrusts were unconformably covered by Oligocene and Miocene sequences from the Ebro Basin. To <b>the</b> west, <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Marginales are relayed by the Jaca-Pamplona Thrust Sheet which consists of a younger Eocene-Oligocene sedimentary succession. In this thrust sheet west of the Gállego River, the structures simplify: in the Basque and in the Cantabrian Pyrenees, the sedimentary cover is affected only by long and relatively open fold trains, which are occasionally pierced by doming Keuper salt. In <b>the</b> east, <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> Marginales are represented by the tectonically comparable Port del Comte Thrust Sheet and by the Cadí Thrust Sheet, which are made up essentially of an Eocene succession.|$|R

50|$|The {{foothills of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sierras</b> {{are known for}} their {{pleasant}} weather: summer days are slightly cooler and the air feels much dryer despite high precipitation; winters are much dryer with less fog and less wind, and more pleasant sunny days.
