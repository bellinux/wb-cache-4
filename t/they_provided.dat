5|$|Alfonso XIII {{served in}} the Spanish fleet from 1915 to 1937. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War I, and so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war. She and her sisters participated in the Rif War, where <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> gunfire support to Spanish Army forces. The ship was seized by General Francisco Franco at {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War. While steaming off Santander on 30 April 1937, she struck a mine and sank; most of her crew was taken off by the destroyer Velasco.|$|E
5|$|Early {{intervention}} {{helped to}} ensure that the Nationalist faction survived the initial stages of the war; German involvement then steadily expanded. The training <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not more so, than direct actions. Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E
5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, {{and the importance of}} the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to try to stop the standardization.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, James Patton, Maria da Silva, and Jay Malcolm {{reported}} on mammals {{collected at the}} Rio Juruá in western Brazil. In this report, <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> further information on the Oryzomys species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, including sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species {{and found that it}} was closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three O.emmonsae studied was 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|In {{domestic}} matters, Scott advocated increased {{salaries for}} public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude {{the need for}} the state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes as low as possible.

During the conflict, she was damaged by a rebel coastal battery. The ship served with the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. Nationalist bombers {{attacked}} the ship twice and on 17 June 1937, she was destroyed by an accidental explosion. The wreck was later raised and scrapped.|$|E

Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E

The Dutch Navy {{in concert with the}} British were evacuating the Dutch Royal Family and Dutch Gold reserves through the country's ports.

5|$|The large {{reservoirs}} {{along the}} Longdendale valley {{known as the}} Longdendale Chain were designed in the 1840s and completed in February 1877. <b>They</b> <b>provided</b> compensation water to ensure a continuous flow along the River Etherow which was essential for local industry, and provided pure water for Manchester. The Upper Derwent Valley reservoirs were built from the mid 20th century onward to supply drinking water to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} aircraft of her air group (16 Zeros and 17 D3As) {{were flown}} off for Rabaul on 23 October where <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> air cover for Japanese forces on Guadalcanal.

5|$|To {{develop a}} {{distinctive}} {{look for the}} various species of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the alien from human architecture. The Covenant were generally well received by critics who appreciated the challenge <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> to players; several critics lamented the change of the main enemies from Elites to Brutes in Halo 3 and conversely praised their return in the later Halo: Reach.|$|E
5|$|A European innovation, castles {{originated}} in the 9thand 10thcenturies, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them, and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were the registered Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to serfdom. Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to serfdom, and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to much political wrangling with regard {{to the size of the}} Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the Polish state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, <b>they</b> <b>provided</b> some light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
