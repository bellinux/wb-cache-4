2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness {{as studies have shown}} that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning. [...] Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> in pigs and feather pecking by hens.|$|E

The performance of codes with different rate, length, and complexity using iterative (turbo) decoding is evaluated by simulation. 1 Introduction Since the introduction of turbo decoding [1] in 1993, there has been considerable research on the investigation of parallel concatenated coding schemes employing convolutional codes (CCs) as component codes. Using block codes (BCs) as component codes has received less attention. Considering the rate loss imposed by terminating the CC, this is surprising particularly for short block lengths, and is mainly due to the favorable pr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In England 2 ̆ 6 Wales, ante and {{post-mortem}} (PM) {{data for}} lesions observed during meat inspection at the abattoir are {{recorded in the}} Food Standards Agency (FSA) Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR) system. FSA data are reported to livestock producers but are not used systematically to monitor trends of specific conditions, nor to detect changes in disease syndromes. An advantage of using FSA data for AH surveillance purposes is the high population coverage; a disadvantage {{is the lack of}} accuracy. The voluntary BPEX Pig Health Scheme, BPHS, provides more accurate reports from standardised abattoir assessments of 12 PM lesions that reflect disease and welfare conditions of economic significance. FSA data were compared with BPHS data, for respiratory and <b>tail</b> <b>bite</b> lesions, from the same period (June 2008 - May 2012). There were approximately 900, 000 BPHS pigs (from 2, 543 premises) and 19 million pigs (31, 578 premises) in CCIR. Generalised linear mixed models were used to examine the data to detect significant differences in trends and seasonality. Additionally, specific batches were compared in three abattoirs during four trials in 2013. Agreement between the two datasets, in the four trials, was evaluated using the correlation coefficient and the Kappa value, while significance was assessed using McNemar and paired t-test. National temporal trend analysis showed an increase in respiratory disease in both datasets but seasonality and prevalence differed. For <b>tail</b> <b>bite</b> lesions, the temporal trend and seasonal patterns were completely different. In the four trials, 332 batches of pigs were compared. The correlation of respiratory disease was low between the datasets as was the identification of positive batches for conditions such as <b>tail</b> <b>bite.</b> These results lead to the conclusion that, although routine meat inspection data has potential for AH surveillance purposes, it needs significant improvement to replace the BPHS...|$|R

50|$|Based on {{the results}} of the study, only 11.4% of the pigs were victims of <b>tail</b> <b>biting.</b> Weights were {{evaluated}} {{at the beginning and end}} of the study and concluded that there were no significant differences in weights (beginning and end) of victims versus nonvictims. However, it was not only the weight itself that was evaluated. The data sets of ADG, FCR, and meat % were looked at closely and it was found that non-victims had a greater ADG than victims (The study results also showed that <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> had no effect on the FCR or meat %.) It was taken into account that other factors besides <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> could have an effect on these results like breed, gender, and genetic predispositions. While these factors do affect the results, it was still found that the ADG of victims of <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> is reduced by 1 to 3%.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{perception}} is that white <b>tail</b> spider <b>bites</b> {{can be associated with}} long term skin infections, and in rarer cases progression to necrosis. This is an attribution of infections presenting to medical care with a complaint of [...] "spider bite." [...] Venom has no bacteria, and infections do not arise from spider bites. The well-described brown recluse bite is direct damage to skin and tissue. It has a limited area and does not spread.

5000|$|To {{minimize}} <b>tail</b> <b>biting,</b> toys like chains, alcathene piping, {{and rubber}} boots {{can be provided}} to redirect pigs chewing tendencies.

Tail docking {{is another way to}} prevent <b>tail</b> <b>biting.</b> This is done when piglets are 3-7 days old and should be done cleanly and efficiently by someone who is competent. Dietary supplements can be given to increase salt levels which {{has been shown to be}} effective. Salt levels should be monitored as to prevent excessive intake and salt poisoning. [...] Other things that can be monitored and adjusted are potential stressors like stocking density, temperature and ventilation regulation. In regards to stocking density, there are minimum space requirements for pigs based on weight per The Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations. Termperature and ventilation should be monitored and regulated as to prevent chilling, overheating, too much dust, gas, and ammonia buildup in turn decreasing stress induced <b>tail</b> <b>biting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>biting</b> is {{considered}} one of the major animal welfare problems affecting the fattening of pigs in the swine industry. This is because of the costs to treat and costs due to slower fattening to slaughter weight. There are factors to be taken into account when evaluating how <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> affects production since they have to do with growth, feed intake, leanness and other production traits. Some of those factors are genetics, breed, gender. A study was done to determine the effects of <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> during the entire finishing period (also known as [...] "fattening" [...] period). They used three measures to evaluate production: average daily gain (ADG), gross feed conversion ratio (FCR), and red meat percentage (meat %) which included muscle and fat thicknesses.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of tail biting: two-stage, sudden forceful, and obsessive. The type of <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> {{is based on the}} {{behaviors}} of each the biter and victim, physical consequences of the bite, and conditions under which the biting happens. A common cause of <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> is due to pigs feeling stressed or discomfort and are looking for something to divert their attention. Some other causes of <b>tail</b> <b>biting</b> involve possible breed predilections, gender, feed source, substrate materials, gastrointestinal discomfort, and general health of the pig(s). It usually starts out as the pig being curious to investigate its surroundings and begins with harmless nibbling. The nibbling then turns into biting- if blood is drawn from the bite this can cause the pig to bite even more due to their natural appetite for blood.|$|E

In contrast to Badger's death, Toad and Mossy survive the television series, the former befriending the rat who killed him in the books. The cause of Sinuous death was also changed. Of the rats, Brat originally returned to the sewers instead of being killed by Sinuous, while Bully had his <b>tail</b> <b>bitten</b> off by Cleo rather than being killed by Vixen.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "tail biting" [...] {{can be used}} to {{describe}} a range of tail manipulation behaviors from light nibbling to cannibalism.

With multiple pigs housed in one area, they can become crowded which has the potential to induce stress. Other factors in this circumstance that can cause stress in pigs are a lack of substrate material in the housing environment, a lack of ventilation, or lack of quality feed (low salt or low iron diets) or access to the feed. <b>Tail</b> <b>biting</b> even happens out of pure boredom.

40|$|Statutory {{recording}} of carcass lesions at the abattoir may have significant {{potential as a}} resource for surveillance of livestock populations. Food Standards Agency (FSA) data in Great Britain are not currently used for surveillance purposes. There are concerns that the sensitivity of detection, combined with other issues, may make the outputs unreliable. In this study we postulate that FSA data could be used for surveillance purposes. To test this we compared FSA data with BPHS (a targeted surveillance system of slaughtered pigs) and laboratory diagnostic scanning surveillance (FarmFile) data, from mid- 2008 to mid- 2012, for respiratory conditions and <b>tail</b> <b>bite</b> lesions in pigs at population level. We also evaluated the agreement/correlation at batch level between FSA and BPHS inspections in four field trials during 2013. Temporal trends and regional differences at population level were described and compared using logistic regression models. Population temporal analysis showed an increase in respiratory disease in all datasets but with regional differences. For <b>tail</b> <b>bite,</b> the temporal trend and monthly patterns were completely different between the datasets. The field trials were run in three abattoirs and included 322 batches. Pearson's correlation and Cohen's kappa tests were used to assess correlation/agreement between inspections systems. It was moderate to strong for high prevalence conditions but slight for low prevalence conditions. We conclude that there is potential to use FSA data as a component of a surveillance system to monitor temporal trends and regional differences of chosen indicators at population level. At producer level and for low prevalence conditions it needs further improvement. Overall a number of issues still need to be addressed in order to provide the pig industry with the confidence to base their decisions on these FSA inspection data. Similar conclusions, at national level, may apply to other livestock sectors but require further evaluation of the inspection and data collection processes...|$|R

Kittipong has proposed that these wounds are inflicted by pufferfishes (Monotrete cf. leiurus and M. cf. nigroviridis); though plausible, why these wounds are seldom found on H. signifer remains a mystery. Another possibility is that the truncation of the tail is self-inflicted, which would be consistent with the similar lengths of the tail remnant in all five specimens. With a particularly small mouth, this species likely feeds on small crustaceans and other benthic invertebrates. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous with females provisioning their developing embryos with histotroph ("uterine milk"). Males reach sexual maturity at around 25 cm across.|$|R
