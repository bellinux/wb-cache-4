5|$|In May 2010, a <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> {{beginning}} at 92nd Street started to dig down Second Avenue through the 72nd Street area, to 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} in December 2007, but was temporarily cancelled a year later. Construction began in May 2010. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> began work in November 2011 and completed the second tunnel in May 2013. The tunnel was opened to traffic on August 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 2007, upon {{completion}} of preliminary engineering, the MTA awarded a contract for constructing the tunnels between 92nd and 63rd Streets, a launch box for the <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> (TBM) at 92nd to 95th Streets, and access shafts at 69th and 72nd Streets. This contract, valued at $337 million, was awarded to S3, a joint venture of Schiavone Construction, Skanska USA Civil, and J.F. Shea Construction. A ceremonial groundbreaking took place on April 12, 2007, at the 99th Street tunnel segment built in the 1970s. At the time, {{it was announced that}} passengers would be able to ride trains on the new line by the end of 2013. Actual construction work began on April 23, 2007, with the relocation of utility pipes, wires, and other infrastructure, which took 14 months.|$|E

5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine,</b> were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E
25|$|An Earth Pressure Balance <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> (TBM) {{was built}} {{specifically}} for the Waterview Tunnel at the Herrenknecht factory, Guangzhou, China. Made up of 90 pieces, the TBM was 14 metres in diameter, 97 metres long, and had {{a top speed of}} 80mm per minute. The TBM arrived in Auckland on 22 July 2013, a launch ceremony was held on 31 October 2013, and excavation work began on 8 November 2013.|$|E
25|$|Underground UG1 (east to west corridor) {{tunneling}} {{work was}} completed on 17 March 2014 after <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> Helen (TBM 1) finished its task of tunneling 229m between Bangalore City railway station underground (UG) station and Kempegowda UG station (Majestic). Trackwork and 3rd rail electrification works are completed on the 4.8km eastbound tunnel of Bangalore metro's Purple line between Cubbon Park and Magadi Road, and the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) began {{end to end}} trials on the entire 18.1km Purple line which stretches from Baiyappanahalli to Mysore Road on 23 November 2015.

25|$|The tunnel {{would be}} {{constructed}} {{through the use}} of two <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> (TBMs) beneath the river bottom.|$|R
25|$|In {{planning}} {{for the construction of}} the tunnel, the possibility of using a <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Boring</b> <b>Machine</b> (TBM) was considered in 1966. Discussions were held in Australia with those that had experience with them, or had previously investigated using them, and as a result, it was felt that further investigations into the idea were justified. Rock samples were submitted to the manufacturers (Jarva Company) for an assessment of the suitability of the machines for the tunnel project. It was felt that such a machine would be able to handle the eastern end of the tunnel, but that the western end could pose problems if the rock was found to be too fractured.|$|E
25|$|The west tunnel was {{the most}} {{difficult}} of the three tunnels to excavate. It was excavated using a <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> (TBM) that took over four years to bore its way through the mountain. The TBM was launched from the Waterman Portal and tunneled in a westerly direction toward the Devil Canyon portal at a slight uphill gradient of approximately 2inches per 100 linear feet (0.17%). Crews faced many challenges during the excavation, including the 2003 Old Fire that destroyed construction equipment at the Waterman Portal and halted tunneling for ten days. Later that year, a flash flood engulfed the Waterman Portal site and submerged the TBM. It took four months to restore operations {{in the aftermath of the}} flooding.|$|E
25|$|The 63rd Street Lines were envisioned {{to connect}} the Second Avenue Subway to the BMT Broadway Line, the IND Sixth Avenue Line, and Queens. The BMT 63rd Street Line would {{directly}} connect the upper Second Avenue Line to the Broadway Line. Construction on the IND Second Avenue Line began in 1972, but was halted in 1975 due to the New York City fiscal crisis. As a result, the BMT 63rd Street Line was not finished and instead ended abruptly at Lexington Avenue-63rd Street station. In 2007, construction on the Second Avenue line recommenced and in 2011, construction started at Lexington Avenue-63rd Street to expand and renovate the station, and to complete the connection to the Second Avenue Line. This renovation removed the walls on the platforms and opened new entrances on the Third Avenue side of the station. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> being used to create the tunnels for {{the first phase of}} Second Avenue Line broke through the wall into the lower level of the BMT 63rd Street Line on September 22, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Preliminary {{engineering}} {{and a final}} tunnel design was completed by {{a joint venture between}} AECOM and Arup. The first phase was originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur from Third Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, would allow the first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction of the section between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed. On March 20, 2007, upon completion of preliminary engineering, the MTA awarded a contract for constructing the tunnels between 92nd and 63rd Streets, a launch box for the <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> (TBM) at 92nd to 95th Streets, and access shafts at 69th and 72nd Streets. This contract, valued at $337 million, was awarded to S3, a joint venture of Schiavone Construction, Skanska USA Civil, and J.F. Shea Construction. A ceremonial groundbreaking took place on April 12, 2007, in a tunnel segment built in the 1970s at 99th Street. At the time, it was announced that passengers would be able to ride trains on the new line by the end of 2013. Actual construction work began on April 23, 2007, with the relocation of utility pipes, wires, and other infrastructure.
