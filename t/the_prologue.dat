5|$|The game {{features}} four scenarios including <b>the</b> <b>prologue.</b> The actions during <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> {{determine who}} will be the central character in the story, either Jennifer Simpson or Helen Maxwell. The scenarios and player characters that follow are determined by the player's actions. There are five different endings per heroine depending on how the scenarios progress. After each scenario is a save screen and an intermission mode that allows the player to explore without the threat of Scissorman. During the intermission, the player can have conversations with various characters. The next scenario will begin after the required conditions of the intermission are met.|$|E
5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of or complete {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E

50|$|A unique {{feature of}} this drama is at the {{beginning}} of every episode, a prologue (or cold open) is shown. <b>The</b> <b>prologues</b> involve anecdotes about Do-jin, Tae-san, Yoon and Jung-rok's friendship through the years, and they carry a humorous tone with the exception of episode 16's. <b>The</b> <b>prologues</b> are not related narratively to the previous episode's ending or the present storyline, however they underline each episode's theme.|$|R
5|$|Cancellara's {{first victory}} of the 2009 season came in <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> of the Tour of California. This was his second victory {{in a row in}} <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> at the Tour of California. Cancellara then {{returned}} to the Tirreno–Adriatico, but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event. Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage. Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved no success in the early season classics; he did not finish the Tour of Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg, and he finished 49th overall in the Paris–Roubaix.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara's next victory {{came at the}} Tour de Suisse {{where he}} won <b>the</b> <b>prologue,</b> which was an {{individual}} time trial around the city of Lugano. Cancellara came close to another stage win in the stage nine individual time trial, but fell short by seventeen seconds. Next, Cancellara won <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> of the Tour de France. He then held the lead until the second stage came to an end, after stage winner Sylvain Chavanel took it away. However, Cancellara regained the lead the after {{the next day and}} held it until stage seven when Chavanel again took the lead. Later in the Tour, Cancellara won the stage nineteen individual time trial that stretched from Bordeaux to Pauillac by seventeen seconds over German rider Tony Martin.|$|E
5|$|He {{came back}} to {{competition}} on 10 June in his homeland, racing in the Tour de Suisse. Cancellara stated that he was nervous {{before the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>prologue,</b> which he finished in second position, four seconds behind the winner, 's Peter Sagan.|$|E
5000|$|New Watch has {{the typical}} {{structure}} of the Watch novels, excluding Day Watch. New Watch {{is divided into three}} stories - [...] "Vague objectives," [...] "Troublous times" [...] and [...] "Vague deeds." [...] Each story begins with a prologue followed by eight numbered chapters and, changing the usual structure, without an epilogue. Except for <b>the</b> <b>prologues,</b> <b>the</b> events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Higher Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of the Night Watch.

50|$|The Gospels {{and some}} other books within the New Testament were likely {{circulated}} around 1388, before <b>the</b> General <b>Prologue</b> was written. John Wycliffe {{did not participate in}} the writing of <b>the</b> General <b>Prologue</b> since he died in 1384 and <b>the</b> General <b>Prologue</b> was not started until about January or February 1395 and finished before January or February 1397.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel is}} divided into three stories - Destiny, Among His Own Kind, and All for My Own Kind. Each story is {{subdivided}} into a prologue followed by eight chapters in the first story, and seven chapters in each of the following stories. Except for <b>the</b> <b>prologues,</b> <b>the</b> majority of the events in each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Light Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of the Night Watch. Events in each of <b>the</b> <b>prologues,</b> as well as intermittent other events in the stories, are written in a third person narrative and take place entirely outside of Gorodetsky's presence. The entire novel is written in the past tense.|$|R
5|$|In Pressure Points, a 2001 {{novel by}} Larry Brooks, {{one of the}} book's protagonists asserts that the {{programs}} developed by Werner Erhard, William Penn Patrick, and Alexander Everett all {{came from the same}} source.

Each story begins with a prologue followed by seven numbered chapters and concluding with an Epilogue.

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> two <b>prologues</b> that prefaced <b>the</b> Rhesus {{according}} to an ancient Hypothesis to the play (both are missing in our manuscripts). In particular, it highlights the literary ambitions of these prologues as texts probably composed to serve fourth- or early third-century reperformances of the play, and explores the disparaging opinion of {{the author of the}} Hypothesis, who considered one of <b>the</b> <b>prologues</b> bad enough to have been ‘composed by actors...|$|R
5000|$|For season one, a {{voice-over}} prologue by Hugh Beaumont precedes each early episode's opening credits, {{providing a}} background to that episode's theme, and always concludes with [...] "And that's our story tonight on Leave It to Beaver." [...] <b>The</b> voice-over <b>prologues</b> are discontinued mid-season {{and replaced with}} a short scene extracted from the episode at hand. <b>The</b> <b>prologues</b> are retained in the first-season DVD release but are omitted in airings on TV Land.|$|R

5|$|All {{references}} to Romeo and Juliet, unless otherwise specified, {{are taken from}} the Arden Shakespeare second edition (Gibbons, 1980) based on the Q2 text of 1599, with elements from Q1 of 1597. Under its referencing system, which uses Roman numerals, II.ii.33 means act 2, scene 2, line 33, and a 0 {{in place of a}} scene number refers to <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> to the act.|$|E
5|$|David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth – Majordomo, {{the head}} of the {{household}} staff and Lumière's best friend, who has been transformed into a clock. He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble, often leading to friction between himself and Lumière. Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth. Stiers also narrates <b>the</b> <b>prologue.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> General <b>Prologue</b> of <b>the</b> Wycliffe Bible, also <b>the</b> Great <b>Prologue</b> of <b>the</b> Wycliffe Bible, is a 15-chapter explanation, {{generally}} {{attributed to}} John Purvey, of translation procedures {{in his later}} version of the Wycliffe Bible translation done originally by John Wycliffe in 1382-1384.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>prologues</b> to <b>the</b> {{two works}} are {{identical}} {{up until the}} arrival of Venus. In Corneille's text, Venus banishes the followers of Flora who had summoned her and calls her son Cupid to punish Psyche, whom mortals revere as a second Venus.|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>prologue,</b> John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that we do not}} have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in <b>the</b> <b>prologue</b> to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2005 Tour de France, CSC {{extended}} sponsorship until 2008 {{at a higher}} level, enabling Riis to renew the contract with Basso for an additional three years.

Team CSC won the 2005 ProTour, with Julich as the #8 ranked individual rider of the year, the highest placed rider in the team.|$|E
25|$|The iambic senarius (ia6) is the commonest metre in Roman comedy. It {{was used}} for <b>the</b> <b>prologues</b> of plays and for the more serious speeches. It is the only metre which was unaccompanied by music. This metre is {{commoner}} in Terence than in Plautus.|$|R
50|$|Contributions to Tales of Chaucer modernised {{by several}} hands (1741); Ogle covered <b>the</b> <b>prologues</b> and {{seven of the}} Canterbury Tales. He also {{supplied}} {{a continuation of the}} squire's tale from the fourth book of Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, later issued separately as Cambuscan, or the Squire's Tale (1785).|$|R
40|$|Many of Miguel de Unamuno’s works {{probe the}} nature of reality and its {{boundaries}} within texts. This preoccupation with the control an author holds or loses over a text provides ample material for {{a deeper understanding of}} the complex prologic structure of his novel Niebla, including its various epitexts. This article contextualizes the ways in which the author approaches the reader and the positions that author and reader gain and switch regarding the medium. As the article shows, not only is it clear that <b>the</b> <b>prologues</b> are an integral part of the metafictional construct that Niebla is, but they are also apparent solutions that help explain the contradictions created when the authorship of <b>the</b> <b>prologues</b> turns out not to withstand the complexity of Unamuno's metafictional creation as a whole...|$|R
