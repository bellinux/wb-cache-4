5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s. Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
5|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{has similar}} {{gameplay}} to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing {{games of the}} 16-bit era, the game displays a top-down perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, {{as opposed to the}} three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} {{have all been}} slightly altered from the original story in the novel.

25|$|Gang wars: Battles with enemy gangs are {{prompted}} {{whenever the}} player ventures into enemy territory and kills {{at least three}} gang members. If the player then survives three waves of enemies, the territory will be won and fellow gang members will begin wandering the streets of these areas.

Occasionally, the player's territory will come under attack from enemy gangs and defeating <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> necessary to retain these areas. Once all marked territories are claimed {{from one of the}} two hostile gangs for the protagonist's gang, the opposing gang can no longer attack. Once the player takes control of all the territories, none can come under attack.|$|E
25|$|Atlantika - Atlantika is a Philippine fantasy-drama series {{produced}} by GMA Network about the fictional undersea kingdom of Atlantika. Atlantika opens with {{the tale of}} three lovers: Haring Agat (Gardo Versoza), Reyna Celebes (Jean García) and Barracud (Ariel Rivera). Their love triangle sparks a war that divides the underwater domain and pushes Barracud to the dark side. Aquano the Senturyon (Dingdong Dantes) must fulfill his duty of saving Atlantika by searching for the two lost princesses of the kingdom. One of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the woman destined for him (Ruana) while the other must be defeated before she destroys Atlantika itself (Amaya).

25|$|Benny— Benny {{has been}} the most heavily altered from the {{original}} novel. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the novel, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psycho-drama places him in stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which of <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating— but is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain, but restores it for the scenario so that he can think clearly again - then AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on any thoughts he has. Eventually Benny demonstrates the compassion he once lacked by saving a mutant child from the lottery, sacrificing himself in the child's stead.|$|E
