A secondary purpose was to investigate the relationship between <b>turn</b> <b>time,</b> the components that influence <b>turn</b> <b>time,</b> and performance in competitive swimming. Fifty-eight swimmers (24 female, 34 male) from four NCAA Division I schools were videotaped in the 100 and 200 yd freestyle and backstroke events during three collegiate competitions. The freestyle was shown to be significantly different from the backstroke in race <b>time,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>time,</b> and time during the in phase of the turn for both genders in the 100 and 200 yard events. Significant positive correlations were found between <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> and race time across both genders and all four events.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Falls are a {{major problem}} for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many studies {{indicate}} that more than 50 % of people with PD have difficulty in turning that may lead to falls during daily activities. The aims of this study were to identify the relationship between turning performance and falls, and to determine the factors that influence turning performance. METHODS: This study examined 45 patients with idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 - 3) using a battery of tests, including 180 ° <b>turn</b> <b>time,</b> balance, and muscle strength. The levels of disease severity and freezing of gait were also measured. The number of falls in the past 6 months was recorded. RESULTS: Sixteen out of forty-five participants experienced falls in the past 6 months. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed that <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> was highly related to falls [more affected side: sensitivity = 0. 81, specificity = 0. 79, area under the curve (AUC)  = 0. 83; less affected side: sensitivity = 0. 88, specificity = 0. 76, AUC = 0. 83]. The most important factor influencing <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> was balance ability (both sides: p = 0. 000) according to the regression model. Correlations between <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> and dynamic balance were further established with reaction time, movement velocity, endpoint excursion, and maximal excursion of the LOS (limits of stability) test. CONCLUSION: The time needed to complete a 180 ° turn during the SQT (step/quick turn) test is a good index to differentiate fallers from non-fallers in persons with PD. <b>Turn</b> <b>time</b> is most influenced by balance. Furthermore, balance control, especially in an anterior or sideways direction, is important for turning performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Barley showed significant separability from spring wheat, both multitemporally {{and on a}} single date chosen near the <b>turning</b> <b>time</b> for barley. Oats showed occasional multitemporal separability from barley and spring wheat; however, {{the cause of this}} separability was not well understood. Oats showed no significant separability from spring wheat on any single date during the growing season. By pooling data from segments having an acquisition near the <b>turning</b> <b>time</b> for barley, a fixed unitemporal projection for aiding in the labeling of barley versus spring wheat and oats was constructed. This projection has about the same separability of barley from spring wheat and oats as the unitemporal greeness versus brightness plot. The new fixed projection has the advantage that barley occurs consistently in the same general location on the plot with respect to spring wheat and oats. Attempts to construct a fixed multitemporal or a segment-dependent multitemporal projection for aiding in the labeling of spring wheat versus other small grains were unsuccessful due to segment availability and the fact that each segment has a unique acquisition history...|$|E

40|$|Warning {{systems are}} being {{developed}} for left-turning vehicles at intersections where protected left-turns are not warranted or cannot be provided, based on limitations of right of way or intersection capacity. These are meant to provide warnings to left-turning vehicles of vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, when the time to turn may be deemed unsafe. To implement these warning systems, {{it is necessary to}} estimate in near real time, the probability of conflict between the two approaching vehicles. A study is being conducted with the help of video and radar at various intersections, to obtain estimates of <b>turning</b> <b>time</b> and acceptable gaps for drivers under various situations. Initial pilot observations indicate that the presence of pedestrians in intersections had an immediate and substantial impact on movement of left turning vehicles. From a preliminary systematic video analysis of the intersection, in the presence of pedestrians on the destination crosswalk, the mean and standard deviation of both the gap and gap components (i. e., <b>turning</b> <b>time</b> and the “buffer” between the turning vehicle and the next oncoming vehicle) increased. On the basis of these observations, pedestrian-detection mechanisms may be useful in such intersection warning systems, with a threshold for warning that is adjusted for pedestrians when they are present or {{in the vicinity of the}} destination crosswalk...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{machines}} spend {{a significant}} part of their time on non-productive operations such as maneuvering near the boundaries of the field and loading or offloading of inputs or outputs (here referred to as servicing). This paper integrates existing methods for route optimization so as to minimize the time spent on turns and machine servicing on fields cultivated in straight rows. The following variables are optimized: (1) the orientation (angle) of the tracks, (2) the order of tracks, and (3) the types of turns between tracks. The angle of the tracks relative to field boundaries influences the number and lengths of the machine tracks, the number of turns and the positions where the machine can be serviced. Track order and the type of turns are selected to achieve overall efficiency. The algorithm was tested by computing routes for a set of fields of different sizes and assuming different operations. On small fields that do not require servicing, optimizing the turns between tracks resulted in a reduction of up to 50 % in <b>turning</b> <b>time</b> compared to the prevailing practice of navigation between adjacent tracks. A comparison of two sprayers in terms of servicing efficiency suggested that the algorithm can help selecting machinery for given field geometries. In some cases requiring machine servicing, the track orientation giving the shortest <b>turning</b> <b>time</b> did not produce the least servicing time. This illustrates that machine servicing should be taken into consideration for global optimization of machine traffic...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a method for quantitatively and objectively {{assessing}} 180 degree turns using low cost video sensors. A three-dimensional voxel reconstruction, which is built using silhouettes captured from two calibrated web camera views, is used to represent the human body. Experiments were conducted in which participants performed the standard Timed Up and Go tests where 180 degree turns are evaluated. Our two calibrated cameras captured the images during the test. Two key parameters including <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> and <b>turn</b> steps are extracted using the voxel data. Good agreement for the <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> was found for our system compared to the expert rating. The extracted numbers of turn steps are one step less than the expert rating in many test runs. The difference comes mainly from {{the nature of the}} pivot turns, and the <b>turn</b> <b>time</b> difference between the expert rating and the algorithm, namely the determination of the time duration from the beginning {{to the end of the}} turn. The development of this technology provides potential for assessing 180 degree turns in the home setting as part of a balance, stability and fall risk assessment tool. I...|$|R

The results of trial are stated below. 　 1) The size of steady turning diameter depended on the rudder angle and was little affected by the turning speed. 　 2) The ratio of the steady turning diameter to the ship length between perpendiculars (D/L) was inversely proportional to the rudder angle, and its regression formula was expressed as y= 20. 361 x-^l.

Accordingly, Sugihara's nomogram can be applied to a twin-engine, twin-propeller, and twin-rudder ship also. 　 6) As for the effect of ship's bottom fouling on the turning diameter, the steady turning diameter varied inversely with the period elapsed from the last bottom cleaning in a dock, and its regression formula at 10 and 20 degrees of rudder angle were expressed as y_ 1 O°=- 0. 6313 x^ 2 - 0. 7471 x + 394. 8 and Y_ 20 °=- 0. 6529 x^ 2 + 4. 2921 x+ 189. 4 respectively...|$|E
