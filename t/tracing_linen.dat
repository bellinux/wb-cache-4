50|$|At a young age, {{both boys}} were {{instructed}} in technical drawing with pencil, charcoal and ink on <b>tracing</b> <b>linen</b> with T-square and triangle. The art of Frederic Remington was a drawing inspiration to Fran√ßois as his surviving sketch books attest with pages of animals, in particular horses.|$|E
50|$|The Shenandoah Valley {{had never}} been mapped in detail before. Running 150 miles in length and 25 miles wide, it was a {{daunting}} task, but Hotchkiss accepted the assignment, and worked on the map {{for the remainder of}} the war. In order to accommodate his large scale of 1:80,000, he glued together three portions of <b>tracing</b> <b>linen</b> to form a large single map of 7 feet by 3 feet.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the domains}} where the {{typometer}} was {{most widely used}} was the editorial offices of newspapers and magazines, where it was used along with other tools such as <b>tracing</b> paper and <b>linen</b> testers to define {{the layout of the}} pages of the publications, until the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|El-Amra shows four cattle {{standing}} in a row, depicted with black and white markings, with horns turned in and downwards. The head {{of one of the}} cows is missing, as are various parts of horns. This model was placed in a tomb, presumably to represent a source of food available to the deceased in the afterlife. At this very early stage of domestication Egyptian cattle were probably used mainly as a source of blood rather than for meat or dairy products. <b>Traces</b> of <b>linen</b> survive on the model, suggesting it was either placed in the grave under a cloth, or completely wrapped in one.|$|R
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint <b>traces</b> of <b>linen</b> cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|R

50|$|The {{invention}} and {{introduction of the}} mouldboard plough revolutionised agriculture in Scandinavia in the early Viking Age and {{made it possible to}} farm even the poor soils. In Ribe, grains of rye, barley, oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined, and these are believed to have been cultivated locally. Grains and flour were used for making porridges, some cooked with milk, some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey, and also various forms of bread. Remains of bread from primarily Birka in Sweden were made of barley and wheat. It is unclear if the Norse leavened their breads, but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did. Flax was a very important crop for the Vikings: it was used for oil extraction, food consumption and most importantly the production of linen. More than 40% of all known textile recoveries from the Viking Age can be <b>traced</b> as <b>linen.</b> This suggests a much higher actual percentage, as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool for example.|$|R
6000|$|We must note another trait. After {{the body}} of Patroclus was recovered, it was washed, anointed, laid on a bier, and covered {{from head to foot}} [Greek: heano liti], {{translated}} by Helbig, [...] "with a linen sheet" [...] (cf. XXIII. 254). The golden cup with the ashes is next wrapped [Greek: heano liti]; here Mr. Myers renders the words [...] "with a linen veil." [...] Scottish cremation burials of the Bronze Age retain <b>traces</b> of <b>linen</b> wrappings of the urn. [Footnote: Proceedings of the Scottish society of Antiquaries, 1905, p. 552. For other cases, cf. Leaf, Iliad, XXIV. 796. Note.] Over all a white [Greek: pharos] (mantle) was spread. In Iliad, XXIV. 231, twelve [Greek: pharea] with chitons, single cloaks, and other articles of dress, are taken to Achilles by Priam as part of the ransom of Hector's body. Such is the death-garb of Patroclus; but Helbig, looking for Ionian innovations in Book XXIV., finds that the death-garb of Hector {{is not the same as}} that of Patroclus in Book XXIII. One difference is that when the squires of Achilles took the ransom of Hector from the waggon of Priam, they left in it two [Greek: pharea] and a well-spun chiton. The women washed and anointed Hector's body; they clad him in the chiton, and threw one [Greek: pharos] over it; we are not told what they did with the other. Perhaps, as Mr. Leaf says, it was used as a cover for the bier, perhaps it was not, but was laid under the body (Helbig). All we know is that Hector's body was restored to Priam in a chiton and a [Greek: pharos], which do not seem to have been removed before he was burned; while Patroclus had no chiton in death, but a [Greek: pharos] and, apparently, a linen sheet.|$|R
