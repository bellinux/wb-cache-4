40|$|According to many {{authors who}} have studied the {{relations}} of cognitive and motor skills (Ismail, Madić), {{there is a relationship}} between these two anthropological spaces. Motor skill is related with cognitive factor, especially in these tasks which have unusual rhythmic structure where speed and accuracy of performance is needed. As many test tasks for evaluation of coordination are designed in exactly the same manner, it may be assumed that there is a relation with cognitive skills of students performing these exercises. Relations between cognitive skills and coordination in rhythm are evaluated on the sample of 217 students of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education in Novi Sad. For evaluation of cognitive skills, we have used the battery of tests KOG 3 (Wolf, Momirović & Džamonja, 1992). For coordination in rhythm, we have used the following tests: <b>tapping</b> on horizontal <b>plates,</b> <b>tapping</b> on <b>plates</b> in three plane surfaces, and tapping with hands and feet.

Detailed model studies were made {{for the design of}} a gauging structure in the Hunter River for the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The structure is to be located downstream of the Liddell Power Station cooling water pump intake at Jerry 1 s Plains. The problem is to design a structure at minimum cost, suitable for telemetry which will run with the minimum of maintenance and attention, with reliability and with accuracy especially at low flows; notwithstanding the wide range of river flows, the heavy bed load, the risk of outflanking and the risk of structural collapse due to scour. Two dimensional tests were made in a narrow flume of weir sections at prototype scales {{to determine the effects of}} a wide range of bed load sediment sizes. Tests were also made of proposed structures in a large moving bed model of the Hunter River. A sloping line crest weir 16 5 feet long of Crump section proved to be most satisfactory, with the crest sloping 2 feet across the river.

Girls with TS aged 10 - 18 years (n = 184), and age- and stature-matched healthy controls (n = 280) were studied with the use of the EUROFIT test battery. Girls with TS were significantly inferior to the control group in maintaining balance, standing broad jump, sit-ups, shuttle run, and endurance shuttle run (p <. 001). No significant differences were found for <b>plate</b> <b>tapping,</b> but girls with TS were superior to their healthy mates (p <. 001) in handgrip, sit-and-reach, and bent-arm hang.

40|$|Mature {{tree root}} {{systems can be}} {{categorised}} into three groups {{on the basis of}} their woody root architecture: heart, <b>tap</b> and <b>plate</b> systems. The lateral roots are important for transferring external loading forces into the ground, which helps maintain tree stability. In order to determine if the distribution of lateral root strength is related to the shape of the system and the forces withstood, wood samples were taken from roots of various mature tree species and the strength tested. Root strength decreased along the root at different rates, depending on the type of root system present. Lateral root in plate root systems were relatively stronger further away from the stem than laterals in heart and tap root systems. Wood strength in some species with plate systems was found to increase along the lateral roots, before decreasing again. It appears that the increase in strength coincides with the point of maximum bending of the root as the tree sways in the wind. Strength was also found to increase on the underside of lateral roots in the plate systems of poplar. The underside of these roots will experience high compression stresses due to the weight of the tree pushing the root onto the hard, bearing surface of the soil. External loading forces in plate root systems will be transmitted into the soil further away from the system due to the lack of branches, therefore a high strength along the root will help resist mechanical stress. The high rate of branching near the stem, or large rigid main tap root, found in heart and tap root systems, respectively, allows a faster dissipation of forces nearer the stem, therefore a high investment in strength further along the root is not necessary.

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: The study consisted of 462 boys and 393 girls who were aged 7 - 14 y. Measurements: Five body composition measures were assessed: BMI, SSF, %BF, FFM and WHR. Nine physical fitness test items were assessed: standing long jump, bent arm hang, sit-ups, 10 × 5 m shuttle run, 50 m sprint, 1600 m run, flamingo balance, sit and reach, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping.</b> Results: BMI was highly correlated with FFM (r= 0. 7, P< 0. 001). In line with findings from Western countries, regression coefficients (B) showed that children with higher BMI or SSF performed worse in bent arm hang (girls, B= - 0. 84, P< 0. 001, and B= - 0. 06, P= 0. 02, respectively) and in 1600 m run (B= 6. 68, P< 0. 001). BMI was significantly associated with flamingo balance(B= 0. 26, P= 0. 04). WHR was positively associated with bent arm hang (B= 9. 37, P= 0. 03), and inversely with sit and reach (B= - 7. 48, P= 0. 01). In contrast, significant relationships were found between BMI and standing long jump (B= 0. 74, P= 0. 04), sit and reach (B= 0. 51, P< 0. 001), flamingo balance (B= 0. 26, P= 0. 04) and <b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> (B= - 19, P= 0. 01). SSF was significantly associated with sit and reach (B= 0. 04, P= 0. 03). Significant inverse associations were found between FFM and bent arm hang (girls, B= - 0. 06, P= 0. 05), 1600 m run (girls, B= - 2. 33, P= 0. 003) and 50 m run (boys, B= - 0. 11, P= 0. 006). FFM was significantly associated with standing long jump (boys, B= 0. 99, P< 0. 001; girls, B= 0. 73, P< 0. 001), flamingo balance (B= 0. 17, P< 0. 001), and with sit and reach (boys, B= 0. 59, P= 0. 03). Conclusion: In the present study in undernourished children, body composition was significantly related to physical fitness, but not always in the expected direction. It is therefore important to note that in this population, BMI should not be interpreted as a measure of fatness/overweight, but rather as an indicator of muscle mass. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

The data were analyzed using a neural network approach. The results indicated that the school grades of middle school adolescents can be used to predict motor power. In this case, the linear correlation coefficient (r) between the actual and predicted data exceeded the level of r = 0. 9. In particular, a strong statistical impact of ecological, synthesis and physical skills on power performance was established. In contrast, a weaker correlation was observed with motor speed performance (r < 0. 6). More attention should be paid to the possible relationship between school grades and motor skills in children and adolescents.

In this study, AF and SF were examined simultaneously in relationship with domains of EF in children with ID or BIF. Seventy-three children (age range 8 - 11; 51 boys) with ID (IQrange 56 - 79) or BIF (IQrange 71 - 79) were measured annually {{over a period of}} 4 years on AF (20 -m endurance shuttle run test) and SF (<b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> and 10 x 5 m run). EF was measured with the Stroop Color-Word test (inhibition), Trailmaking and Fluency test (cognitive flexibility), Self-ordered pointing task (working memory) and the Tower of London (planning). Multilevel models showed that SF was significantly associated with inhibition and both measures of cognitive flexibility, but in the same models no significant associations between AF and EF were found. In addition, age was significantly related to working memory and cognitive flexibility, favouring the older children. In children with ID or BIF, SF is of greater importance than AF in relationship with core domains of EF. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Currently {{little is known about}} the fitness performance and its association with blood lipid profile in adolescents from low and middle income countries. We assessed if differences in physical fitness performance explained differences in blood lipid profile among urban and rural Ecuadorian adolescents. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2008 and April 2009 in 648 Ecuadorian adolescents (52. 3 % males) aged 11 to 15 years old attending secondary schools in Cuenca (urban n= 490) and Nabón (rural n= 158). Data collection included anthropometric measures, application of the EUROFIT battery and blood samples in a subsample (n= 301). RESULT(S) : According to FINESGRAM standard, 59 % of the adolescents exhibit unhealthy levels of physical fitness. Urban adolescents had significantly better levels of triglycerides and HDL-c as well as significantly higher mean scores in five EUROFIT items (20 m shuttle, speed shuttle run, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> and vertical jump) than rural adolescents. The associations of blood lipid profile with EUROFIT items were not different among urban and rural adolescents.

Physical fitness was assessed using eight tests from the Eurofit battery of tests: the single-leg balance test - {{for the assessment of}} general balance, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> - for the assessment of speed of movement, sit-and-reach - for the assessment of flexibility, the standing broad jump - for the assessment of explosive strength, the handgrip test - for the assessment of static strength, sit-ups - for the assessment of repetitive trunk strength, the bent arm hang - for the assessment of muscular endurance and the 10 x 5 meter shuttle run - for the assessment of the speed/agility. Cardiorespiratory endurance was estimated with the aid of 20 m endurance shuttle-run test. Based on the level of cardiorespiratory endurance, the participants in each subsample, were divided into three groups using a cluster analysis: high (VKRI), average (PKRI) and low level (NKRI). The physical fitness differences of students with different cardiorespiratory endurance levels were calculated using the one-way analysis of variance.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the tracking in physical fitness (PF) {{viewed as a}} whole, a multidimensional trait of the subject, and to establish the stability of each factor of PF in adolescence {{from the perspective of}} a panel study using the structural equation modeling approach. METHODS: From a sample of 454 boys followed from 12 to 18 yr of age of the Leuven Growth Study, we considered only three consecutive measurement occasions with a mean age of 12. 76, 14. 69, and 17. 73 yr. Physical fitness was evaluated by means of a battery composed of the following tests: <b>plate</b> <b>tapping,</b> sit and reach, vertical jump, arm pull, leg lifts, bent arm hang, and shuttle run. Structural equation models were fitted to the data, namely autoregressive models with latent variables. These models were used to quantify the tracking of PF as a whole and also of the individual marker variables of fitness. RESULTS: Stability estimates of PF as a whole are rather high, beta 21 = 0. 86 and beta 32 = 0. 68, with an explained variance of 74 % and 73 %, respectively. Tracking coefficients represented by disattenuated autocorrelations among the fitness factor gave high results: r 1, 2 = 0. 86; r 1, 3 = 0. 78; and r 2, 3 = 0. 85. CONCLUSIONS: Physical fitness as a whole is highly stable in adolescent years and very predictable from early years. The same is observed for each factor of fitness. Moreover, autoregressive models within the context of structural equation modeling are better suited than simple Pearson or Spearman autocorrelations to study the tracking problem of PF. status: publishe...|$|R

At follow-up, children in group C gained significantly more weight than children in the EGs and scored significantly less than the children in the EGs in the following assessments: counter movement jump (C:+ 0. 15 % vs. A:+ 4. 1 % and B:+ 6. 99 %), <b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> (C:+ 13. 56 % vs. A:+ 19. 37 % and B:+ 36. 12 %), sit-and-reach (C:− 311. 15 % vs. B:+ 409. 57 %), pinch strength (C:+ 2. 39 % vs. B:+ 10. 83, on average) and sit-up (C:+ 29. 69 % vs. A:+ 72. 61 %). In conclusion, specialist-led pupils demonstrated greater increases in some motor and health-related abilities tests compared to generalist-led peers, while different strength training devices produced comparable increases of strength in both EGs...|$|R
40|$|This {{photograph}} originally {{appeared in}} the 2013 Research student photography and image competition held to celebrate National Science Week (Aug 10 - 18). Blurb: Research Topic: Emotions in EEG. The inner workings of your brain could be likened to a mail sorting room. Information comes in and is sorted into its components, then integrated with prior experiences to form understanding and directing our ultimate response. This takes communication between billions of neurons, all working harmoniously to provide our cognitive abilities. Now imagine observing this sorting room, and watching the flurry of activity. Patterns start to emerge. When {{we have a lot}} of information, the activity is greater, and when resting so too does the brain. Emotional integration even: positive emotions processed on the left, negative emotions processed on the right. Electroencephalography or EEG enables us to image this brain activity from the outside, and with advanced technology in wireless sensing, we can measure EEG as we move around. The 2009 art project Staalhemel (Steel Sky) by Christoph De Boeck together with imec, used these brain waves to image the brain and project them onto the steel plates hanging in the sky. Each plate has a pin which <b>taps</b> on the <b>plate</b> at a frequency and strength guided by the brain activity. By wearing a wireless EEG headset (with dry electrodes so we don’t need extra gel in our hair) while walking under the plates, one can literally listen to their brain waves as if they were standing inside their brain. The wireless EEG headset is developed as part of my work at imec, and is also used in my research on brain activity during emotions...|$|R

Experiments were split into five days. Five different sets in total have been evaluated during the experiments with the following loads – 1, 7 kg (light clothing mode), 11, 0 kg (light armour mode), 20, 2 kg (heavy armour mode), 19, 6 kg (heavy armour mode without combat jacket), 11, 8 kg (backpack mode). Six NAF soldiers {{were involved in the}} experiments. Results of the experiments show up to 43 % of muscular endurance decrease, cardiorespiratory endurance decreased by 35 %, trunk strength decreased by 22 %, explosive leg power decreased by 26 %, flexibility was lost to an amount of 18 %, sweating during maximum load increased by 47 %, with the combat jacket removed sweating was decreased by 29 %. The Harvard step testing results identify the adaptation of the muscle groups to the specific load type and did not show significant changes in strength. The 10 × 5 m shuttle run (running speed and agility) demonstrated the high quality of the light armour load mode 18 : 16 sec. (1. 7 kg) versus 18 : 30 sec. (11. 0 kg), meaning a high level of modularity of the CIPS. The Flamingo balance test, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> (speed of limb movement) and the handgrip test (static arm strength) showed no influence of the CIPS onto the soldiers’ physical conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-fold}} {{approach was}} used to investigate the association between fatness and fitness of girls 7 to 17 years of age: first, age-specific correlations between fatness and measures of health-related and motor fitness, and second, comparisons of fitness levels of girls classified as fat and lean. A representative sample of 6700 between 7 to 17 years was surveyed. Adiposity (fatness) was estimated as the sum of five skinfolds (biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac, medial calf). Physical fitness included health-related items (step test, PWC 170, the sit and reach, sit-ups and leg lifts, flexed arm hang) and motor performance items (standing long jump, vertical jump, arm pull strength, flamingo stand, shuttle run, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping).</b> Age-specific partial correlations between fatness and each fitness item, controlling for stature and weight, were calculated. In addition, in each age group the fattest 5 % (presumably the obese) and the leanest 5 % were compared on each fitness test. After controlling for stature and weight, subcutaneous fatness accounts for variable percentages {{of the variance in}} each fitness item. Estimates for health-related fitness items are: cardiorespiratory endurance-step test (3 % to 5 %) and PWC 170 (0 % to 16 %), flexibility-sit and reach (3 % to 8 %), functional strength-flexed arm hand (6 % to 17 %) and abdominal strength-sit-ups/leg lifts (1 % to 8 %). Corresponding estimates for motor fitness items are more variable: speed of limb movement-plate tapping (0 % to 3 %), balance-flamingo stand (0 % to 5 %), speed and agility-shuttle run (2 % to 12 %), static strength-arm pull (4 % to 12 %), explosive strength-standing long jump/vertical jump (11 % to 18 %). At the extremes, the fattest girls have generally poorer levels of health-related and motor fitness. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{stability of}} physical fitness and physical activity from adolescence into middle adulthood in Flemish females. METHODS: Within {{the scope of the}} Leuven Longitudinal Study on Lifestyle, Fitness and Health, 138 females (mean age= 16. 6 +/- 1. 1 yr) from the Leuven Growth Study of Flemish Girls were seen in adulthood (mean age= 40. 5 +/- 1. 1 yr). Several body dimensions and motor fitness tests were taken. Physical activity was assessed by means of a sports participation inventory. Inter-age correlations were calculated between adolescent and adult values. Cross-tabulation was used to identify the percentage of subjects remaining in the same BMI and physical activity group or shifting from one group to another from adolescence to adulthood. Odds ratios for less activity and overweight in adulthood according to adolescent activity or weight status were calculated. RESULTS: Except for flamingo balance, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping,</b> leg lifts, and arm pull, all anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics were stable from adolescence to adulthood (r ranging from 0. 49 to 0. 96). Sports participation was not a stable characteristic (r= 0. 13). From adolescence to adulthood, 84. 5 and 63. 6 %, respectively, remained in the normal-weight and overweight group, whereas 62. 5 and 54. 4 %, respectively, remained in the less active and active group. The odds of being overweight in adulthood was 9. 53 (95 % CI: 3. 1 - 29. 8) times greater in overweight compared with normal-weight adolescent girls. CONCLUSION: In Flemish females, anthropometric and fitness characteristics demonstrate higher levels of stability from adolescence to middle adulthood than physical activity. Weight status during adolescence is indicative of adult weight status, and a pattern of less activity rather than activity tends to continue from youth to adulthood. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background Physical fitness {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a marker for health during adolescence. Currently, {{little is known about}} physical fitness and its association with blood lipid profile in adolescents from low and middle-income countries. The aim of this study is therefore to assess physical fitness among urban and rural adolescents and its associations with blood lipid profile in a middle-income country. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2008 and April 2009 in 648 Ecuadorian adolescents (52. 3 % boys), aged 11 to 15 years, attending secondary schools in Cuenca (urban n?=? 490) and Nabón (rural n?=? 158). Data collection included anthropometric measures, application of the EUROFIT battery, dietary intake (2 -day 24 h recall), socio-demographic characteristics, and blood samples from a subsample (n?=? 301). The FITNESGRAM standards were used to evaluate fitness. The associations of fitness and residential location with blood lipid profile were assessed by linear and logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors. Results The majority (59 %) of the adolescents exhibited low levels of aerobic capacity as defined by the FITNESSGRAM standards. Urban adolescents had significantly higher mean scores in five EUROFIT tests (20 m shuttle, speed shuttle run, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping,</b> sit-up and vertical jump) and significantly most favorable improved plasma lipid profile (triglycerides and HDL) as compared to rural adolescents. There was a weak association between blood lipid profile and physical fitness in both urban and rural adolescents, even after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions Physical fitness, in our sample of Ecuadorian adolescents, was generally poor. Urban adolescents had better physical fitness and blood lipid profiles than rural adolescents. The differences in fitness did not explain those in blood lipid profile between urban and rural adolescents. Cuencano. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{assessed}} if a school-based intervention improved physical activity, {{fitness and}} sedentary behavior among Ecuadorian adolescents. Methods: The ACTIVITAL program promoted {{physical activity and}} the reduction of sedentary behavior (mainly screen time) through 15 school classes and awareness raising activities (e;g. walking trail) in 11 to 15 years old adolescents. Ten schools were randomly allocated to the intervention and ten schools were pair matched as controls. Fitness measures (EUROFIT battery) and self-reported sedentary behavior were collected at baseline and after 28 months. Accelerometer data were collected during five weekdays in a random subsample (n= 224). The differences between intervention and control group were analyzed using mixed models considering the pair-matched design. We present tentative findings of the primary outcome measures. Results: After the intervention adolescents (n= 1440) from the intervention group had less decrease in accelerometer counts (P= 0. 32, β= 14695. 9), time spent in light (P= 0. 46, β= 1. 2) and moderate to vigorous activities (P= 0. 17, β= 9. 7) and a less increases {{of time spent in}} sedentary activities (P= 0. 04, β=- 43. 8) per day than control group. In addition, they showed an improvement in shuttle-short run (P= 0. 03, β=- 0. 8), <b>plate</b> <b>tapping</b> (P= 0. 10, β=- 0. 70), sit-and-reach (P= 0. 37, β= 0. 1), sit-ups (P= 0. 35, β= 0. 1), vertical jump (P= 0. 01, β= 2. 4), bent-arm-hang (P= 0. 12, β= 0. 9) and handgrip (P= 0. 22, β= 0. 4) tests. The screen time increased in both the intervention and control group (P= 0. 45, β= 0. 07) Conclusions: A school-based intervention can moderately improve physical activity and physical fitness in adolescents. The improvement is consistent for most physical activity and fitness parameters but did not reach significance for most outcomes possibly due to a power problem with pair-matched analyses...|$|R
40|$|Background: State school {{physical}} education (PE) programmes are common throughout Greece. However, {{it is not known}} if the main objectives of the Greek PE curriculum are achieved. Objective: To assess the current national PE curriculum in relation to selected motor and cardiovascular health related fitness parameters. Methods: A sample of 84 Greek schoolboys (mean (SD) age 13. 6 (0. 3) years, height 160. 7 (8. 6) cm, weight 50 (10. 8) kg) volunteered. Forty three indicated participation only in school PE classes and habitual free play (PE group). The remaining 41 were involved in extracurricular organised physical activities in addition to school PE and habitual free play (PE+ group). The subjects underwent anthropometric, motor (flexibility, balance, standing broad jump, hand grip, sit ups, and <b>plate</b> <b>tapping),</b> and cardiovascular health related (percentage body fat, aerobic fitness, and physical activity) fitness assessments. Results: Children in the PE group had inferior motor and cardiovascular health related fitness profiles compared with those in the PE+ group. Body fat (20. 3 (8. 8) Y 13. 9 (3. 5); p< 0. 001), aerobic fitness (34. 7 (3. 7) Y 43. 9 (4. 2); p< 0. 001), and time spent in intensive physical activity (0. 2 (0. 2) Y 0. 7 (0. 3);. 001) showed the greatest differences between the two groups. In the pupils in the PE group, these were lower than the levels proposed to be necessary to combat future health risks. Adjustments for confounding variables showed a decrease in the significance of motor fitness, but not in cardiovascular health related parameters. Conclusions: The national PE curriculum for Greek secondary schools does not achieve the required levels of motor and cardiovascular health related fitness and should be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{physical}} fitness and physical activity of 8 -year-old overweight children (n = 53) to normal weight children (n = 65), and {{to determine whether a}} significant relationship exists between physical activity of parents and their children. Study design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 119 children from Northern Finland were recruited for the study. Waist circumference, height, weight and BMI were measured. Physical activity of the children and their parents was determined with self-administered 7 -day recall questionnaires (PAQ-C). Physical fitness of the children was evaluated with 7 items of the EUROFIT-test battery (flamingo balance test, <b>plate</b> <b>tapping,</b> sit-and-reach test, sit-ups, bent arm hang and 10 &#x 00 D 7; 5 shuttle run). Aerobic capacity of the children was tested with 6 -minute walking test. Results: Overweigh was related to impaired performance in tests requiring muscle endurance, balance, explosive power of lower extremities, upper body strength and endurance, speed and agility in both genders and aerobic capacity in boys. Physical activity levels of overweight boys (2. 41 SD 0. 72) were lower than their lean counterparts (2. 91 SD 0. 64, p = 0. 004); no such difference was observed in girls (2. 53 SD 0. 64 vs. 2. 59 SD 0. 68, p = 0. 741). Physical activity was significantly associated with better performance in several physical fitness tests in boys, but not in girls. Mothers&#x 2019; physical activity was associated with children&#x 0027;s physical activity (r = 0. 363, p &# 60; 0. 001), but no such association was found between fathers and children (r = 0. 019, p = 0. 864). Conclusion: This study shows an inverse relationship between excess bodyweight and physical fitness in children. Mother-child relationship of physical activity appeared to be stronger than father-child relationship. Improving physical fitness in children through physical activity might require interventions that are responsive to the ability and needs of overweight children and their families and focus on helping parents and children to be physically active together...|$|R
