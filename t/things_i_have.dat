25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E

Berni continued corresponding with Aragon after leaving France, later recalling, [...] "It is a pity that I have lost, among the many <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost, the letters that I received from Aragon all the way from France; if I had them today, I think, they would be magnificent documents; because in that correspondence we discussed topics such as the direct relationship between politics and culture, the responsibilities of the artist and the intellectual society, the problems of culture in colonial countries, the issue of freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1824, Irving {{published}} {{the collection of}} essays Tales of a Traveller—including the short story [...] "The Devil and Tom Walker"—under his Geoffrey Crayon persona. [...] "I think there are in it {{some of the best}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever written", Irving told his sister. But while the book sold respectably, Traveller was dismissed by critics, who panned both Traveller and its author. [...] "The public have been led to expect better things", wrote the United States Literary Gazette, while the New-York Mirror pronounced Irving [...] "overrated". Hurt and depressed by the book's reception, Irving retreated to Paris where he spent the next year worrying about finances and scribbling down ideas for projects that never materialized.|$|E

Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity.

500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better... I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. It sucks, but it's one of those <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no control over... At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that he likes it more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] {{was written}} by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Björk: Wow and Flutter, Madonna was {{inspired}} at that time by Björk's second studio album, Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna {{got in touch with}} Björk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Björk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious", with the opening lyrics [...] "Today is the last day, That I'm using words"—the lines being born out of Björk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, [...] "When I was offered to write a song for , I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided to do this to write the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always wanted to hear her say that she's never said." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of things that have happened to me and <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the {{portrait}} of Johnny Marco, saying [...] "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
