5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul line {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished <b>the</b> <b>feat</b> for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished <b>the</b> <b>feat</b> on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Feats</b> of Strength are {{the final}} {{tradition}} {{observed in the}} celebration of Festivus, celebrated immediately following (or {{in the case of}} [...] "The Strike", during) the Festivus dinner. The head of the household selects one person at the Festivus celebration and challenges them to a wrestling match. Tradition states Festivus is not over until the head of the household is pinned. In [...] "The Strike", however, Kramer manages to circumvent the rule by creating an excuse to leave. <b>The</b> <b>Feats</b> of Strength are mentioned twice in the episode before they take place. In both instances, no detail was given as to what had happened, but in both instances, George Costanza ran out of the coffee shop in a mad panic, implying he had bad experiences with <b>the</b> <b>Feats</b> of Strength in the past. What <b>the</b> <b>Feats</b> of Strength entailed was revealed {{at the very end of}} the episode, when it took place. Failing to pin the head of the household results in Festivus continuing until such requirement is met.|$|R

Among the most important attributed to Shiva is the Shiva Purana, which describes in various stories the mythological origins of puja implements and taboos. An example might be the taboo of offering Magnolia champaca and Ketaki flowers to Shiva, each given a justification grounded in an episode from mythology.|$|R
