40|$|Summary: Using two new immunoradiometric assays for thyrotropin, we {{measured}} thyrotropin levels in serum of patients suffering from various clinically and biochemically diagnosed thyroid disorders, and in healthy controls. A <b>thyroliberin</b> Stimulation test {{was performed in}} all patients and controls. Thyrotropin levels were measured using a solid phase IRMA in 339 patients and a coated tube sandwich assay in 152 patients. The lower limits of detection of 0. 1 mU/ 1 (solid phase IRMA) and 0. 02 mU/ 1 (coated tube sandwich assay) äs well äs the specificity of these two assays were superior to those of conventional thyrotropin assays. Basal thyrotropin values were clearly different between euthyroid controls and patients non responding to <b>thyroliberin</b> Stimulation. However, the values for these two groups overlapped those for patients showing a subnormal increase upon Stimulation with <b>thyroliberin.</b> The <b>thyroliberin</b> Stimulation test in patients with autonomous adenomas, together with the measurement of thyrotropin using these sensitive assays, provides additional Information in the low ränge below 1. 0 mU/ 1, i. e. below the lower limit of detection of conventional double antibody radioimmunoassays.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, {{there has been an}} {{accumulation}} of evidence indicating that certain peptides that exert biological effects outside the CNS, may also possess neurotransmitter or neuromodulator functions in brain. <b>Thyroliberin</b> (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone) was the first of these such peptides displaying a dual role as a hormone and as a neurotransmitter. Its ubiquitous distribution in the hypothalamus and in the extra-hypothalamic regions, and its diverse pharmacological and physiological effects are all features of its dual functions. The study of brain peptidases that hydrolyse <b>thyroliberin</b> is of importance in securing an understanding of the possible mechanisms for termination of its neurotransmitter or neuromodulator actions and the possible enzymic biotransformation of the the original peptide to cleavage products that themselves may exhibit biological activity. The brain peptidases involved in the primary degradation of <b>thyroliberin</b> studied to date are three forms of pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (PAP), a cytosolic, particulate and serum form, and a cytosolic prolyl endopeptidase (PE) activity. This work studied the primary degradation of <b>thyroliberin</b> by the enzymes found in the particulate fraction of bovine brain. It began by investigating the methods available for the quantitation of the particulate PAP activity, and the development of two new assays for its detection, the first a coupled enzyme fluorimetric assay, and the second, a spontaneous cyclisation assay. Using these assays, PAP activity from the synaptosomal membranes of bovine brain was purified and characterised for the first time. This enzyme proved to have many of the characteristics of the previously studied particulate PAP activities, with some notable differences. The particulate PAP activity was shown to be 230 kDa in size, had a narrow substrate specificity, cleaving only <b>thyroliberin</b> or very closely related peptides, and displayed a high affinity for <b>thyroliberin.</b> It was inhibited by thiol protease inhibitors, had a requirement for DTT and was unaffected by EDTA. By combining these features, the particulate PAP from bovine brain appears to be a ‘hybrid’ form of the cytosolic and the particulate PAP activities previously studied. Prolyl endopeptidase is widely distributed, has a broad substrate specificty and has been previously characterised in the cytosolic fractions of many species. It is involved in the primary degradation of <b>thyroliberin,</b> producing the bioactive peptide, acid <b>thyroliberin.</b> Prior to this study, PE had only been characterised as a cytosolic activity, and despite references to the possibility of there being a particulate activity, it was never identified. PE activity was located on the synaptosomal membranes of bovine brain, and following vigorous salt-washing, osmotic shock and solubilisation with detergents, has been identified conclusively as a membraneassociated activity. It was purified from the synaptosomal membranes, and characterised as having a broad substrate specificity and a high affinity for <b>thyroliberin</b> (in fact a higher affinity than the particulate PAP). It was inhibited by some of the thiol protease inhibitors and some of the metal chelators, suggesting that it may be a thimet protease.

In Chapter 1 the electrolytic deprotection of π-phenacyl-thyroliberin is described: it was found to produce a complex mixture. This and otherdifficulties encountered by co-workers led to the conclusion that π-phenacyl was unsuitable for general use as a histidine protecting group. In Chapter 2, the investigation of the 1, 1,l-trichlorobut- 2 -enyl group for histidine protection is described. A model compound- NI(1, 1,l-trichlorobut- 2 -enyl) imidazole-was prepared and subjected to screening tests. A number of undesirable side-reactions including cis-trans isomerisation of the double bond were observed indicating {{that this is not a}} practical blocking group. A novel strategy of histidine protection involving reducing the basicity of the imidazole ring by temporary substitution with electronwithdrawing groups is outlined in Chapter 3. A new synthesis of N (α) -protected diiodohistidine derivatives and tests demonstrating their stability to routine conditions encountered in peptide synthesis and deprotection by hydrogenolysis are described. A synthesis of <b>thyroliberin</b> indicated the potential of this strategy. In Chapter 4 preparations of the corresponding 2, 5 -dibromoderivatives are described, and a solid phase synthesis of glycyl- L -histidyl- L -phenylalanine and a classical synthesis of <b>thyroliberin</b> are outlined. It was found however that although diiodination inhibited racemisation and dibromination was even more effective that direct blockade of the N (π) was indispensable for its complete prohibition.

In-terassay coefficient of variation (CV) with this procedure was 7. 9 % at 35 sg/L and 4. 8 % at 108 tgfL. The normal range for T 4 was 50 - 120 tg/L. We assessed the amount of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) by measuring [1251]T 3 binding by the patient’s serum, with use of talc as a separating reagent. The radioactivity in the TBG-bound fraction was counted and a ratio of standard normal pool serum and the patient’s sample was calculated. The normal range for this ratio was 0. 9 - 1. 18.

Using an extensive set of TRH analogs, we found no differences in TRH-R 1 and TRH-R 2 binding or in acute stimulation of signaling. TRH-R 2 was more rapidly internalized upon binding TRH and exhibited a greater level of TRH-induced down-regulation than TRH-R 1.

Application of TRH, which stimulates the release of prolactin and growth hormone from the GH 3 cell, elicited a transient hyperpolarization of the cell membrane followed by an enhancement of the generation of action potentials {{for an extended period}} in the majority of cells tested. The transient hyperpolarization was due to an increase of the membrane conductance to K+. The enhancement of the spike generation was not due to membrane depolarization. The input resistance of the cell membrane was found to be increased during the facilitation. Thus the mechanism of the facilitatory action of TRH is different from the mechanisms of conventional excitatory neurotransmitters. TRH enhances the spike generation, thus promoting Ca 2 + entry from extra- to intracellular space (the action potential of the GH 3 cell has a Ca 2 + component) and stimulating the release of hormones.

TRH caused an increase in low-Km GTPase activity in membrane-containing fractions from both control and pertussis-toxin-treated cells.

The toxin did not alter the increase in prolactin and growth-hormone (somatotropin) release stimulated by TRH or shift the TRH dose-response curve, and it did not affect the TRH-induced rise in prolactin synthesis measured over 24 h. However, pertussis toxin did block the ability of somatostatin and muscarinic agonists to inhibit prolactin and growth-hormone secretion stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide when analysed under the same conditions as those in which the TRH system was unaffected.

To examine further these possibilities, we have investigated the effect of TRH on the biosynthesis and degradation of PRL and GH RNA in a rat pituitary tumor cell line. Newly synthesized PRL and GH RNA sequences were quantified in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by hybridization of 3 H-labelled RNA to immobilized plasmid DNA containing either PRL or GH cDNA sequences. Steady-state levels of specific RNA were estimated by RNA blot hybridization.

In contrast, after a lag-time, TRH seems to induce a long-lasting inhibition on GH, as well as on overall gene transcription. Furthermore, we observed an effect of TRH on mRNA stability.

Observed ranges of plasma TSH-IRMA (milli-int. units/L) {{before and after}} TRH were: euthyroid (n = 20), 0. 2 - 3. 0 and 1. 7 - 15. 5; subclinically hypothyroid (n = 14), 4. 3 - 18. 5 and 20 - 75; hyperthyroid (n = 17), less than 0. 09 and less than 0. 09 - 0. 4; and subclinically hyperthyroid (n = 20), less than 0. 09 - 1. 1 and less than 0. 09 - 2. 6. Evidently TSH-IRMA results for a single sample completely distinguish hyperthyroidism from euthyroidism. However, TSH-IRMA values may also be undetectable in subclinical hyperthyroidism. The TSH response to TRH can be predicted from basal TSH-IRMA results less than 0. 09 or {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 8 milli-int. unit/L, intermediate values can be associated with either a normal TSH response (euthyroidism) or a decreased TSH response (subclinical hyperthyroidism only). We advocate TSH-IRMA as the first diagnostic test of thyroid function for amiodarone-treated patient...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of cyclic AMP in mediating regulatory peptide-controlled prolactin release from GH 3 pituitary tumour cells was investigated. Cholera toxin and forskolin elicited concentration-dependent increases in both GH 3 cell cyclic AMP content and prolactin release. The maximum rise in prolactin release with these agents was 2 -fold over basal. 8 -Bromo-cyclic AMP produced a similar stimulation of prolactin release. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine also produced {{an increase in}} prolactin release and GH 3 cell cyclic AMP content. However, {{the magnitude of the}} stimulated prolactin release exceeded that obtained with any other agent. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (<b>thyroliberin)</b> and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide produced a concentration-dependent rise in both cell cyclic AMP content and prolactin release. However, only vasoactive intestinal polypeptide elicited an increase in cell cyclic AMP content at concentrations relevant to the stimulation of prolactin release. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, when used in combination, were additive with respect to prolactin release. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and forskolin, at concentrations that were maximal upon prolactin release, were, when used in combination, synergistic upon GH 3 cell cyclic AMP content but were not additive upon prolactin release. In conclusion the evidence supports a role for cyclic AMP in the mediation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- but not thyrotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated prolactin release from GH 3 cells. A quantitative analysis indicates that a 50 - 100 % rise in cyclic AMP suffices to stimulate cyclic AMP-dependent prolactin release fully...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinically}} euthyroid 53 -year-old {{woman with}} an lgA-A-secreting multiple myeloma presented with increased serum concentrations of thyroid hormones. Laboratory studies revealed increased total thyroxine (T 4) and tn-iodothyronine (13) concentrations, a high-normal free T 4 concentration, and a normal basal thyrotropin (TSH) concentration with a normal response to <b>thyroliberin</b> (TRH). Her serum concentration of IgA was 11 040 mg/L (normal range 900 - 4500 mg/L) and immunoelectrophore-sis revealed it to be monoclonal. This monoclonal IgA bound both T 4 and T 3, as determined by serum immuno-electrophoresis and direct binding studies. Immunoelec-trophoresis {{in the presence of}} [1251114 or [1251]T 3 localized the radiolabeled iodothyronines to a band corresponding exactly to the precipitin arc of the monoclonal lgA. We performed direct binding studies with IgA purified by affinity chromatography with the lectinjacalin. PurifiedIgA (50 jig) bound both [125111 (12. 3 %) and [125111 (2. 7 %) specifically and in a dose-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of competitive-binding data utilizing [125 l]T 4 and unlabeled T 4 revealed a! (of 2. 2 x i 0 mol/L. The binding capacity for 14 was- 7 mol/L. Thus, in this case of IgA-secreting myeloma, the monoclonal IgA acts as an additional thyroid hormone-binding protein in serum that interferes in the 14 and T 3 AlAs. This is the first report of a monoclonal IgA producing an apparent euthyroid hyper-thyroxinemia.

Warren, 1982, J. Cell Biol. 92 : 92 - 107) have been applied to cultured rat prolactin (PRL) cells, either normal cells in primary cultures, or clonal GH 3 cells. In normal PRL cells, the A-RER stained the membranes of the perinuclear cisternae {{as well as those}} of many parallel RER cisternae. The A-Golgi stained part of the Golgi membranes. In the stacks it stained the medial saccules and, with a decreasing intensity, the saccules of the trans side, as well as, in some cells, a linear cisterna in the center of the Golgi zone. It also stained the membrane of many small vesicles as well as that of lysosomelike structures in all cells. In contrast, it never stained the secretory granule membrane, except at the level of very few segregating granules on the trans face of the Golgi zone. In GH 3 cells the A-RER stained the membrane of the perinuclear cisternae, as well as that of short discontinuous flat cisternae. The A-Golgi stained the same components of the Golgi zone as in normal PRL cells. In some cells of both types the A-Golgi also stained discontinuous patches on the plasma membrane and small vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane. Immunostaining of Golgi membranes revealed modifications of membrane flow in relation to either acute stimulation of PRL release by <b>thyroliberin</b> or inhibition of basal secretion by monensin...|$|E
40|$|The rat {{pituitary}} tumor derived {{cell lines}} of the "GH" family offer a fruitful model for studying the expressions of the prolactin (rPRL) and growth hormone (rGH) genes in basic and regulated states. In order to assess the potential role of DNA methylation in the basic expressions of rPRL and rGH genes we have used different cell strains which produce either high level of rPRL (GH 3 B 6 cells) or of rGH (GC cells) and minute amounts of both hormones (GH 3 CDL cells). The cleavage patterns generated by the methylation sensitive enzymes Hpa II and Msp I indicated an inverse correlation between the extent of gene methylation {{and the level of}} expression. However the use of 5 -azacytidine which decreases DNA methylation suggested a variable importance of gene methylation in the respective control of rPRL and rGH genes depending on the cell lines. In an other hand we attempted to elucidate some of the mechanisms by which <b>thyroliberin</b> (TRH) enhances rPRL gene transcription in GH 3 B 6 cells. Preliminary results indicated that the persistent occupancy of the TRH receptors was required to sustain at least for the first 5 hours the increased rate of rPRL gene transcription. In addition the possible relationship between the TRH-induced acute rPRL release and the stimulation of rPRL gene transcription was investigated. The results suggested that the activators of the C kinase-mediated pathway which are actually involved in the stimulation of the acute release were not sufficient alone for eliciting the maximum TRH response at the gene level.

40|$|Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; <b>thyroliberin)</b> stimulated rapid {{hydrolysis}} of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate [PtdIns(4, 5) P 2] by a phosphodiesterase (phospholipase C) in GH 3 cells, a prolactin-secreting rat pituitary tumour cell line. TRH {{caused a}} rapid {{decrease in the}} level of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 to 60 % of control and stimulated a marked transient increase in inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate, the unique product of phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2, to a peak of 410 % of control at 15 s. TRH also caused decreases in phosphatidylinositol 4 -monophosphate (PtdIns 4 P) and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) to 65 % and 93 % of control at 15 s respectively. Inositol 1, 4 -bisphosphate was increased to a peak of 450 % at 30 s; inositol 1 -monophosphate and inositol were not elevated until 30 s and 1 min respectively after TRH addition. To study whether PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis may be caused by an elevation in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, the changes induced by TRH in the levels of inositol sugars were compared with the effects of membrane depolarization by high extracellular [K+]. The elevation in cytosolic [Ca 2 +] induced by K+ depolarization did not change the level of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate. These data suggest that phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 may be the initial event in TRH stimulation of inositol lipid metabolism in GH 3 cells and that PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis is not stimulated by an elevation in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. The decreases in PtdIns 4 P and PtdIns may be due to enhanced conversion of PtdIns into PtdIns 4 P into PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 or to their direct hydrolysis by phosphomonoesterases and/or phosphodiesterases. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TRH-stimulated PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 breakdown causes Ca 2 + mobilization leading to prolactin secretion...|$|E
40|$|Prolactin-specific RNA (RNAPRL) {{in total}} nuclear RNA and in cytoplasmic poly(A) +RNA {{isolated}} from GH (rat pituitary) cells was selectively hybridized to immobilized cloned cDNAPRL. Agarose gel electrophoresis {{of the nuclear}} RNAPRL sequences eluted from the nitrocellulose filters revealed several RNA species of approximately 25 - 30, 18 - 19, and 12 - 13 S. Only the 12 - 13 S RNA species could be detected in the cytoplasmic poly(A) +RNA fraction. Comparative analysis of total nuclear RNA of control and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (<b>thyroliberin)</b> -treated cells by the reverse Southern blot technique demonstrated increased levels of all the nuclear RNAPRL species in hormone-treated cells. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAPRL sequences in control and treated cells were quantitated by molecular hybridization to cloned cDNAPRL. The 2 - to 3 -fold stimulation of PRL production by thyrotropin-releasing hormone-treated GH 4 C 1 cells could be correlated to the corresponding increase of nuclear RNAPRL sequences. The hybrid strain, which produces 1 / 5 th the amount of PRL that the parent GH 4 C 1 does, had 1 / 5 th the amounts of nuclear RNAPRL sequences. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone affected neither prolactin production nor nuclear RNAPRL level in 928 - 9 b cells. RNAPRL sequences could not be detected either in nuclei or in cytoplasm of prolactin nonproducing F 1 BGH 12 C 1 cells. However, prolactin production could be induced and RNAPRL sequences could be detected in the total nuclear RNA and in cytoplasmic poly(A) +RNA fraction after treatment of this GH cell substrain with 5 -bromodeoxyuridine. These results demonstrate that differential basal prolactin production and its modulation by thyrotropin-releasing hormone and by 5 -bromodeoxyuridine can be correlated to the altered levels of nuclear RNAPRL sequences in the three GH cell strains...|$|E
