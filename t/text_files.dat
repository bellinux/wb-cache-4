5|$|The Perl {{languages}} borrow features {{from other}} programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of <b>text</b> <b>files.</b> Perl 5 gained widespread {{popularity in the}} late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, {{in part due to}} its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of <b>text</b> <b>files</b> and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. <b>Text</b> <b>files</b> are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
40|$|A <b>text</b> <b>file</b> filter is {{a program}} that {{converts}} one <b>text</b> <b>file</b> into another {{on the basis of}} a set of rules. For statistical applications, a <b>text</b> <b>file</b> filter can convert data embedded in a complicated <b>text</b> <b>file</b> so that Stata can read and analyze it. A <b>text</b> <b>file</b> filter can also automate the production of more user-friendly output from long Stata log files. The file command lets you use <b>text</b> <b>file</b> filters in Stata. This article reviews some key programming points for successful implementation of such filters.

5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into <b>text</b> <b>files</b> that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E
