The main objective of fiscal harmonization process is the prevention ofdistortions of the competitive process and the attainment of an equitable allocation of financialresources between Member States. The aim is not to realize a uniform tax system for the MemberStates of the Union, but achieving a minimum level of harmonization of the national tax systems, inorder to prevent harmful fiscal competition between member States. The paper at hand presents themajor aspects of fiscal harmonization in general and some aspects of fiscal harmonization in thefield of value added tax (VAT) from an interdisciplinary perspective. The paper analyzes the majorlegal instruments used {{in the context of}} the harmonization process. It also refers to the mainobstacles in achieving the objective of harmonization, such as the rule of unanimity at the adoptionof measures at the Union level and proposes some solutions. The authors also try to explain why thedirectives are the mainly used legislative instruments in the context of harmonization process. Theultimate objective of the recent adopted EU tax rules in the field is the creation of a tax systembased on the principle of <b>taxation</b> <b>at</b> the <b>origin,</b> in order to reduce the administrative burden ontaxpayer and to prevent illegal capital movement between Member States. The final part of thepaper presents the major characteristics of the actual common system of VAT applicable in theEuropean Union and mentions some of the major obstacles in attaining the above mentionedobjective regarding the establishment of a more efficient tax system in the field of VAT. fiscal harmonization, EU tax policy, national tax systems, Value Added Tax (VAT), common VATsystem;...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: I study optimal {{capital and}} labor income {{taxation}} {{in a business}} cycle model with the recursive preferences of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990). In contrast {{to the case of}} timeadditive expected utility, I find that it is no longer optimal to make the welfare cost of distortionary taxes constant over states and dates. This dramatically alters standard taxation prescriptions: optimal policy calls for <b>taxation</b> <b>at</b> the intertemporal margin, variation of <b>taxation</b> <b>at</b> the intratemporal margin, and persistence of labor taxes independent of the stochastic properties of exogenous shocks. Ignoring the distinction between smoothing over time and smoothing over states is not an innocuous assumption for optimal policy...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays examining banks’ tax response. The first essay Tax vs. Regulation Policy and the Location of Financial Sector FDI is co-authored with Prof. Dr. Michael Overesch, Chair of Business <b>Taxation</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cologne and Prof. Dr. Georg Wamser, Chair of Public Finance at the University of Tuebingen. It aims to investigate how taxation and regulatory constraints influence German banks’ decision to locate branches orsubsidiaries in specific countries. In the second essay Profit Shifting and Tax Response of Multinational Banks, co-authored with Prof. Dr. Michael Overesch, Chair of Business <b>Taxation</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cologne, we evaluate if banks engage in profit shifting and estimate the extent. In additional analysis we test different profit components for their tax elasticity. Finally, we test often suspected shifting channels, such as leverage and loan loss provisions, to support our results. The thesis concludes with an essay on recapitalized banks. Tax Aggressiveness vs. Capital Injections - Can Banks Have It All? {{is based on a}} working paper with MSc. Tanja Herbert, doctoral research assistant at the chair of business <b>taxation</b> <b>at</b> the University of Cologne.
