5|$|A {{ridge to}} the north <b>turned</b> Gordon to the west-northwest, and by November 14 the cloud pattern resembled that of a {{subtropical}} cyclone, with little convection near and the strongest winds well-removed from the center. The storm paralleled the northern coast of Cuba and gradually developed convection near the center. On November15, the broad center crossed the Florida Keys near Key West. An approaching trough <b>turned</b> Gordon {{to the north}}east, bringing it ashore near Fort Myers, Florida on November 16 with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Gordon crossed the Florida peninsula in about nine hours, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach. As it reached the Gulf Stream, a small but intense area of convection developed over the center, and after the Hurricane Hunters reported flight-level winds in excess of 90mph (145km/h), Gordon attained hurricane status late on November17 about 245miles (345km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly thereafter, it reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the trough that had <b>turned</b> the hurricane to the north {{was replaced by a}} ridge. Gordon <b>turned</b> abruptly northwestward, and was briefly expected to cross the Outer Banks as a minimal hurricane. The hurricane <b>turned</b> to the south and south-southeast, weakening into a tropical storm due to stronger shear and drier air. On November19, the storm <b>turned</b> to the southwest and later to the west. Gordon weakened into a tropical depression before striking Florida again near Cape Canaveral on November20. It later <b>turned</b> to the north and dissipated over South Carolina on November21.|$|E

5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first noted {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Lesser Antilles on September 18.

40|$|Walking along {{a curved}} path {{requires}} coordinated motor {{actions of the}} entire body. Here, we investigate the relationship between head and trunk movements during walking. Previous {{studies have found that}} the head systematically <b>turns</b> into <b>turns</b> before the trunk does. This has been found to occur at a constant distance rather than at a constant time before a <b>turn.</b> We tested whether this anticipatory head behavior is spatially invariant for <b>turns</b> of different angles. Head and trunk positions and orientations were measured while participants walked around obstacles in 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° or 180 ° <b>turns.</b> The radius of the <b>turns</b> was either imposed or left free. We found that the head started to <b>turn</b> into the direction of the <b>turn</b> at a constant distance before the obstacle (~ 1. 1 m) for <b>turn</b> angles up to 135 °. During <b>turns,</b> the head was consistently oriented more into the direction of the <b>turn</b> than the trunk. This difference increased for larger <b>turning</b> angles and reached its maximum later in the <b>turn</b> for larger <b>turns.</b> Walking speeds decreased monotonically for increasing <b>turn</b> angles. Imposing fixed <b>turn</b> radii only affected {{the point at which the}} trunk started to <b>turn</b> into a <b>turn.</b> Our results support the view that anticipatory head movements during <b>turns</b> occur in order to gather advance visual information about the trajectory and potential obstacles...|$|R
