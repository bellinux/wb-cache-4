5|$|The Mayfair area {{is in the}} London Borough of Westminster and mainly {{consists}} of the historical estate of Grosvenor, along with the estates of Albemarle, Berkeley, Burlington, and Curzon. It is bordered on the west by Park Lane, north by Oxford Street, east by Regent Street, and the south by Piccadilly.

North of the Sabaneta range, the Prepo stream feeds into the Tusmare stream, which ends in the Guaire river.|$|E

5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Beer in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>is</b> usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was {{the hub of the}} temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|E

5|$|Æthelstan {{followed}} up his {{advances in the}} north by securing {{the recognition of the}} Welsh kings.

This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} heads north from the {{channels}} surrounding {{the west end}} of South Oyster Bay, it runs along {{the west side of the}} Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve and the Merrick Road Park Golf Course, both of which are separated from the Meadowbrook by a small creek. The golf course leads to nearby exitM9, a cloverleaf interchange with Merrick Road (unsigned County Route27 or CR27) in the Freeport section of Hempstead. Not far to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>is</b> exitM8, another cloverleaf serving NY27 (East Sunrise Highway). After crossing the adjacent Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, the parkway continues north across East Meadow Park to reach exitM7, a cloverleaf interchange with the Babylon Turnpike (unsigned CR7A). After exitM7, the Meadowbrook makes a slight turn to the northwest as it traverses Roosevelt Preserve County Park.|$|E
5|$|Between 1963 and 1975 {{significant}} {{portions of}} US6/SR14 {{were moved to}} a freeway alignment. The former routing south of Mojave (and the current routing to <b>the</b> <b>north)</b> <b>is</b> still known as Sierra Highway. The first freeway section, from just east of Solemint Junction to Red Rover Mine Road, was completed in 1963. Further portions in the intercanyon areas of Acton to Soledad Pass were completed by 1965. By 1966 the freeway was complete {{as far north as}} Avenue P-8 in Palmdale. The freeway was completed to Mojave by 1972.|$|E

5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>is</b> moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
5|$|In the ecclesiastical {{administration}} of the Church of England the entire North is covered by the Province of York, which {{is represented by the}} Archbishop of York – the second-highest figure in the Church after the Archbishop of Canterbury. The unusual situation of having two archbishops at the top of Church hierarchy suggests that Northern England was seen as a sui generis. Likewise, with the exception of parts of the Diocese of Shrewsbury and Diocese of Nottingham, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>is</b> covered in Roman Catholic Church administration by the Province of Liverpool, represented by the Archbishop of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|In the west, NY164 splits {{off from}} NY311 a short {{distance}} east of I-84. It crosses under the Metro North tracks three times, including two one-lane underpasses with limited sight to the other side. It passes along the northern base of a small mountain and turns slightly southward. The highway turns due eastward and intersects with County Route64 in the hamlet of Towners. Just to <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>is</b> Mandel Pond, and the route makes a series of erratic turns around small mountains, passing south of Cornwall Hill as it does so. NY164 turns south-southeast and ends at NY22 in Patterson, east of the East Branch Croton River.|$|E
