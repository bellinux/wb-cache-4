25|$|<b>Turbin</b> {{fought in}} Operation Bagration. On 24 June, he led his platoon into fortifications between the Dnieper and the Drut and {{attacked}} into the German trenches, reportedly personally killing 10 German soldiers. On 25 June, {{they continued to}} attack the fortifications. On 26 June, Turbin's platoon moved through the marshes and swam across the Drut. The platoon's attack reportedly took the German troops by surprise. The German troops were reportedly unable to initially offer serious resistance despite their numerical superiority. <b>Turbin</b> destroyed a heavy machine gun and 75mm artillery shells with a hand grenade. The German troops soon recovered from their surprise and made four counterattacks. These were repulsed by Turbin's platoon, which reportedly inflicted 200 casualties on the German troops. The platoon managed to hold the bridgehead until {{the rest of the}} regiment arrived. On 8 August, <b>Turbin</b> was killed during the attack on Białystok. He was buried in the village of Vilkowo near Bialystok. On 24 March 1945, he was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin.|$|E

25|$|Anthrax's lineup {{has changed}} {{several times over}} their career. The band has {{had a number of}} vocalists {{including}} Neil <b>Turbin,</b> Joey Belladonna, Dan Nelson and John Bush. Founding member Scott Ian and early arrival Charlie Benante, who joined Anthrax in 1983, are the only band members to appear on every album.

After briefly rejoining the band from 2005 to 2007, Belladonna returned to Anthrax once again in 2010, and the band has since recorded two more studio albums with him: Worship Music (2011) and For All Kings (2016).|$|E
50|$|The Days of the <b>Turbins,</b> {{directed}} by Stanislavsky, premiered on 5 October 1926. The first Soviet play portraying the White Army officers realistically, as not caricature villains, but likeable people, caused furore. In its first season, in 1926/1927 The Days of the <b>Turbins</b> ran for 108 performance, {{which was a}} record figure that year for Moscow theatres. Despite numerous attempts at obstructions, it became a huge a hit, especially with the non-party public. The Soviet press panned it, though, and as the time went by, {{the severity of the}} criticism increased. In April 1929 the MAT leadership succumbed to the pressure and the production was cancelled.|$|R

50|$|As {{the novel}} before it, the play {{had a strong}} autobiographical aspect to it. The {{description}} {{of the house of}} the <b>Turbins</b> corresponds to that of the house of the Bulgakov family in Kiev, now the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum.|$|R
25|$|The Utes {{won their}} home opener, beating rival Utah State for the 12th {{consecutive}} time, extending their winning streak to a best-in-the-nation 15 games including games from the 2008 and 2007 seasons. This {{was the first}} game for former Utah defensive coordinator, and new Utah State head coach, Gary Andersen. Junior college transfer Terrance Cain won in his debut at quarterback for the Utes, completing 20 of 30 attempts for 286 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, while running back Matt Asiata ran for a career-best 156 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and David Reed caught 10 passes for 172 yards. Utah State managed to force three turnovers, and running back Robert <b>Turbin</b> set a school record with a 96-yard touchdown run that accounted for {{nearly a third of the}} Aggies' offensive total for the game.|$|E
25|$|Noted for {{its live}} performances, Anthrax {{signed with the}} {{independent}} label Megaforce Records, which released the band's debut studio album in 1984. Lilker soon left the band to form Nuclear Assault, {{and was replaced by}} roadie Frank Bello. Lead vocalist Neil <b>Turbin</b> was replaced after two years by Matt Fallon, who was then subsequently replaced in 1984 by Joey Belladonna. With a new lineup, the band recorded Spreading the Disease (distributed by Island Records) in 1985. Anthrax's third album, Among the Living, was released in 1987 to critical praise. The band experienced another lineup change in 1992, when John Bush from Armored Saint replaced Belladonna as lead vocalist. Sound of White Noise was released the following year, peaking at number seven on the Billboard 200. Studio recordings during the 1990s saw the band, influenced by other genres, experimenting with its sound.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{sandstone}} rockshelfs and rock pools fringe the entire coastline and Port Hacking Estuary Line of the National Park broken on by small sandy beaches and gentle freshwater inlets. Some {{of the most}} commonly encountered molluscs in this habitat include black nerites (Nerita atramentosa), <b>turbin</b> snails (Turbo undulata), zebra snails (Austrocochlea porcata) as well as the commercially farmed Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata). One of the most common and distinctive seaweed species that grow among the rock pools and the nearshore rockshelfs is Neptunes necklace (Hormosira banksii) a seaweed made of small buoyant fleshy bead-like structures which resemble strongly that of a necklace. Beds of the primitive sea-squirt cunjevoi (Pyura stolonifera) are common along coastal rockshelfs which are covered by high tide and near sea spray. Considered the most beautiful and obvious of the Royal National Parks' sea anemone is the waratah anemone (Actinia tenebrosa) named after the waratah flower due to its corresponding flame red coloration. A common sea-star found growing in the rock pools is the biscuit sea star (Tosia australis).|$|E

5000|$|After {{the first}} two parts of The White Guard were {{published}} in Rossiya, Bulgakov was invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play The Days of the <b>Turbins.</b> This was produced at the Moscow Art Theatre, to great acclaim: ...|$|R
50|$|In April 1929 the {{production}} was cancelled. On 16 February 1932, {{due to the}} direct interference of Joseph Stalin, it was revived, and continued to run until June 1941. The Days of the <b>Turbins</b> had 987 runs {{in the course of}} these ten years.|$|R
500|$|Mustaine, {{who went}} on to found Megadeth, has {{expressed}} his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett [...] "stole" [...] his job. Mustaine was [...] "pissed off" [...] because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written. In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, [...] "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.1 guitarist in your magazine". On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song [...] "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled [...] "The Four Horsemen" [...] on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to [...] "straighten Metallica up" [...] because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar. Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace; the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil <b>Turbin.</b> This {{was the first time the}} two bands performed live together.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1984, Neil <b>Turbin</b> and Anthrax went their {{separate}} ways after long standing personal issues. In his book Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, music journalist Eddie Trunk admits pressuring Jon Zazula, Scott Ian and Anthrax into firing <b>Turbin</b> because of his personal taste in vocals. Singer Matt Fallon was briefly hired in late 1984, but he and the band soon parted ways. [...] The remaining members decided to play live shows as a four-piece billed as [...] "The Diseased" [...] with Scott Ian on vocals, performing hardcore punk covers until a permanent singer could be found.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Joey Belladonna {{was chosen}} as the new vocalist. The Armed and Dangerous EP marked Belladonna's {{recording}} debut even though it featured two live tracks from 1984 and the two songs from the [...] "Soldiers of Metal" [...] single that all had Neil <b>Turbin</b> performing on them.|$|E
5000|$|The Days of the <b>Turbins</b> was {{published}} {{for the first}} time in Russian in 1955, in Moscow, under Elena Bulgakova's personal supervision. Before that, in 1934, in Boston and New York City, it came out in English, translated by Y. Lyons and F. Bloch, respectively. Earlier, in 1927, its second version was translated into German by K. Rosenberg.|$|R
5000|$|Bulgakov sent Stalin {{some more}} letters; they {{remained}} unanswered, but on 16 February 1932, unexpectedly, {{the production of}} the Days of the <b>Turbins</b> was revived and the play re-entered the Moscow Art Theatre major repertoire. For Bulgakov this came as a surprise. [...] "For reasons unknown to me, which I am {{not in a position to}} speculate upon, the Soviet government issued an extraordinary order for the MAT to re-start the production of The Days of the <b>Turbins.</b> For the author of that play this means only one thing: the huge bulk of his life has been risen from the dead, simple as that," [...] Bulgakov wrote to his friend, the literary and philosophy historian Pavel Popov (1892-1964).It was obvious for both that this 'extraordinary' order could not have been issued by any one other that Stalin himself. Later it was revealed that the Soviet leader have seen the play at least fifteen times in the course of three years, often visiting the theatre incognito. Apparently, Stalin came to such a decision spontaneously, upon having returned from the Moscow Art Theatre disgusted with what he called 'a bad play', Alexander Afinogenov's Fear (tellingly, criticising the idea that the old intelligntsia should be integrated into the new Soviet society and, at that, quite popular with the party-controlled media), and impulsively decided that the 'good one', The Days of the <b>Turbins,</b> should be restored. His orders were promptly heeded.|$|R
50|$|The People's Artist of the USSR (1937), and a {{recipient}} of numerous high-profile state awards, including the Order of Lenin (1938) and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1837), he is best remembered for his parts in An Ardent Heart and The Storm by Alexander Ostrovsky (Narkis, Tikhon respectively), The Days of the <b>Turbins</b> (Mikhail Bulgakov, Myshlayevsky), Dead Souls (Nikolai Gogol, Nozdryov), The Cherry Orchard (Anton Chekhov, Lopakhin).|$|R
2500|$|Anthrax {{was formed}} in Queens, New York City, on July 18, 1981 by guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Lilker. The band was named after the disease {{of the same name}} which Ian saw in a biology textbook. The name was chosen because it sounded [...] "sufficiently evil". Anthrax's initial line-up was {{completed}} by singer John Connelly, drummer Dave Weiss and bassist Paul Kahn. Kahn was briefly replaced by bassist Kenny Kushner before Lilker took over on bass and Greg Walls joined as lead guitarist. Weiss was then replaced early on by Greg D'Angelo, who was recommended to the band by Greg Walls. Scott Ian's younger brother Jason Rosenfeld was a temporary vocalist until Ian's former schoolmate Neil <b>Turbin</b> joined the band in late August 1982. The band recorded its first demo tape during this time.|$|E
2500|$|For some women, like Hannah Tapfield King, plural {{marriage}} {{was a way}} for women to obtain the highest blessings of salvation. King's husband was {{not a member of}} the church, and although he did convert, the couple was not able to be sealed in the temple. King was sealed to Brigham Young but only for the next life. She remained married to her husband throughout her life and never had relations with Young, but was able to ensure blessings for herself through polygamy that she would not otherwise have received in this life. After accepting polygamy, Edith <b>Turbin</b> declared [...] "I had rather to be the 20th wife of an honorably God-fearing Man, than to be the only wife of any one of two thirds of the Men in the world." ...|$|E
