5|$|On February 29, 2012, Apple {{announced}} a media event scheduled for March 7, 2012, at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. <b>The</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not predisclose {{the subject of}} the event, but analysts widely expected the event to announce {{a new version of the}} iPad.

5|$|In May, 2011 {{more than}} 2,000 of the {{estimated}} 8,000 investors who lost money {{in the collapse of}} GSL took legal action seeking damages from Great Southern. They said <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not disclose the risks associated with managed investment schemes and the company's poor financial performance. The action also sought to question Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Javelin Asset Management and Great Southern Finance as to why they issued loans to investors in Great Southern.|$|E
5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject his game, as <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not really understand the concept at first. However, the games {{turned out to be}} a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E

5|$|Primarily {{because of}} its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console's {{popularity}} in North America. During October–December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by a two-to-one ratio, and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 {{percent of the market}} for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, {{this was the first time}} since December 1985 that <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not lead the console market.|$|E
5|$|Service was {{introduced}} on 11 June 2006, with a contract lasting ten years. Along {{with the change}} of operator and stock, the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who owns the stations and tracks, did an overhaul of maintenance {{on many of the}} stations, in particular removing years of vandalism. In August, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> a minor upgrade to the trains. The quiet sections were doubled from one to two sections, and new window shades for NOK 650,000 were purchased. By August, the ridership on the Gjøvik Line had increased by 8%, compared to the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not believe in it and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. In the end they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company.|$|E

5|$|Carte {{left the}} theatre, opera company, hotels {{and his other}} {{business}} interests to Helen. Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of Iolanthe and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, mining {{operations}} in Silver Reef resumed {{under the direction}} of Alex Colbath, who organized the area's mines into the Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Company. These mines were purchased by American Smelting and Refining Company in 1928, but <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> minimal work {{as a result of the}} Great Depression. The Western Gold & Uranium Corporation purchased Silver Reef's mines in 1948, and in 1951, they began mining uranium in the area. These operations did not last long either, and the Western Gold & Uranium Corporation sold their mines to the 5M Corporation in 1979. Today, the Wells Fargo office, the Cosmopolitan Restaurant, the Rice Building, and numerous foundations and walls remain in the town site, and a few dozen homes have been constructed in the area.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, the {{brothers}} started Ashby Computers and Graphics in the Leicestershire town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch with Lathbury and Tim's girlfriend, Carole Ward, whom he later married in 1985. They {{worked out of}} a four-room row house next-door to {{the brothers}}' family corner store and ran on a shoestring budget for its first six months, in which they pooled their {{money to pay the}} bills. <b>The</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not credit individuals on their releases, though they had individual roles in development: Chris and Lathbury programmed and Tim and Carole designed the graphics. Carole also served as the company's secretary. Ultimate Play the Game, as the company was publicly known, first licensed arcade cabinet conversion kits to companies before moving to the more profitable British home computer market.|$|E
5|$|In his own 2003 thesis, Lieutenant Colonel Victor J. Bond {{said the}} 2nd Ranger Company's {{performance}} in Korea had been exemplary, {{in spite of}} racial discrimination against it. The troops, who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company, quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers. Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea, noting <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also said many of the accomplishments of the company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2007, Odex {{director}} Stephen Sing {{announced on}} his company's Internet forum that Odex {{would no longer}} send letters of demand to Internet users who had stopped their illegal downloading {{since the beginning of}} the enforcement drive. Two weeks later, Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist emails intended for the alleged downloaders. <b>The</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not obtain subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their subscribers. Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{announcing his}} {{campaign}} for governor, Wolf submitted an inquiry to the Massachusetts Ethics Commission as a precaution {{there would be no}} conflict of interest. However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort. In a statement to supporters, explaining that departing his company or canceling contacts would put his employees' jobs at risk, he announced that he would suspend his campaign, and resign from the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{regarding}} the next-generation iPad emerged {{shortly after the}} release of the third-generation iPad. At that point some speculated that the next iPad released would be of a smaller size. Further speculations emerged in July 2012 when DigiTimes, with the help of unspecified sources, claimed that Apple made small revisions to the then upcoming iPad and scheduled its release for late 2012. On October 16, 2012, Apple announced a media event scheduled for October 23 at the California Theatre in San Jose, California. <b>The</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not pre-disclose the subject of the event, but it was widely expected to be {{regarding the}} iPad Mini. Photographic images of the device's dock connector and front camera emerged shortly before the media event.|$|E
5|$|Several ferries in the New York City {{area were}} {{affected}} when plans for NYC Ferry were made public. NY Waterway would give over its East River route to NYC Ferry. New York Water Taxi remained separate, but was to eliminate 200 jobs; it had stated {{that if it}} did not win the contract with the city to operate NYC Ferry, then it would shut down. Since <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not win the NYC Ferry contract, it had been expected to shut down in October 2016, but continued operations {{through the end of the}} year before being purchased by Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises in January 2017. The city-owned Staten Island Ferry remains a separate entity. In addition, the ferry service would add 155 jobs to the New York Harbor area.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} Alien vs. Predator {{originated}} from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989, and was hinted at when an Alien skull {{appeared in a}} trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2. Screenwriter Peter Briggs created the original spec screenplay in 1990–1991, {{which was based on}} the first comic series. In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on Alien Resurrection. A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer John Davis, who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not produce them quickly enough.|$|E
5|$|Start won the 2012 Norwegian First Division {{and were}} {{promoted}} to the top league for their 2013 season. Start Stadion {{had been involved in}} a legal suit with the Norwegian Tax Administration over whether value added tax was to be paid for the stadium's naming rights. The company lost the case both in Agder Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, resulting in the company having to pay NOK9 million in taxes. As <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>did</b> not have such values, it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013. At the time the company had a debt of NOK107 million. At the time the municipality has commenced negotiations with Sparebanken Sør to purchase the stadium. Football economist Tor Geir Kvinen stated that Sparebanken Sør had by then spent NOK200 million on subsidizing Start and that in reality the municipality and bank were funding the repeated deficits in the club. The municipality announced a plan in October 2013, whereby they would purchase the bank's NOK54 million loan for NOK44 million and receive all the shares in the stadium company. The bank would then buy the naming rights for ten more years for NOK10 million and yet unsold commercial property. The municipality would then be owed NOK64 million by the stadium company, up from NOK46 million.|$|E
