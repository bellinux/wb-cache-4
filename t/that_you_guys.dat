Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us.

We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl."

500|$|Hader, who had {{previously}} cameoed in Monsters University, was cast to voice Fear, a role that he felt he [...] "weaseled" [...] his way into by being a [...] "huge fan" [...] of Pixar's filmography. Hader toured the studio over a week, and also [...] "helped out" [...] in the story room. He was invited to play Fear {{by the end of}} his stay there, but was also asked to contact fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) veteran Amy Poehler, whom the team viewed as perfect for the character of Joy. [...] "They said: 'Would you mind calling Amy? We don't want to call her and have her think we're some weirdo,'" [...] he recalled. He phoned Poehler and explained the story to her, noting that her role would be the driving force in the film. When the story was pitched to Kaling, she broke down in tears, explaining [...] "I just think it's really beautiful <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> are making a story that tells kids that it's difficult to grow up and it's OK to be sad about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, a {{separate}} American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version {{would be set}} in an unfortunate fishing village in New England. American actor John Michael Higgins was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show's religious themes: [...] "The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don't have that in our country, we're frightened of it. It's basically <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> are doing an Irish joke also, we don't have that.

The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well.

I thought when Tempus Irae came out it was great, but it was the same old monotonous textures and architecture over and over. With EMR I get to play in the stone age, medieval times, and in futuristic cities. Your city landscapes have to be the most convincing ones I've ever seen.

5000|$|... "I {{was finally}} able to finish it for these discs; {{this is the first time}} ever that it's going to be seen in its proper form. It's a really gory and crazy little movie, done in the style of Dario Argento/Mario Bava/color-saturated horror. You guys {{actually}} saw it back in the days of Starlog; I sent it in to the final Cinemagic contest by that long-defunct magazine, and you sent me back a handwritten letter saying <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> had liked it.

5000|$|... "For {{those of}} you who are curious as to what our [...] "legal issues" [...] were that halted the {{production}} of Dingir, and pushed its official release date from Nov. 20th, 2012 to Feb 5th, 2013, we are able to explain them now. A third party was legally fighting us for the rights to our name using a loop hole method that renders the protection of our copyright obsolete in that specific circumstance. After butt loads of money was dropped in attorney and legal fees, we were able to keep our name as well as take precautions to ensure that this sort of thing never happens to us again. During this time, someone leaked an unfinished, poor quality pre-production version of our album months before our new release date. In light of the album being pushed back, and the leak, we decided to just stream the entire high quality finished version of the album on Youtube for everyone, as well as make it available for download, and put up the guitar tabs on ultimate-guitar.com for people who were interested in learning our songs. We know you guys had been waiting for the album long enough, and we would rather have you all jam out to the high quality finished album, then a poor quality unfinished product. This third party that was trying to steal our name away from us, and got our albums release date pushed back will not be named, because we know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> will go absolutely apeshit on them for doing that to us. We have full trust <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> will support the band and still pick up a copy of Dingir when our album drops on Feb. 5th, 2013 so that we can hit the road again on tour, and hang out, and play for all of you guys! We are currently working on pre-order packages, a music video, and something else special for everyone that we will be releasing starting on our album's original release date of Nov. 20th, 2012!" ...|$|E

I think it's great <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> voted Linden as Best Newcomer and that he has been well received but I guess the fact he has a fan base is down to Tony McHale, Diana Kyle and the writing team coming up with such an interesting character and Tony, Diana, Liz Stoll and Julia Crampsie for giving me the opportunity to play him".
