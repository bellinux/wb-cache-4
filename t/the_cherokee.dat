5|$|In 1760, British {{relations}} with <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee,</b> {{which had been}} moderately friendly for several decades, grew sour after several Cherokee chiefs were imprisoned and killed in South Carolina. In early 1760, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> laid siege to Fort Loudoun, a remote outpost {{in what is now}} Tennessee. The garrison held out until August of that year, but was forced to surrender due to lack of provisions. A relief column under Archibald Montgomerie failed to reach the fort after burning <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Lower Towns and being stopped at the Battle of Echoee. In spite of the garrison leaving the fort under a flag of truce, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> killed 22 of its members on their march home in retaliation for the colonists' earlier killing of 22 Cherokee held as prisoners at Fort Prince George (South Carolina).|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1764, five Cherokee visited Timberlake, seeking an {{audience}} with the governor of Virginia and requesting passage to London. <b>The</b> <b>Cherokee</b> wished to appeal to King George to enforce the Proclamation Line of 1763, which restricted colonists to east of the Appalachians, due to continuing encroachment by white settlers on Cherokee land. The governor denied their request, but Timberlake agreed to help them. He accompanied three Cherokee to London {{in the fall of}} 1764. Not long after their arrival, the benefactor of the trip fell ill and died. Lord Halifax refused to grant <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> an audience, as the trip was unauthorized. Timberlake was accused of attempting to profit off the public attention given to <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee.</b> The government sent <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> back to North America in March 1765. Shortly after their departure, Timberlake was arrested for failing to pay the debt for the last bill for lodging of himself and <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee.</b> He likely wrote his Memoirs while incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Seven Years' War, Euro-American {{settlers}} began trickling into east Tennessee from the eastern colonies. In 1772, several pioneers negotiated a lease for Cherokee lands in northeast Tennessee and formed the Watauga Settlement. In spite of the agreement, tensions between the pioneers and <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> rose steadily. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> were allied with the British against the rebellious American colonies, hoping to push the encroaching settlers out of their territory.|$|E

5|$|The first {{interchange}} on <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Turnpike is with SH-82 in Locust Grove. The turnpike continues east, passing into Delaware County, {{to intersect}} US-412 Alternate again between Rose and Leach. East of this interchange, a service area {{lies in the}} median of the roadway; east of there, the highway passes through <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Turnpike's only mainline toll plaza. The turnpike's final interchange is with US-59 and SH-10 in Kansas. <b>The</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Turnpike then ends, merging with US-59; at this junction, US-412 Alternate, which was concurrent with US-59, also ends. US-59 and US-412 continue southeast through Flint, before turning due east to West Siloam Springs. There, US-59 splits away from US-412, while US-412 remains on an easterly trajectory, crossing the state line into Siloam Springs, Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|Following Dunmore's War, Richard Henderson, a {{prominent}} judge from North Carolina, hired Boone {{to travel to}} <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> towns in present North Carolina and Tennessee and inform them of an upcoming meeting. In the 1775 treaty, Henderson purchased <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> claim to Kentucky to establish a colony called Transylvania. Afterwards, Henderson hired Boone to blaze {{what became known as}} the Wilderness Road, which went through the Cumberland Gap and into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about 30 workers, Boone marked a path to the Kentucky River, where he founded Boonesborough. Other settlements, notably Harrodsburg, were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone returned to the Clinch Valley and brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-eighteenth century, Morgan's grandson, John Black, and his Mohawk friend Kanyenke are {{on their}} way through the Carolinas to Brunswick with their band of mercenaries after being called for by the colony's governor, John's uncle, Stuart Black. After {{defending}} the colony against Cherokee raiders, John and Kanyenke attack <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> war camps, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> to arrange a peace settlement. But while John, Kanyenke, and most of the colony's garrison are away at the negotiations both they and Brunswick are attacked by a British army under General Warwick, who capture the town. Warwick captures Stuart and begins questioning him about the location of the Lake of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Maldonado {{filed suit}} in the South Carolina U.S. District Court on July 24, 2013, asking that the ICWA be {{declared}} unconstitutional. On July 31, 2013, the Capobiancos legally adopted the child. Concurrently with the South Carolina court finalizing the adoption, the Native American Rights Fund filed a civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court {{on behalf of the}} child, alleging that her rights had been violated by the South Carolina court. In addition, a South Carolina court order cannot be enforced in Oklahoma without the agreement of an Oklahoma court, and Brown stated that he would fight the order in Oklahoma, with the aid of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation. Prior to the South Carolina adoption being finalized, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation District Court granted temporary guardianship to Brown's wife and parents while Brown was in military training out of state. At the same time, a judge in South Carolina ordered Brown to immediately turn over the child to the Capobiancos, which representatives of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation said was impossible while Brown was performing his military duties.|$|E

5|$|The elder Hindman {{frequently}} made {{business trips}} to Alabama and even moved {{the family to}} Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He {{took advantage of the}} many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation. The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation, and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.|$|E
5|$|During and {{following}} the American Revolutionary War, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the westward thrust of Euro-American settlement led to {{the decline of the}} Overhill towns. <b>The</b> <b>Cherokee</b> were forced to cede most of their lands in this area through a series of unfavorable treaties with the United States, and they migrated to the south and west away from settler pressure for a time.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Archaic period {{regional}} {{variation in}} point forms {{is seen in}} Iowa, and Indians adapted to more localized forms of hunting and gathering while probably maintaining seasonal movements from camp to camp.

5|$|The English {{language}} has been {{official in the}} state of Oklahoma since 2010. The variety of North American English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is quite diverse with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland, and Southern dialects.
