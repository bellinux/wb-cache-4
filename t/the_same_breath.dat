30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the personalized APRV (P-APRV) used to set time-controlled PEEP [109, 110] and inverse inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio are not at all <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mechanical <b>breath.</b> Although there are many differences between P-APRV and inverse I:E, I will focus on the large difference in the time at expiration between these two ventilation strategies. It was shown by Neumann et al. that the ARDS lung collapses very rapidly, their data showing collapse in 0.6  s after the initiation of expiration [17]. Our work using direct observation of alveoli during mechanical ventilation has also shown a very rapid alveolar collapse in the ARDS lung [40, 111 – 113]. Unlike APRV, inverse ratio ventilation does not allow direct and independent adjustments of the expiratory and inspiratory times. Thus, if the expiratory duration with inverse I:E is not less than 0.4 – 0.6  s, which is most often the case, alveoli would have sufficient time to collapse with each breath and inverse I:E would not be defined as time controlled PEEP, since the lung was allowed time to empty.|$|R

While he opposed more frequent parliaments, he still upheld the doctrine that [...] "to govern according to the sense, and agreeably to the interests, of the people is a great and glorious object of government."

And these were the kind of foundations which Burke had been laying, while Fox was yet a Tory, while Sheridan was writing farces, and while Grey was a schoolboy.|$|R

500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball.

Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic."

Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes.

After the complete evaporationof the solvent,microsphereswith thediameters ranging fromhundredsof nanometers to several micrometers were prepared. The microsphere patterns are the reverse of the honeycomb porous structure of breath figure. The mechanism of the microsphere formation has been studied to show that when the surface tension of the polymer solution is 1. 5 mN/m higher than that of the condensed liquid, microsphere patterns can be prepared,whereas a honeycombporous filmof breath figure can be obtainedwhen the surface tension of the polymer solution is lower than that of the condensed liquid. The viscosity of the polymer solution is also an important factor to influence the fabrication of the microsphere patterns. 1...|$|R

The goal {{of this study is}} to validate mathematical algorithms that automatically detect IEE in a computerized (Better Care®) system that obtains and processes data from intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in real time. Methods The Better Care® system, integrated with ICU health information systems, synchronizes and processes data from bedside technology. Algorithms were developed to analyze airflow waveforms during expiration to determine IEE. Data from 2, 608, 800 breaths from eight patients were recorded. From these breaths 1, 024 were randomly selected. Five experts independently analyzed the selected breaths and classified them as IEE or not IEE. Better Care® evaluated <b>the</b> <b>same</b> 1, 024 <b>breaths</b> and assigned a score to each one. The IEE score cutoff point was determined based on the experts’ analysis.

Results Optimal sensitivity and specificity were achieved by setting the cutoff point for IEE by Better Care® at 42...|$|R
60|$|It is not {{contended that}} the act of Parliament did not {{expressly}} ordain an inquiry. It is not asserted that this inquiry was not, with equal precision of terms, specially committed, under particular regulations, to the Court of Directors. I conceive, therefore, the Board of Control had no right whatsoever to intermeddle in that business. There is nothing certain in the principles of jurisprudence, if this be not undeniably true, that when, a special authority is given to any persons by name to do some particular act, that no others, by virtue of general powers, can obtain a legal title to intrude themselves into that trust, and to exercise those special functions in their place. I therefore consider the intermeddling of ministers in this affair as a downright usurpation. But if the strained construction by which they have forced themselves into a suspicious office (which every man delicate with regard to character would rather have sought constructions to avoid) were perfectly sound and perfectly legal, of this I am certain, that they cannot be justified in declining the inquiry which had been prescribed to the Court of Directors. If the Board of Control did lawfully possess the right of executing the special trust given to that court, they must take it as they found it, subject to <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> regulations which bound the Court of Directors. It will be allowed that the Court of Directors had no authority to dispense with either the substance or the mode of inquiry prescribed by the act of Parliament.

What must we think of the fabric and texture of an act of Parliament which should find it necessary to prescribe a strict inquisition, that should descend into minute regulations for the conduct of that inquisition, that should commit this trust to a particular description of men, and in <b>the</b> very <b>same</b> <b>breath</b> should enable another body, at their own pleasure, to supersede all the provisions the legislature had made, and to defeat the whole purpose, end, and object of the law?

This alone is sufficient to show the situation of the Company's servants in the subordinate situations, when the mere claim of a right, derived from the sovereign legal power, becomes fatal not only to the objects which they pursue, but deeply wounds that reputation both for ability and integrity by which alone they are to be qualified for any other.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Our aim was {{to compare}} the {{apparent}} diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of normal abdominal parenchymal organs and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> patients with <b>breath</b> hold (BH) and free breathing (FB) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients underwent both BH and FB DWI. Spherical region of interest (ROI) {{was placed on the}} right hepatic lobe, spleen, pancreas, and renal cortices. ADC values were calculated for each organ on each sequence using an automated software. Image noise, defined as the standard deviation (SD) of the signal intensities in the most artifact-free area of the image background was measured by placing the largest possible ROI on either the left or {{the right side of the}} body outside the object in the recorded field of view. SNR was calculated using the formula: SNR=signal intensity (SI) (organ) /standard deviation (SD) (noise). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in ADC values of the abdominal organs between BH and FB DWI sequences (p> 0. 05). There were statistically significant differences between SNR values of organs on BH and FB DWIs. SNRs were found to be better on FB DWI than BH DWI (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Free breathing DWI technique reduces image noise and increases SNR for abdominal examinations. Free breathing technique is therefore preferable to BH DWI in the evaluation of abdominal organs by DWI...|$|R
40|$|Organ {{motion is}} a major problem for any dynamic {{radiotherapy}} delivery technique, and is particularly so for spot scanned proton therapy. On the other hand, the use of narrow, magnetically deflected proton pencil beams is potentially an ideal delivery technique for tracking tumour motion on-line. At PSI, our new Gantry is equipped with a Beams Eye View (BEV) imaging system which will be able to acquire 2 D x-ray images in fluoroscopy mode during treatment delivery. However, besides precisely tracking motion from BEVs, it is also essential to obtain information on the 3 D motion vector throughout the whole region of interest, and any sparsely acquired surrogate motion is generally not sufficient to describe the deformable behaviour of the whole volume in three dimensions. In this study, we propose a method by which 3 D deformable motions can be estimated from surrogate motions obtained using this monoscopic imaging system. The method assumes that example motions over a number of breathing cycles can be acquired before treatment for each patient using 4 DMRI. In this study, for each of 11 different subjects, 100 continuous breathing cycles have been extracted from extended 4 DMRI studies in the liver and then subject specific motion models have been built using principle component analysis (PCA). To simulate treatment conditions, a different set of 30 continuous breathing cycles from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> subjects have then been used to generate a set of simulated 4 DCT data sets (so-called 4 DCT(MRI) data sets), from which time-resolved digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were calculated using the BEV geometry for three treatment fields respectively. From these DRRs, surrogate motions from fiducial markers or the diaphragm have been used as a predictor to estimate 3 D motions in the liver region for each subject. The prediction results have been directly compared to the 'ground truth' motions extracted from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> 30 <b>breath</b> cycles of the originating 4 DMRI data set. Averaged over all 11 subjects, and for three field directions, for 99 % of predicted positions, median (max) error magnitudes of better than 2. 63 (5. 67) mm can be achieved when fiducial markers was chosen as predictor. Furthermore, three single fields, 4 D dose calculations have been performed as a verification tool to evaluate the prediction performance of such a model in the context of scanned proton beam therapy. These show a high similarity between plans considering either PCA predicted motion or ground truth motion, where absolute dose differences of more than 5 % (V(dosediff = 5 %)) occur for the worst field scenarios in only 3. 61 % (median) or 15. 13 % (max) of dose calculation points in the irradiated volume. The magnitude of these dose differences were insignificantly dependent on whether surrogate motions were tracked by monoscopic or stereoscopic imaging systems, or whether fiducial markers or diaphragm were chosen as surrogate. This study has demonstrated that on-line deformable motion reconstruction from sparse surrogate motions is feasible, even when using only a monoscopic imaging system. In addition, it has also been found that diaphragm motion can be considered as a good predictor for respiratory deformable liver motion prediction, implying that fiducial markers might not be compulsory if used in conjunction with a patient specific PCA based model...|$|R
