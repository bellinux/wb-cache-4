5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of <b>tetrodotoxin</b> in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} <b>tetrodotoxin</b> resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E
5|$|The {{great variety}} of carbon {{compounds}} include such lethal poisons as <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> the lectin ricin from seeds of the castor oil plant Ricinus communis, cyanide (CN), and carbon monoxide; and such essentials to life as glucose and protein.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison <b>tetrodotoxin</b> from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, <b>tetrodotoxin</b> poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E
5|$|While {{driving down}} the road, Mulder and Scully {{discover}} a still-living McAlpin, who doesn't remember {{what has happened to}} him. <b>Tetrodotoxin,</b> a chemical Mulder believes is part of Haitian zombification rituals, is found in McAlpin's blood. The agents go to the local graveyard to investigate the corpse of the other dead soldier, but find the grave robbed. They also find Chester, who collects frogs at the cemetery and sells them to Bauvais. Dunham approaches Mulder, telling him that Wharton has begun abusing the refugees as a means of retaliation against Bauvais; Wharton denies the accusations, but later has Bauvais beaten to death.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first {{lines of}} defence are the {{saponins}} present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as <b>tetrodotoxin</b> among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out {{large quantities of}} repellent mucus. They also have body armour {{in the form of}} hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin <b>tetrodotoxin</b> (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
25|$|Animal {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} the mortality of aconitine is lowered by <b>tetrodotoxin.</b> The toxic effects of aconitine were attenuated by <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> probably due to their mutual antagonistic effect on excitable membranes.|$|E
25|$|The toxin {{is called}} <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> or more {{precisely}} anhydrotetrodotoxin 4-epitetrodotoxin and is about 1200 times deadlier than cyanide. This poison {{can also be found}} in other animals such as the Blue-Ringed Octopus, cone snails, and even some newts. The pufferfish does not create the poison itself; rather it is generated by bacteria e.g. Pseudomonas within the fish. The fish obtains the bacteria by eating food containing these bacteria. Pufferfish that are born and grown in captivity do not produce <b>tetrodotoxin</b> until they receive some of the poison-producing bacteria, often by eating tissues from a toxin-producing fish. Also, some fish are more poisonous than others. Each fish has enough poison to kill around thirty adult humans.|$|E
25|$|Though {{diverse in}} {{chemical}} properties and functions, neurotoxins share the common property that they act by some mechanism leading {{to either the}} disruption or destruction of necessary components within the nervous system. Neurotoxins, however, by their very design can be very useful {{in the field of}} neuroscience. As the nervous system in most organisms is both highly complex and necessary for survival, it has naturally become a target for attack by both predators and prey. As venomous organisms often use their neurotoxins to subdue a predator or prey very rapidly, toxins have evolved to become highly specific to their target channels such that the toxin does not readily bind other targets (see s). As such, neurotoxins provide an effective means by which certain elements of the nervous system may be accurately and efficiently targeted. An early example of neurotoxin based targeting used radiolabeled <b>tetrodotoxin</b> to assay sodium channels and obtain precise measurements about their concentration along nerve membranes. Likewise through isolation of certain channel activities, neurotoxins have provided the ability to improve the original Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron in which it was theorized that single generic sodium and potassium channels could account for most nervous tissue function. From this basic understanding, the use of common compounds such as <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> tetraethylammonium, and bungarotoxins have led to a much deeper understanding of the distinct ways in which individual neurons may behave.|$|E
25|$|Using chloride-containing patch-clamp {{electrodes}} in 2006, spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs) {{were recorded}} in about 30% of the CR cells in P0-P2 rat cerebral cortex. These sPSCs decreased to about 10% at P4, indicating that CR cells became functionally disconnected during further development. these sPSCs were reversibly blocked by bicuculline, a light-sensitive competitive antagonist of GABA-A receptors, suggesting activation of GABA-A receptors in these sPSCs. Moreover, the frequency and amplitude of these sPSCs was not influenced by <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> which inhibits the firing of action potentials in nerves, indicating that these sPSCs are independent on presynaptic action potentials.|$|E
25|$|While at Stanford, Mosher taught organic {{chemistry}} and conducted research in natural products chemistry and stereochemistry. He and his graduate student Melanchton Brown identified a deadly toxin {{produced by the}} California newt living in Stanford's Lake Lagunita, calling it tarichatoxin. They soon discovered {{that it was the}} same toxin produced by the puffer fish, used in a rare type of sushi that if prepared incorrectly could paralyze and kill human diners. Mosher determined the structure of the toxin, which is known as <b>tetrodotoxin.</b> Mosher worked on many other natural products including both plant pigments and toxic substances.|$|E
25|$|The fish {{is highly}} toxic, but despite this—or {{perhaps because of}} it—it is {{considered}} a delicacy in Japan. The fish contains lethal amounts of the poison <b>tetrodotoxin</b> in the internal organs, especially the liver and the ovaries, {{but also in the}} skin and the testes. Therefore, only specially licensed chefs can prepare and sell fugu to the public, and the consumption of the liver and ovaries is forbidden. But because small amounts of the poison give a special desired sensation on the tongue, these parts are considered the most delicious by some gourmets. Every year a number of people die because they underestimate the amount of poison in the consumed fish parts.|$|E
25|$|Neurotoxins are toxins {{that are}} {{poisonous}} or destructive to nerve tissue (causing neurotoxicity). Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue. The term {{can also be}} used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contacted, can prove neurologically toxic. Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems. Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol (drinking alcohol), manganese glutamate, nitric oxide , botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), tetanus toxin, and <b>tetrodotoxin.</b> Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for proper function of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at excessive concentrations.|$|E
500|$|Up to [...] {{long with}} {{distinctive}} leopard-like dark markings on its dorsal side, the smooth toadfish has a rounded front and tapers {{to a narrow}} tail at the back. Unlike most of its relatives, {{it does not have}} prominent spines on its body. Like other pufferfish, it can inflate itself with water or air. It forages for its preferred foods—molluscs and crustaceans—in sand and mud of the bottom sediment. Often an unwanted catch by anglers, the smooth toadfish is highly poisonous because of the <b>tetrodotoxin</b> present in its body, and eating it may result in death.|$|E
500|$|Squires {{drops his}} cup, as Nina {{continues}} {{to fill in}} the crossword, including SOWERBERRY and KNOWITALL. Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina reveals herself as a marine biologist, and has acquired <b>tetrodotoxin</b> from a pufferfish, which causes paralysis and asphyxiation. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a u looked more like a v. Depressed by the trivial defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. He leaps up to fill out NEUN and ASPS, revealing the nina ISWAPPEDCUPS within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's supervisor. Squires places Nina—for whom paralysis is setting in—on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out UNDERSLIP.|$|E

2500|$|Sodium {{channels}} {{were the}} first voltage-gated ion channels to be isolated in 1984 from the eel Electrophorus electricus by Shosaku Numa. The pufferfish toxin <b>tetrodotoxin</b> (TTX), a sodium channel blocker, was used to isolate the sodium channel protein by binding it using the column chromatography technique for chemical separation. The amino acid sequence of the protein was analyzed by Edman degradation and then used to construct a cDNA library {{which could be used}} to clone the channel protein. Cloning the channel itself allowed for applications such as identifying the same channels in other animals.|$|E
2500|$|Several neurotoxins, {{both natural}} and synthetic, are {{designed}} to block the action potential. [...] <b>Tetrodotoxin</b> from the pufferfish and saxitoxin from the Gonyaulax (the dinoflagellate genus responsible for [...] "red tides") [...] block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel;* * [...] similarly, dendrotoxin from the black mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel. [...] Such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose, by allowing scientists to [...] "turn off" [...] specific channels at will, thus isolating [...] the other channels' contributions; {{they can also be}} useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration. However, such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins, and have been considered for use as chemical weapons. [...] Neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides; one example is the synthetic permethrin, which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials. [...] The ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tetrodotoxin</b> (TTX) is {{a poison}} {{produced}} by organisms {{belonging to the}} Tetradontidae order, which includes the puffer fish, ocean sunfish, and porcupine fish. Within the puffer fish, which is a common delicacy especially in Japan, TTX {{is found in the}} liver, gonads, ovaries, intestines, and skin. TTX can be fatal if consumed, and has become a common form of poisoning in many countries. Common symptoms of TTX consumption include paraesthesia (often restricted to the mouth and limbs), muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting and often manifest within 30 minutes of ingestion. The primary mechanism by which TTX is toxic is through the inhibition of sodium channel function, which reduces the functional capacity of neuron communication. This inhibition largely affects a susceptible subset of sodium channels known as TTX-sensitive (TTX-s), which also happens to be largely responsible for the sodium current that drives the depolarization phase of neuron action potentials. [...] TTX-resistant (TTX-r) is another form of sodium channel which has limited sensitivity to TTX, and is largely found in small diameter axons such as those found in nociception neurons. When significant levels of TTX is ingested, it will bind sodium channels on neurons and reduce their membrane permeability to sodium. This results in an increased effective threshold of required excitatory signals in order to induce an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. The effect of this increased signaling threshold is a reduced excitability of postsynaptic neurons, and subsequent loss of motor and sensory function which can result in paralysis and death. Though assisted ventilation may increase the chance of survival after TTX exposure, there is currently no antitoxin. The use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Neostigmine or the muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist Atropine (which will inhibit parasympathetic activity), however, can increase sympathetic nerve activity enough to improve the chance of survival after TTX exposure.|$|E
50|$|The major neurotoxin {{component}} of the blue-ringed octopus {{is a compound that}} was originally known as maculotoxin but was later found to be identical to <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> a neurotoxin also found in pufferfish, and in some poison dart frogs. <b>Tetrodotoxin</b> is 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide. <b>Tetrodotoxin</b> blocks sodium channels, causing motor paralysis, and respiratory arrest within minutes of exposure. The <b>tetrodotoxin</b> is produced by bacteria in the salivary glands of the octopus.|$|E
50|$|Recently, the {{presence}} of <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> a very potent neurotoxin, was recorded in B. adventitium and B. kewense. It is the first record of <b>tetrodotoxin</b> in terrestrial invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{background}} {{is not a}} factor in susceptibility to <b>tetrodotoxin</b> poisoning. This toxicosis may be avoided by not consuming animal species known to contain <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> principally pufferfish; other tetrodotoxic species are not usually consumed by humans.|$|E
50|$|The porcupinefish {{concentrates}} a poison, called <b>tetrodotoxin,</b> {{in certain}} parts of its body such as the liver, skin, gonads and the viscera. <b>Tetrodotoxin</b> is a powerful neurotoxin.

The victim remains conscious and alert {{in a manner similar to}} curare or pancuronium bromide. This effect, however, is temporary and will fade over a period of hours as the <b>tetrodotoxin</b> is metabolized and excreted by the body.|$|E
