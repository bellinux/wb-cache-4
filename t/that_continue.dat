A semi-structured interview was conducted with eleven mothers and their {{junior high and high}} school children (twenty-two interviewees in total). As a result, the following seven pains and their duration were clarified. (1) Severe pain immediately after surgery and during hospitalization (Ten days after surgery), (2) Pain when changing posture <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about three months, (3) Pain caused by restrictions on daily physical activities <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about three months, (4) Pain associated with whole-body vibration <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about three months, (5) Pain due to upper limb movement <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about six months, (6) Pain due to contact and impact <b>that</b> <b>continues</b> for about one year, (7) Pain or discomfort due to the bar implant that remains for one year or more, In most of the pain categories, mothers described the duration of pain as being much longer than their children.

5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells <b>that</b> <b>continue</b> to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|Although Edward reigned {{for only}} {{six years and}} {{died at the age}} of 15, his reign made a lasting {{contribution}} to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England. The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to more conservative values. By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation. In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Roman Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant. In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices <b>that</b> <b>continue</b> to this day. Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts <b>that</b> <b>continue</b> from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|During Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), {{the use of}} Pe̍h-ōe-jī was {{suppressed}} and it faced further countermeasures {{during the}} Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those <b>that</b> <b>continue</b> to use Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of pe̍h-ōe-jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.|$|E

These include cherry bombs, rockets, Roman candles and spinners.|$|E
