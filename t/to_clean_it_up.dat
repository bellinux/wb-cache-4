25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The downside to this, however, is that much ground pollution remains from the track’s previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> which it has thus far avoided by not digging into the ground under the tracks.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News {{was founded}} in 1923 by Cornelius Vanderbilt IV, who wished {{to start his own}} {{newspaper}} chain. The young Vanderbilt had served as a news reporter in New York for four years, but had no experience running a paper. Believing the best newspaper was a democratic one, he offered voting rights to those who would pay $5 for a year's subscription to his newspaper. [...] Repudiating the legendary adage of William Henry Vanderbilt, [...] "The public be damned," [...] Vanderbilt announced that the paper's philosophy would be [...] "The public be served." [...] Vanderbilt ignored attempts by the newspaper moguls who dominated Los Angeles journalism, William Randolph Hearst and Harry Chandler, to warn him off. Denied advertising in other newspapers, Vanderbilt attempted to gain publicity for his paper by having trucks drive through the streets bearing the paper's banner, and [...] hiring boys to chalk the paper's name on sidewalks, much to the annoyance of landowners who had <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

50|$|The court {{accepted}} the evidence proving {{the girl had}} stayed at the various places she mentioned, but said that these did not prove non-consent. The girl then just passed the age of consent (then 16 years), so the cases could not be treated as statutory rape. The court noted she had given away her hostel fees to someone and pawned her jewellery. She had given a false name while pawning it. She had been questioned in the Sister Abhaya murder case {{but she said she}} couldn't remember it. The court noted that she was expelled from the Mount Carmel School, Kottayam, in Class 8, was home-tutored for a year, before joining Little Flower Girls High School, Nallathanni. When asked for the reason of expulsion, she said that she used to wet her bed and her older sister used <b>to</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> But, after her sister graduated, she could no longer clean up. But, her tutor, presented as a witness, said that she was expelled for bad conduct. There was also evidence that the father kept close tabs on her movements and frequently called the nuns of the convent school. On 16 January, the school had called the father to inform him that the girl had sought permission to go and give her clothes to the laundry.|$|R
50|$|The game also {{involves}} exploration stages {{that can be}} accessed after unlocking new jobs. These areas allow the player to dabble in more traditional Chibi-Robo gameplay. However, rather than unlocking or buying new items in order <b>to</b> better <b>clean</b> and traverse the area, necessary tools are received upon entering the area. Trash and dust piles litter the vicinity, and Chibi-Robo has the option <b>to</b> either <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> or just explore the area. However, in order to leave the area, Chibi-Robo must dispose of the collected refuse in a Recycling Machine located near the exit. The compactor will then reward you for your efforts; the more trash you pick up, the more Happy Points are rewarded.|$|R

Huldah warns that it may not be enough <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> all <b>up,</b> that the old has to come down before a new community can begin. By God's grace we recognize that the word of judgment has come especially to patriarchal hierarchies that possess the temple. We know that the axe has been laid to the root of that tree.

The Angries change colour {{according}} to their mood, purple being the ultimate state of anger and despair. Completing certain tasks gives the Angries extra powers, such as the ability to create street art, and certain infrastructure repairs improve the areas communications and give the community new systems for their benefit. Keith Stuart of The Guardian described some of these—"Reactivating a communications tower will get the word out about clean-up efforts, ... the trade plaza represents commerce and a system that pumps curry into every home is a great allegory for everyday utilities." ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{graffiti}} became {{associated with}} crime, many {{demanded that the}} government take a more serious stance toward it, particularly after the popularization of the Fixing Broken Windows philosophy in 1982. By the 1980s, increased police surveillance and implementation of increased security measures (razor wire, guard dogs) combined with continuous efforts <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> led to the weakening of the New York's graffiti subculture. As a result of subways being harder to paint, more writers went into the streets, which is now, along with commuter trains and box cars, the most prevalent form of writing. [...] But the streets became more dangerous due to the burgeoning crack epidemic, legislation was underway to make penalties for graffiti artists more severe, and restrictions on paint sale and display made obtaining materials difficult.|$|E
2500|$|The Protocols is a {{fabricated}} document {{purporting to}} be factual. Textual {{evidence shows that}} it could not have been produced prior to 1901. It is notable that the title of Sergei Nilus's widely distributed edition contains the dates [...] "1902–1903", and {{it is likely that the}} document was actually written at this time in Russia, despite Nilus' attempt to cover this up by inserting French-sounding words into his edition. Cesare G. De Michelis argues that it was manufactured in the months after a Russian Zionist congress in September 1902, and that it was originally a parody of Jewish idealism meant for internal circulation among antisemites until it was decided <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and publish it as if it were real.

2500|$|Butler’s field {{research}} in Maryland also influenced her writing of Kindred.

On this tour, guides referred to the slaves as [...] "servants" [...] and avoided referring {{to the fact that the}} visitors were touring an old slave plantation. Butler also spent time reading emancipatory narratives, one of them being the slave narrative of Fredrick Douglass. Some of the facts she learned from these narratives were so grim that she realized that, in order to get people to read Kindred, she could not come close to presenting slavery as it was but had <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

40|$|Vandalism {{is a type}} of the {{so-called}} low intensity crimes. However, the nuisance and damage caused by it could cost dearly to the public <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up.</b> <b>It</b> is also technically difficult in the past to detect and prosecute such a crime, for example, graffiti making. This paper presents an automatic and live graffiti detection system using CCTV cameras and innovative vision algorithms. After a brief introduction on the problem domain, the paper proceeds to proposing a system prototype through highlighting its essential operations such as human shape and head curve recognition for triggering the follow-up operations of graffiti detection. The research methodology, the devised algorithms, and the experiment designs are then explained in details. The experiments in this programme are based on real CCTV footages recorded at a bus station. The result shows that the proposed system can detect graffiti-making actions and to locate graffiti occurring areas effectively under most live illumination conditions and is a practical solution for the design of intelligent real-time CCTV surveillance systems...|$|R

2500|$|In 1934, Roosevelt {{named his}} friend Joseph P. Kennedy, a self-made multimillionaire [...] {{financier}} {{and leader of}} the Irish community, as the insider-as-chairman who knew Wall Street well enough <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Two of the other five commissioners were James M. Landis (one of the architects of the 1934 Act and other New Deal legislation) and Ferdinand Pecora (Chief Counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during its investigation of Wall Street banking and stock brokerage practices). Kennedy added a number of brilliant young lawyers, including William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom later became Supreme Court justices. Kennedy's team defined the mission and operating mode for the SEC, making full use of its wide range of legal powers. The SEC had four missions. First and most important was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed because of doubts about its internal integrity, and fears of the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had {{to get rid of the}} penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.|$|E

The park ranger initially starts to pick <b>it</b> <b>up</b> himself, but then decides that he shouldn't {{have to do}} it because he is the boss. He then calls Humphrey and the other resident bears and asks them to [...] "put it in the bag", while singing and dancing to a catchy song. The bears happily collect the trash, bouncing and jouncing until they discover the ranger's actual motivation. With Humphrey dropping the ranger into a garbage can, the bears angrily dump their bags of refuse on the ground. Realizing that he should at least reward the bears for their assistance, the ranger prepares some chicken cacciatore, but says that he will only give it to the bears on the condition that they clean up their sections of the park. All of the bears then move their garbage into one section, leaving Humphrey <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> all <b>up</b> himself. He does this quickly by stuffing the garbage into a bag, but as he is returning to receive his dinner, the bag gets caught on the twig of a tree stump and rips apart, letting the garbage out. The ranger then gives him a new bag and Humphrey follows the garbage down the line all the way to a cliff, but falls off as the puts the last scrap in the bag. Next, he attempts to conceal the garbage under a bush, but the bush {{turns out to be the}} home of a rabbit, who disgustedly pushes it back out. Humphrey then tries to burn the garbage with a match, but is stopped by Smokey the Bear, who reminds him that [...] "only you can prevent forest fires." [...] Finally, Humphrey puts all of the trash into a hollow stump, which is actually a geyser named [...] "Ol' Fateful". The ranger prepares to reward Humphrey with a dish full of cacciatore, but before Humphrey can take it, the geyser suddenly erupts, spouting the garbage everywhere, resulting in Humphrey having to start all over again at cleaning up the park.|$|R
40|$|Estuaries are {{the transit}} zones {{where the river}} basins drain into the sea. These rivers are {{convenient}} borders between countries and historically they have been separating rather than bringing together people. In the present day situation, the handicap of river basins often covering several countries is still all too visible, despite the important efforts to coordinate and tune management and research. The Scheldt is a typical example where historically the interests of different users have often led to conflicts, and this continues till today. It {{is well known that}} human use of the Scheldt has brought the system to the limits of its resilience and beyond. The biogeochemical state of the system has changed in a qualitative way and despite increasing and costly efforts <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>up,</b> <b>it</b> will take many years before it returns to its original state, if at all. In the saline part of the estuary most of the human impact over the centuries has been through constructing dykes and dredging the channels, and restoration of (part of) the original ecosystem will be difficult as well as costly. All the past impacts and the present international context have greatly stimulated scientific research in the basin. The Scheldt estuary {{is one of the best}} studied in the world but still a lot of uncertainties exist. This may be due to intrinsic characteristics of the basin (a difficult river system to understand) or because the research itself has been fragmented, within the agencies and the academic institutes and between them, or because the research has been ill-guided (or poor). In the last few years there have been several efforts to overcome these difficulties and to go for rational management of the entire basin. This will require good cooperation between countries, agencies, academic research and the end-user. The new initiatives (Flemish-Dutch Cooperation in Estuarine Research and the LTV) will certainly help to achieve this long-term objective...|$|R
