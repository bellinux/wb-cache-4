Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was looking at her, but the eye of God, who sees every <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, {{did not think of}} God." ...|$|E

500|$|Clive Owen, {{discussing}} the film's relevance, said it [...] "ultimately does {{ask questions about}} whether banks use people's money appropriately, and if they're completely sound institutions." [...] More baldly put, Philip French, reviewing the film in The Observer, surmised the sentiment as [...] "Let's kill all the bankers", a modern-day version of Dick the Butcher's [...] "First <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> let's kill all the lawyers" [...] from Shakespeare's Henry the Sixth, Part II. Salinger's (Owen) central revelation {{is that the world}} is governed by anonymous forces, staffed by disposable individuals.

[...] Dennis noted the two are [...] "not consistently coded as romantic partners," [...] since they live in separate residences, and have distinct groups of friends, but claimed that in the series, [...] "the possibility of same-sex desire is never excluded." [...] Martin Goodman of Animation World Magazine described Dennis's comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick as [...] "interesting." ...|$|E

According to Lee, Wind-up Records was experiencing [...] "uncertain times" [...] which would further delay the album's release. Label president Ed Vetri supported Lee's decision: [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> at Wind-up is, we're patient. I it's not right, it's not coming out.

500|$|Characters on Animaniacs had catchphrases, {{with some}} {{characters}} {{having more than}} one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's [...] "Goodnight, everybody!" [...] often said following adult humor, Wakko's [...] "Faboo!" [...] and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was [...] "Hello-o-o, nurse!" [...] Tom Ruegger said that the [...] "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" [...] line {{was intended to be}} a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, [...] "What's up, doc?" [...] Before the theme song for each [...] "Pinky and the Brain" [...] segment, Pinky asks, [...] "Gee, Brain, {{what do you want to}} do tonight?" [...] Brain replies, [...] "The same <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!" [...] During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, [...] "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" [...] and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode [...] "Win Big," [...] and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Jeffery P. Dennis said in {{the journal}} article [...] "The Same <b>Thing</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> Every Night: Signifying Same-Sex Desire in Television Cartoons" [...] that Ren and Stimpy are within a world where [...] "gay identities cannot exist," [...] so the series portrays {{same-sex}} romantic desire as [...] "anomalous and perverse." [...] Dennis added that the critics of the series [...] "made much" [...] of the gay connotations of Ren and Stimpy, such as their sharing of a house and bed, their reminiscing of a wedding, and Stimpy's [...] "giving birth" [...] to flatulence. [...] Dennis said that Ren is [...] "socially and sexually" [...] the aggressor in the relationship; in addition he says that some episodes portray Stimpy as [...] "a stereotypical 1950s wife" [...] who cleans, cooks food, and irons Ren's underwear. Dennis stated that the aspects [...] "may adhere to a reading of a sexual relationship." [...] Dennis concludes {{that the relationship between}} Ren and Stimpy is a parody of heterosexual relationships rather than an actual gay or an actual romantic relationship. Dennis adds that in other situations Ren and Stimpy are [...] "read more appropriately" [...] as coworkers, enemies, friends, and house pets. Dennis argues that Yogi Bear and Boo-Boo are more consistently gay than Ren and Stimpy. Dennis also stated that the scenes of Ren and Stimpy as a couple emulate a heterosexual couple instead of being a union between two men.|$|E
