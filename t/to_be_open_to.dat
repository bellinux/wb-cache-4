5|$|In March 2015, the Federal Highway Administration {{issued a}} Record of Decision {{selecting}} a build alternative. Freeway construction began in early 2016, with the Chandler Boulevard extension project to facilitate local access beginning in summer 2015. The freeway is planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> traffic in late 2019 or early 2020.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was partly}} {{demolished}} {{just after the}} war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen {{as a threat to}} the United Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 to serve as a mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management. It continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the public as a vast underground museum complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{standardized}} {{procedures for}} testimony by forensic chemists {{are provided by}} the various agencies that employ the scientists as well as SWGDRUG. Forensic chemists are ethically bound to present testimony in a neutral manner and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> reconsidering their statements if new information is found. Chemists should also limit their testimony to areas they have been qualified in regardless of questions during direct or cross-examination.|$|E
5|$|Within a fortnight, {{the navy}} had its first victory when the Asiatic Squadron, led by Commodore George Dewey, {{destroyed}} the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines. Dewey's overwhelming victory expanded {{the scope of}} the war from one centered in the Caribbean to one that would determine the fate of all of Spain's Pacific colonies. The next month, he increased the number of troops sent to the Philippines and granted the force's commander, Major General Wesley Merritt, the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes—necessities for a long occupation. By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898, McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States. He professed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> all views on the subject; however, he believed that as the war progressed, the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> white settlement.|$|E
50|$|The caves <b>were</b> <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> {{the public}} on 1 of October 1996, {{being one of the}} first caves of {{volcanic}} origins <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> the public in Portugal.|$|R

25|$|In {{recognition}} of its {{historical and cultural}} significance, the tower has been classified as monument historique by the French government since 1952. It {{is the only one}} of the castle's buildings <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> visitors today.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem was}} {{a profusion of}} windows. When moving around the Prograph workspace, the IDE {{generally}} required a new window <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> see the contents of methods.|$|R

25|$|Allman {{also played}} Tootsie Sagwell on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show {{during the early}} 1940s. She was Gracie's best friend who was {{constantly}} chasing show announcer Bill Goodwin in particular but seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> any man who'd have her.|$|E
25|$|Alton Towers {{first began}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> {{the public on}} a regular basis {{following}} the opening of Alton railway station. Money raised from railway excursions was paid to the Earl and helped to maintain the upkeep of the grounds.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by Wilhelm Wundt's {{theories}} on introspection, Rădulescu-Motru {{moved away from}} Kantian philosophy and its tenet regarding the impossibility of transcending reality as perceived through the senses. He considered metaphysics <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> objective scrutiny, and placed their knowledge at the summit of philosophical approaches.|$|E
50|$|The last section <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> traffic <b>was</b> {{between the}} exits at Borken and Neuental in December 1994. There {{has been no}} further {{extension}} of the A 49 since then.|$|R
50|$|In systems {{which need}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> air for maintenance, a {{titanium}} sublimation pump provides similar functionality to flashed getters, {{but can be}} flashed repeatedly. Alternatively, nonevaporable getters may be used.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, the {{government}} {{raised the possibility}} that Telstra's regional mobile network may <b>be</b> forced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>opened</b> <b>to</b> competitor' use under a roaming scheme. A prospect strongly being fought by Telstra.|$|R
25|$|In October 2007 McCreevy, {{commenting on}} the Northern Rock Bank's loss of {{investor}} confidence, claimed that banking regulations in England which forces banks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> scrutiny from outside investors, caused the panic. He said if access to the banks dealings had been restricted, then the trouble could have been avoided.|$|E
25|$|Youngen {{earned her}} {{doctorate}} {{degree from the}} Ohio State University in 1971 while maintaining a leadership role on campus. A true competitor, she was always one {{to take on a}} challenge, whether it entailed racing one of her male students in the 1970s, or pushing for recreational programs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the community in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Pope Benedict XVI urged China <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> Christianity, {{and said}} that he hoped the Olympic Games would offer an example of {{coexistence}} among people from different countries.

25|$|The most {{unexpected}} discovery at Gnyozdovo was a Kerch amphora with the earliest inscription attested in the Old East Slavic. The excavator has inferred {{that the word}} горушна (gorušna), inscribed on the pot in Cyrillic letters, designates mustard that was kept there. This explanation has not been universally accepted and the inscription seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> different interpretations. The dating of the inscription to the mid-10th century suggests a hitherto unsuspected popularity of the Cyrillic script in pre-Christian Rus.|$|E
25|$|The Exhibition Building was {{designed}} by Page\Park Architects and constructed in 1998-2001 on newly purchased land. It is designed to reflect its links {{with the world of}} agricultural and nature, with large sliding entrance doors giving access to a wood-clad barn-like building. The other outer walls appear to be 'white-washed' and the lower portion of almost the whole of one side appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the ground outside, echoing the design of typical barns, cart sheds, etc.|$|E

In 1983 the statues were protected with a Grade II listing by English Heritage.|$|E
