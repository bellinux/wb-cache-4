5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E

25|$|First-class cricket {{also has}} a number of {{strategic}} elements not found in baseball, simply because the maximum time duration of the game is fixed (which can be up to five days for Test cricket) and a match not completed {{by the end of the}} time duration results in a draw regardless of the relative score (Although, in domestic competitions a 1st innings lead is beneficial a team's final standings). By contrast, baseball games are played to completion regardless of the time duration and there is no possibility for a tie or draw (with the exception of certain exhibition games such as the MLB All-Star Game, or in the case of Japan, where games are declared ties after 12 innings). There are no equivalents in baseball of, for example, deciding when to declare or whether or not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> opponent follow on.|$|E

[...] Misunderstood guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell reworked [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] with his later band, Juicy Lucy, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1970. [...] The song features Campbell's psychedlic steel guitar lines, which Thompson describes [...] "as fast and mean and dirty as any record could have been, a breakneck tour through the bayou swamps and dirt-track roads of the American South, powered by a guitar <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> fingers bleed".|$|E

Set out like a traditional text book on the ancient art of rhetoric, the adaptation featured a caricature of Cresswell as a philosopher teaching her lifetime's worth of sexual tricks and wiles to Dorethea, the fallen daughter of a ruined royalist. In this satirical parody, the madam advises her young student: [...] "You must cloath your discourse with a meek, grave, and pious aspect, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> sophistry pass for sincere and real".

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally and trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour {{in support of the}} album, choosing to work with Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's {{a lot of time to}} be sitting in some stinking-ass club with some guy puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the levity on their first train ride, the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts. The show opened previews in Boston on May 6. A majority of the Boston critics liked the show, and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein could fix {{the problems with the}} plot. The pair took out one song, [...] "Meat and Potatoes", which was felt to be too raunchy. After watching it performed by Joan McCracken, who played Betty (Carmen in the play-within-the-play), the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it. It was replaced by [...] "We Deserve Each Other", which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room. Another cut song, [...] "You Never Had It So Good", included lyrics which satirized the duo's own earlier efforts. Its lyrics, [...] "I'll sew, I'll bake / I'll try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> evenings all enchanted. / My honeycake, / I'm yours to take, but don't take me for granted", alluded to two songs from South Pacific, [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun".

500|$|Music critics universally {{criticized the}} video {{because of the}} limited amount of {{clothing}} Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video [...] "racy" [...] but {{in line with the}} perspective of her album: [...] "If you put it in context with my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed. In this album, I was screaming in a room — just like I was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the video [...] "overproduced and under-clothed." ...|$|E
