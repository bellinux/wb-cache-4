5|$|Arc {{discharge}}: {{this is a}} {{high power}} thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in metallurgical processes. For example, it is used <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> minerals containing Al2O3 to produce aluminium.|$|E
5|$|The ore {{from the}} Marcellus varied in thickness, {{becoming}} unworkably thin, and even disappearing altogether in places between the workable beds. The {{quality of the}} ore also varied, {{and it was not}} always profitable <b>to</b> <b>smelt,</b> as several furnaces built near iron ore mines in the Marcellus were abandoned before the ore and timber resources used to fuel them became scarce.|$|E
5|$|Flemish {{metallurgist}} and alchemist P. M. de Respour {{reported that}} he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, Étienne François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.|$|E

50|$|Sir Clement Clerke, 1st Baronet (died 1693) was an {{important}} (but financially unsuccessful) English entrepreneur, whose greatest achievement was {{the application of the}} reverberatory furnace (cupola) <b>to</b> <b>smelting</b> lead and copper, and to remelting pig iron for foundry purposes.|$|R
5|$|The Beaker culture arrived around 2,500BC, {{introducing}} {{drinking and}} food vessels constructed from clay, {{as well as}} vessels used as reduction pots <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> copper ores. It was during this time that major Neolithic monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better ploughs, advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), {{as well as the}} production of more effective weapons.|$|E
5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. They {{appear to be the}} first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The Hittites began <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E
25|$|Not {{content with}} this {{relatively}} minor operation, dozens of small workshops and craftsmen banded together <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> steel {{rather than just}} mill steel. Easy access to limestone from the Niagara Escarpment, coal mined in Appalachia, iron ore mined from the Canadian Shield and export markets through the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence system made Hamilton an important iron and steel producing city.|$|E
50|$|Querns {{were widely}} used in {{grinding}} metals ores after mining extraction. The aim was to liberate fine ore particles which could then be separated by washing for example, prior <b>to</b> <b>smelting.</b> They were thus {{widely used in}} gold mining in antiquity.|$|R
5|$|The first Mari {{provided}} the oldest wheels workshop {{to be discovered}} in Syria, and was a center of bronze metallurgy.

25|$|The {{individual}} miner’s {{family also}} contributed; the sons {{worked on the}} uncovered washing platforms (exposed to the elements in all weathers) washing the impurities from the ore prior <b>to</b> <b>smelting,</b> and the wives and daughters spun wool and embroidered muslin for sale in Glasgow.|$|R
25|$|Iron {{foundries}} required immense {{amounts of}} wood, converted into charcoal, <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> the iron in blast furnaces. Timber and ore were {{the raw materials}} of smelted iron: each furnace required a permanent wood-lined pit for casting. The earliest cannons cast by the foundry belonging to the Levetts were of the Italianate style originating in Venice and copied by the English. By adapting the European style, the English turned Sussex and Kent into {{the centre of the}} European gun-making industry.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the beakers were designed for the consumption of alcohol, and that the introduction of the substance to Europe may have fuelled the beakers' spread. Beer and mead content have been identified from certain examples. However, not all Beakers were drinking cups. Some were used as reduction pots <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> copper ores, others have some organic residues associated with food, and still others were employed as funerary urns. They were used as status display amongst disparate elites.|$|E
25|$|Practical {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} refining of ores and their extraction <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> metals was {{an important source of}} information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them Georg Agricola (1494–1555), who published his great work De re metallica in 1556. His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. His approach removed the mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could build.|$|E

50|$|All primary sulfide ores {{of copper}} sulfides, and most {{concentrates}} of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected <b>to</b> <b>smelting.</b> Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, {{but this is}} a minor part of the market.|$|R
25|$|Continuing {{improvements}} led to {{the furnace}} and bellows and provided, for the first time, the ability <b>to</b> <b>smelt</b> and forge of gold, copper, silver, and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from {{near the beginning of}} Neolithic times (about 10 ka). Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals {{led to the}} discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass (about 4000 BCE). The first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1800 BCE.|$|E
25|$|The Bellefonte & Buffalo Run and Nittany Valley & Southern were merged on March 16, 1885, to {{form the}} Buffalo Run, Bellefonte and Bald Eagle Railroad, under the {{presidency}} of James A. Beaver. The new company began to lay rail on the grade in April 1886, and began shipping ore from Lambourn Bank (near Waddle) to the McCoy & Linn furnace in Bellefonte in January 1887. The Collins brothers also invested in local ore banks, including those at Red Bank. This was reached by a branch from Mattern Junction, on the horseshoe curve near Waddle. <b>To</b> <b>smelt</b> the ore, they began building Bellefonte Furnace near the new railroad's enginehouse in Coleville, {{on the outskirts of}} Bellefonte. The furnace was put in blast on February 1, 1888, but the local supplies of ore proved insufficient to sustain it and it was shut down in February 1891. Part of the Red Bank Branch would be abandoned in 1894.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the missions, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth.

25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the missions, the native peoples' way of life involved the utilization bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries decided that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine sex, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to support their social and economic goals.
