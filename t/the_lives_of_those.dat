5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E

Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E
