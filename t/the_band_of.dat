5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence.

In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Loving's early {{adulthood}} involved several stints in the U.S. Army as a musician, and later regimental bandleader.

50|$|Prior to {{the world}} wars, humane education—and <b>the</b> <b>Bands</b> <b>of</b> Mercy where {{children}} learned about it—was {{seen by many as}} a possible way to create a kinder and more peaceful world. The world wars dispelled much of this belief and thus <b>the</b> interest in <b>Bands</b> <b>of</b> Mercy. <b>The</b> red scare and the space race also focused much of U.S. education towards math and science, further reducing the immediate post-war interest in <b>Bands</b> <b>of</b> Mercy. In addition, the creation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bands</b> <b>of</b> Mercy was primarily driven by animal welfare organizations; as their attention and goals shifted away from early prevention to active intervention in abuse, much of the energy behind <b>the</b> <b>Bands</b> <b>of</b> Mercy dissipated.|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Kellogg's Grove, {{like many}} of the battles and skirmishes during the Black Hawk War, had no real order or strategy. Early sources {{indicated}} that the battle was a complete victory for the state militia, declaring the battle a rout and noting that the Sauk lost 15 while the militia only suffered 5 men killed. Conversely, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the result, essentially, was that <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> approximately 50 Sauk warriors routed the 300 or so ill-disciplined white troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{constellation}} was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.|$|E

DiStephano was added to the cast as the remaining soldier and guide for <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> survivors. In Alien Zone II: The Spaces of Science-fiction Cinema, Annette Kuhn calls DiStephano's death at the hands of the Newborn a perverse joke because of its juxtaposition of infantile features and curiosity with gruesome killing.|$|E
5|$|Although Collins {{used it as}} a {{catharsis}} for her {{opposition to}} the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, senior Scottish regiment of the British Army, recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the RPM national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The Pipe Major of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to Edinburgh Castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes. Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a bagpipes version ever since.|$|E

50|$|The {{device is}} {{operated}} by applying gate bias so that electron accumulation {{occurs in the}} intrinsic region. At sufficient gate bias, band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) occurs when <b>the</b> conduction <b>band</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic region aligns with <b>the</b> valence <b>band</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P region. Electrons from <b>the</b> valence <b>band</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> p-type region tunnel into <b>the</b> conduction <b>band</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic region and current can flow across the device.

5|$|Band of Gypsys is a live album by Jimi Hendrix and {{the first}} without his {{original}} group, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. It was recorded on January 1, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, frequently referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Band</b> <b>of</b> Gypsys. The album mixes funk and rhythm and blues elements with hard rock and jamming, an approach which later became the basis of funk rock. It contains previously unreleased songs and was the last full-length Hendrix album released before his death.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marius realizes that <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> barbarians he encountered years ago had invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with taking on the mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E

During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E

5|$|In a {{move that}} was {{described}} {{as an act of}} hurt pride by social historian David Smith, but also as a manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on Easter Monday 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould's honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president Sir John Llewellyn present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including David A. Thomas, were joined by a reed and string orchestra, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> the Fourth Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, and galleries packed by members of the public.|$|E

After completing another passage to Newport News in late June, Kroonland sailed on 19 July with 3,642 passengers—including officers, men, thirteen war brides, and one war baby—from Saint-Nazaire, in the final transport departure from that port before it was closed as a port of embarkation by U.S. military authorities.

He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told <b>the</b> <b>band</b> <b>of</b> his interest in recording music from a production standpoint.
