5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry.

Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

In 1890, Lilly turned over the day-to day management of the business to Josiah, who ran the company for thirty-four years. The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules.

Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E

5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry.

It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play.

The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use.

Afterward, Segata Sanshiro led the crowd in a Sonic chant, which will be used in the game.}} However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out {{by the end of the}} day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of Virtua Fighter 3, the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Key Dreamcast software titles Sonic Adventure and Sega Rally Championship 2, which had been delayed, arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software. Seaman, released in July 1999, was considered the Dreamcast's first major hit in Japan. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales. The price reduction and release of Namco's Soul Calibur helped Sega to gain 17 percent on its shares.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{optimizing}} a factory floor layout in a Slovenian furniture factory. First, the current state of <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system is analyzed by constructing a discrete event simulation (DES) model that reflects <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>The</b> company produces over 10, 000 different products, and their <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> include approximately 30, 000 subprocesses. Therefore, manually constructing a model to include every subprocess is not feasible. To overcome this problem, a method for automated model construction was developed to construct a DES model based on a selection of manufacturing orders and relevant subprocesses. The obtained simulation model provided insight into <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> and enable easy modification of model parameters for optimizing <b>the</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> optimization problem was solved: the total distance the products had to traverse between machines was minimized by devising an optimal machine layout. With the introduction of certain simplifications, the problem was best described as a quadratic assignment problem. A novel heuristic method based on force-directed graph drawing algorithms was developed. Optimizing the floor layout resulted in a significant reduction of total travel distance for the products...|$|R
