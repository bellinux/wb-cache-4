5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a critical level, the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E
25|$|An {{anomalistic month}} {{is longer than}} a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same {{direction}} as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.|$|E
25|$|This is an {{advanced}} technique that <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more than four}} and half hours to perform. Conventional abdominoplasty tightens muscles in a vertical line. In this new method, known as high lateral tension abdominoplasty, in addition to vertical-line tightening, muscles are tightened horizontally. The final result with this technique is a dramatically flat abdomen with significantly better-defined waistline.|$|E

Knowing the duration between the three instars and pupa stage and post-feeding larval dispersal can be useful to determine the post mortem interval in a criminal case.|$|E
25|$|After Burma was liberated, {{the road}} {{gradually}} fell into disrepair. In 1955 the Oxford-Cambridge Overland Expedition drove from London to Singapore and back. They followed {{the road from}} Ledo to Myitkyina and beyond (but not to China). The book First Overland written about this expedition by Tim Slessor (1957) reported that bridges were down in the section between Pangsau Pass and Shingbwiyang. In February 1958 the Expedition of Eric Edis and his team also used the road from Ledo to Myitkyina en route to Rangoon, Singapore and Australia. Ten months later they returned in the opposite direction. In his book about this expedition The Impossible <b>Takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Longer Edis (2008) reports that they have removed a yellow sign with India/Burma on it from the Indian/Burmese border {{and that they have}} donated it to the Imperial War Museum in London. For many years, travel into the region was also restricted by the Government of India. Because of continuous clashes between insurgents (who were seeking shelter in Burma) and the Indian Armed Forces, India imposed harsh restrictions between 1962 and the mid-1990s on travel into Burma.|$|E
500|$|Björk {{performed}} [...] "Cocoon" [...] on the 2001 Vespertine World Tour. It {{was later}} {{included on the}} DVD titled Live at Royal Opera House, released in 2002. The song was also performed by the singer on the American talk show The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Jeremy Allen from NME magazine included it on his list of [...] "10 Greatest Musical Moments" [...] on the show, commenting, [...] "with her fingers tinted like icicles and the background sonics just a sparse and glitchy soundscape with tinkles of warm xylophone {{like the inside of}} some ethereal cave, the singer <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of Iceland to the USA - via heaven - with her voice as commanding as it ever was". She also performed it across Europe following its release as a single, including The Jonathan Ross Show, Die Harald Schmidt Show, Johnny Vaughan Tonight, Top of the Pops, and Music Planet 2Nite.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Morrison's {{performance}} of [...] "Sway" [...] {{received the most}} divergent opinions. Some reviewers mentioned how closely it resembled Michael Bublé's version: Benigno graded it [...] "A-" [...] and said [...] "Matthew Morrison sounds EXACTLY like Bublé here, which is both unbelievably impressive (Bublé's got some pipes on him), and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit away from the number (easy to write it off as an impression)", Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and characterized it as [...] "pretty simple, but Matthew Morrison does a mean Michael Bublé", and Bentley called it [...] "a perfectly fine cover", though Futterman said it [...] "can’t beat Michael Bublé’s take". Among {{those who did not}} compare Morrison to Bublé, Hensel called it a [...] "beautiful solo performance", while Berk gave it two stars out of five and wrote [...] "Shue sings it just like a real wedding singer", and Nguyen said the song felt [...] "out of place".|$|E
500|$|Pat Nason of United Press International (UPI) {{wrote that}} {{marketing}} {{of the book}} [...] "may have been somewhat complicated by the cover art", which shows an actor in a gorilla costume with his middle finger raised, taken from the 1976 film A*P*E. Wilson had originally wanted the gorilla picture {{to appear on the}} back cover of the book; however, Warner Books stated it must appear on the book's front cover. [...] "It might stand as an apt emblem of the Razzies themselves," [...] commented Nason. [...] "We are not PC. We do not pull punches. We do not pay attention to the basic rules of decorum. Hopefully the humor with which it is packaged <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of the sting out of it", said Wilson to UPI. Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade described the book as [...] "a merchandising tie-in" [...] to the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson announced the nominees for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards at a book signing for The Official Razzie Movie Guide at Brentano's in Century City, Los Angeles, California.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} most songs in Laundry Service {{are based on}} issues and themes related to love, {{as they had been}} written after Shakira began a {{relationship}} Antonio de la Rúa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa. [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] is an [...] "ode" [...] to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an [...] "important side" [...] in [...] "The One", which is a song about how [...] "you love your guy so much that you’re actually going to learn to cook" [...] and contains lines like [...] "To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> help from someone." [...] In [...] "Rules", she aims to make her lover realise that he is [...] "condemned" [...] to her and lists [...] "all the things your new boy can do." [...] Songs like [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] and [...] "Fool" [...] also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a [...] "hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train." [...] In the song, Shakira asserts that [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible", which a reviewer commented was a [...] "brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers [...]" [...] "Fool" [...] discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a [...] "shitty, self-absorbed man" [...] even after suffering a [...] "soul-crushing defeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{particular}} day a letter arrives from Tancredi {{in which he}} asks the Prince to ask Angelica's father for her hand in marriage.

2500|$|As {{with all}} insects, the body {{consists}} of a head, thorax, and abdomen. [...] The thorax is divided into the prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax; the dorsal side of the prothorax is a sclerotized shield, the pronotum. [...] The Hister beetle has an exoskeleton made of chitin which gives protection to the internal organs. [...] The elytra and forewings are normally well developed in beetles, but in Histerdiae the elytra are shortened and rectangular. [...] The shortened elytra expose the final two of the seven tergites. Attached to the body are three pairs of jointed legs and two pairs of wings. [...] The head has compound eyes, a mandible mouthpart, and shortened antennae. [...] The eyes do not move; each <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> piece of the picture to make a complete picture. [...] The Hister's mouthpart grasps and grinds the food with two teeth. [...] Lastly, the antennae work as sensory organs. [...] A distinctive characteristic is that the antennae are elbowed and contain three antennomeres that form a club at the end.|$|E

2500|$|The Socorro dove is a medium-sized, principally {{terrestrial}} dove {{with long}} legs for a zenaida dove. It is [...] long and weighs [...] on average. In overall color pattern, it agrees with its relatives. It {{is considered to}} be a stronger-colored insular representative of the mourning dove. The male is deep cinnamon on its head and underparts, with an ear streak like its relatives. The nape is blue-grey and the neck has an iridescent pink patch, most prominent after moult. The upperparts are rufous brown. Female and juvenile coloration is slightly duller. The most conspicuous differences from the mourning dove – darker coloration and more well-developed feet – were useful amid the dark lava rock and the shady forests of its island home, where native mammalian predators were absent but constant threats from red-tailed hawks and great frigatebirds were present. The advertising call begins with a disyllabic coo, followed by three single calls, and ends with another disyllabic coo: [...] "Coo-oo, OO, OO, OO, Coo-oo".

[...] He added that the band thought they [...] "hit a ceiling" [...] with Hopeless Records since [...] "trying to tackle things like getting radio [...] and things like that was sort of becoming harder and harder {{based on the fact that}} the label hadn’t really done it before." [...] In December, the band began writing for their next album. The band demoed around 20 songs for inclusion on their next album before whittling the number down, with the aim of recording 15 or 16 of them. After touring in Australia as part of the Soundwave festival in February and March 2010, Gaskarth spent time writing new material in Los Angeles.|$|E
