5|$|On 17 May 2010, Oliver Fricker trespassed and vandalised car 1048 (<b>trainset</b> 047/048) with {{graffiti}} at Changi Depot. The graffiti {{was initially}} mistaken for an advertisement {{and was not}} spotted until the car was filmed and the video was uploaded to YouTube by a trainspotter. Fricker was {{convicted and sentenced to}} seven months' imprisonment and caning. The public perceived this incident to have serious security implications, as the depot was considered a sensitive installation.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 2016, 2 SMRT {{maintenance}} trainees {{were run}} over {{and killed by}} an oncoming C151 train (<b>trainset</b> 073/074) reportedly travelling at 60km/h, 150 metres from Pasir Ris MRT Station, at approximately 11.10 am. The maintenance staff were a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault on the tracks near the Pasir Ris MRT Station. This incident had led to a 2.5 hour train service disruption and at least 10,000 commuters were affected.|$|E

5000|$|Some of {{the most}} popular {{historic}} multiple unit <b>trainsets</b> are the Roten Pfeile ("Red Arrows") (RAe 2/4) and the [...] "Churchill-Pfeil" [...] (RAe 4/8). In international traffic the Trans-Europ-Express (TEE) diesel <b>trainsets</b> appeared in 1957, but were replaced by four-systems electric <b>trainsets</b> RAe TEEII in 1961.|$|R
5|$|The car {{numbers of}} the trains range from x001 to x132, where x depends on the {{carriage}} type. Individual cars are assigned a 4 digit serial number. A complete six-car <b>trainset</b> consists of an identical twin set of one driving trailer(DT) and two motor cars(M1 & M2) permanently coupled together. For example, set 099/100 consists of carriages 3099, 1099, 2099, 2100, 1100 and 3100.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a crimson streamliner might have hauled the blue <b>trainset.</b> Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each <b>trainset</b> could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
25|$|By 1940, Brooklyn {{had five}} 3 section {{articulated}} <b>trainsets</b> with PCC components, after WWII Chicago ordered four similar <b>trainsets.</b> Chicago ordered two from Pullman and two from St. Louis, with different equipment, so that competing manufacturers could be directly compared. Experience from the <b>trainsets</b> influenced the following car standards.|$|R
50|$|The line is an under-construction {{rapid transit}} line for Kuala Lumpur. The MRT line 1 will use Siemens Inspiro rolling stock. The rolling stock will be {{driveless}} {{and comes in}} 4-car <b>trainsets</b> which extra 10% length of Ampang Line 6-car <b>trainsets.</b> Expected capacity per <b>trainsets</b> is at 1,200 persons.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{contract}} of 22 <b>trainsets</b> of 6 cars each {{was awarded to}} Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CRRC Sifang by the Land Transport Authority. In 2013, a further order of 13 <b>trainsets</b> under Batch 2 was placed and as of 2014, all 35 <b>trainsets</b> have been officially put into revenue service.|$|R
5|$|In early 2000, the MBTA {{released}} a study which analyzed {{the possibility of}} full-time commuter service to Yawkey to serve workers at nearby Boston University, Kenmore Square, and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area. An addendum released in August 2000 analyzed increased service (on all modes) to Fenway Park on game days. Possibilities studied included running game day service from the Plymouth/Kingston Line with an unused <b>trainset,</b> a South Station-Yawkey shuttle, increased Green Line service, and bus shuttles to the Red Line in Cambridge and to Ruggles station. Consideration was given to building a dedicated terminal spur and station on {{the remains of the}} former Highland Branch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (<b>trainset</b> 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E
5|$|The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151, {{sometimes}} {{abbreviated to}} C151 or KHI C151 {{is the first}} generation electric multiple unit rolling stock in operation on the North South and East West Lines of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. These are the oldest trains built for the system; they were introduced in 1987 and are still in operation. Sixty-six trainsets consisting of six cars each and a single money <b>trainset</b> consisting of four cars were purchased. These trains are operated by SMRT Trains.|$|E
50|$|As of April 2013, {{there are}} 18 cars in service, {{generally}} operating as six 3-car <b>trainsets,</b> although 2-car <b>trainsets</b> are in use during off-peak times.|$|R
50|$|Now <b>trainsets</b> of Express Nakhon Phing are {{replaced}} with new <b>trainsets</b> from Changchun Railway Vehicles Co.,Ltd which consist of many conveniences {{provided in the}} cars.|$|R
50|$|The CityRail {{network was}} divided into three sectors, based around three {{maintenance}} depots. EMU <b>trainsets</b> were identified by target plates, which are exhibited on the front lower nearside of driving carriages. Target designations and set numbers were used in identifying EMU <b>trainsets.</b> The composition and formations of <b>trainsets,</b> and the target designations were subject to alteration.|$|R
5|$|Two years later, four {{units of}} vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays (VFD) were {{mounted on the}} ceiling. Eight units of dynamic route maps were mounted above every door in each car in <b>trainset</b> 053/054 for a two-month trial. This new SMRT Active Route Map Information System (STARiS) was then progressively introduced to all C151 trainsets, and subsequently to C651 and C751B trains for a cost of S$12 million—S$20,000 per car. It became standard equipment on all new rolling stocks subsequently introduced on the East-West Line and North-South Line.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 {{the second}} five {{locomotives}} of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form {{at an average}} cost of £11,323 each. They were painted in the same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal lining {{that had been a}} feature of the first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt lining along the sides of these coaches. A prototype <b>trainset</b> was built with such lining for exhibition in America, but it was never put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first <b>trainset</b> was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E
50|$|In June 2013 Skoda Transportation {{announced}} that it won a tender for 6 Push-pull <b>trainsets</b> for DB Regio including 6 109Es. The tender included a requirement for 190 km/h speed, as the <b>trainsets</b> will be used on the Nuremberg-Munich high-speed railway. <b>Trainsets</b> {{are expected to be}} delivered in 2016. These locomotives will be designated as DB Class 102.|$|R
5000|$|These single-level {{cars will}} be used to create two [...] "Comet car" [...] <b>trainsets</b> that will run between Oakland and Bakersfield. That will allow Caltrans to break up two bi-level [...] "California car" [...] <b>trainsets</b> to use the cars to add another coach car to each of the San Joaquin's {{remaining}} [...] "California Car" [...] <b>trainsets.</b>|$|R
