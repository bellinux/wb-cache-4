5|$|September 18, 1936- A Category2 {{hurricane}} {{parallels the}} Delmarva Peninsula, causing higher <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> tides at Lewes.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south <b>than</b> <b>usual,</b> {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler <b>than</b> <b>usual.</b> Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is {{situated}} between the lowlands of western Albania and the highlands of the interior, and has thus a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, though, (as is normal for Albania), much heavier rainfall <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> for this climate type.|$|E

30|$|REM sleep {{represented}} only 4 % of TST {{during the}} 24  h, which is lower <b>than</b> the <b>usual</b> rate in normal sleepers (15 – 20 %) [3]. N 3 sleep represented 9 % of TST, also lower <b>than</b> the <b>usual</b> percentage in normal sleepers (15 – 20 %) [2].|$|R
5|$|The engine can {{accommodate}} high-load operating conditions {{and has been}} designed for low-speed operation. It can carry up to 260kilograms. The hovercraft is equipped with GPS and the construction costs are lower <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> {{for this type of}} vehicle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, he {{embarked}} on a tour with the International Cavaliers, which toured Africa, mostly playing against provincial teams. He played in seven matches and had a productive series, scoring 541 runs at 41.54 including a century and four fifties. He also bowled more frequently <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> taking seven wickets at 53.29.|$|E
5|$|Audition {{was shot}} in {{approximately}} three weeks, which was about one more week <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> for Miike's films at the time. Scenes {{such as those in}} Asami's apartment and at a restaurant were shot on location in a real apartment and a real restaurant. Outdoor scenes were shot in Tokyo, along intersections in Omotesandō.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function {{in the presence of}} residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> intensity relative to the muscle's maximal capacity, enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using ligaments for stability, which enables greater mobility.|$|E
5|$|Project 28's {{objective}} was to enhance localization and development of warship construction industry in India. The navy asked the Indian industries to deliver equipment of higher sophistication levels <b>than</b> <b>usual.</b> This led to some unforeseen delays in the product delivery, and struggles perfecting the products.|$|E
5|$|Salmon {{agreed not}} to {{broadcast}} the episode at Christmas. It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000, forty minutes in length, rather <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The One Foot In The Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which {{looked back at the}} hit sitcom. The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Erin passed 105miles (170km) east-northeast of Bermuda, its closest {{approach to the}} island. The hurricane maintained peak strength for 18hours before slowly weakening. Its weakening trend was slower <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> due to warmer <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> water temperatures, and by late on September 10 Erin weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. Multiple short-wave troughs weakened the western portion of the subtropical ridge, and on September 11, Erin decelerated as it turned to the east. A strengthening mid- to upper-level trough over eastern Canada turned the hurricane to the northeast. It gradually accelerated its forward motion, and on September 15, after weakening to a strong tropical storm, Erin passed just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Convection gradually diminished as it moved through the north Atlantic Ocean, and later on September 15 Erin became extratropical. The extratropical storm continued northeastward, and after crossing over southern Greenland Erin merged with a high-latitude cyclonic flow {{to the east of}} Greenland on September 17.|$|E
5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia in 1907—08, {{like that}} which toured South Africa, faced {{questions}} about its strength. Because {{at least four}} first-choice players chose not to tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> for an Ashes series. The tourists lost the Tests 4–1, although Wisden suggested that the series was more competitive than suggested by the results.|$|E
5|$|The {{inversion}} prevented {{air pollutants}} from rising and trapped them within the city. The smog event itself started on Wednesday November 23, {{coinciding with the}} beginning of the long Thanksgiving weekend. The material sources of the smog were particulates and chemicals from factories, chimneys, and vehicles. Sulfur dioxide levels rose. Smoke shade, a measure of visibility interference in the atmosphere, was two to three times higher <b>than</b> <b>usual.</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton hired regular {{collaborator}} Danny Elfman, {{who had previously}} been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989. Elfman noted that his work on Planet of the Apes contained more percussion instruments <b>than</b> <b>usual.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E
5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer <b>than</b> <b>usual.</b> However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} from their losses at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at Cannae, with roughly 86,000 Roman and allied troops. They massed their heavy infantry in a deeper formation <b>than</b> <b>usual,</b> while Hannibal utilized the double-envelopment tactic. This {{was so successful}} that the Roman army was effectively destroyed as a fighting force. Following the defeat, Capua and several other Italian city-states defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch was smaller <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, {{to which the}} states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E
5|$|In a {{significant}} decrease from the previous episode, the episode was viewed in 6.21 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The 52nd Grammy Awards and the Pro Bowl aired simultaneously to the Animation Domination block, resulting in lower <b>than</b> <b>usual</b> ratings. Despite this, the episode also acquired a 3.2 rating in the 18–49 demographic, surpassing The Simpsons, American Dad! and The Cleveland Show, in both rating and total viewership.|$|E
