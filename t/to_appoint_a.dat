50|$|Under the {{independent}} counsel statute, majorities of either party within the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally request the attorney general <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>an</b> independent counsel on a particular matter, but the decision {{of whether or not}} <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> {{the independent}} counsel remained with the attorney general and was not reviewable in court. If the attorney general decided not <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>an</b> independent counsel in response to such a request, they were only required to respond in writing with the reasons. Although under the statute the attorney general made the decision of whether or not <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>an</b> independent counsel, the actual selection of the individual to serve in this role was made by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals.|$|R

Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.|$|E

50|$|The new {{administration}} regime {{introduced by the}} Enterprise Act 2002 replaces the previous situation where administrative receivership was available {{as an alternative to}} administration, which has traditionally been a more rescue-oriented insolvency regime. This regime allowed the holder of <b>a</b> floating charge <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>an</b> administrative receiver <b>to</b> realise assets in his favour, and also to block an administration order sought by a borrower. This was felt to be too favourable to the floating charge holder {{at the expense of other}} creditors. Holders of a floating charge created prior to 15 September 2003 retain their right <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>an</b> administrative receiver, but all purported rights to do so created after that date will be construed as rights <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>an</b> administrator (subject <b>to</b> certain specific, rare exceptions).|$|R

5|$|However, even {{following}} Romanum decet pontificem, {{only three}} of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal. The College of Cardinals apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>a</b> cardinal-nephew, who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant Niccolò Coscia. Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>a</b> new Whig administration.

Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Clark {{became the}} third {{president}} of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not become public knowledge until May.

The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) in the event that Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
