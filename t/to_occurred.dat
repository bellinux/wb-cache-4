2500|$|Al-Qaradawi {{has been}} a staunch critic of Salafism (Wahhabism). He says this group stems its roots from Saudi Arabia and is just 200-years-old since its {{establishment}} compared to Islam which have existed for over 1,400 years who've lived in peace and harmony with Christians, Jews and other faiths. He says this group was created by Saudi Arabia's founder Ibn Saud together with Salafi (Wahhabi) founder Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab whom was all from Najd (today Riyadh) {{with the help of}} British after toppling the legitimate Islamic Empire of Ottomans which was mainstream Sunni Islam at that time and that it also see the oust of Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca) who're the original Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in charge of Makkah's Al-Masjid al-Haram and Madinah's Al-Masjid an-Nabawi for over a thousand years since the time of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad whom is also the Prophet's direct descendant; the Hashemites, which now resides and rule over Jordan which have no natural resources and regarded as the poorest Arab countries in the Middle East. Qaradawi warns the world that it's Salafist (Wahhabist) that has caused terrorism all over the world especially groups like Islamic State, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Abu Sayyaf and other similar groups alike. He also said that Israel and America heavily exploits from these groups by funding them since the 1970s until the present-day to pursue their (Western) political agenda in controlling the vast wealth of oil, gas, coal and mine to further destabilized the natural-resource-rich Middle East and beyond. Qaradawi also said that if more terrorist attacks were <b>to</b> <b>occurred,</b> Israel will greatly benefit from it as it will give boosts to the sales of Israeli security companies and firms to promote their high-tech equipment globally in both hard and software forms. Qaradawi says the deceitful evil implications of those countries' complicity with this group is irreversible and has no end in sight. He compares them (takfiri groups) to dogs from Hell-fire for using religion to kill the innocents. He further says that Ash'aris, Maturidis can overcome their tiny existence. He issued a fatwa (edict) in 2014 denouncing the Islamic State (Daesh) declaration of [...] "caliphate" [...] and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as [...] "invalid, null and void" [...] from every aspect, every angle of the Islamic Sharia Law.|$|E
