2500|$|In the European context, safety {{effectiveness}} and quality is ensured through the [...] "Conformity Assessment" [...] that {{is defined as}} [...] "the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies {{with the requirements of}} the European Medical Device Directive". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, [...] the <b>technical</b> <b>file</b> and the quality system deliveries. [...] The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients {{for the use of the}} device. The <b>technical</b> <b>file</b> contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA <b>technical</b> <b>file</b> has similar content although organized in different structure. [...] The Quality System deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle. The same standard (ISO EN 13485) is usually applied for quality management systems in US and worldwide.|$|E

40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>files</b> {{are a very}} {{important}} part of the Argo dataset. They allow us to diagnose systematic faults and track array performance. In the past it was assumed that all DACs knew how these should be filled and we only needed to provide details as to the names and formats. With the development of Argo format version 3. 1 and the more detailed format checker, it would be useful to describe more fully how the <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> are generated and how their contents are determined. We therefore provide this user's guide to the <b>technical</b> <b>files...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{co-operation}} {{with the}} Dutch Inspectorate for Health Care, RIVM {{has developed a}} method for {{the enforcement of the}} Dutch Decree on medical devices under "Class I devices". This method was used for assessing the contents of <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> according to the requirements in the Decree. Manufacturers are legally bound to compile <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> as part of the conformity assessment procedure. The study included the development of a file evaluation form and a pilot study for examining 40 <b>technical</b> <b>files.</b> This method met the expectations, with minor adaptations being proposed. Of the 40 manufacturers, five withdrew their registrations leaving 35 files. Of these, 33 were received within 16 weeks and one later. None of these 34 files succeeded in meeting all the requirements. The number of shortcomings varied between 2 and 14. For 20 files, additional information for evaluating these files was requested. For 15 files, this information was received in time, allowing 29 files to be fully evaluated. The number of essential requirements that had been insufficiently addressed varied between 1 and 8 per file. All files had flaws in labelling and instructions for use. The results imply that most manufacturers participating in this study were familiar with the Decree. The quality of the <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> should be improved. This will stimulate a systematic evaluation of the safety and suitability aspects of devices to be put on the market...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>technical</b> <b>file</b> {{is usually}} {{based on a}} {{document}} archive system that ensures longevity of documents and can either be on paper or in electronic files.

50|$|The key {{difference}} in the recast {{is that it is}} now necessary to demonstrate conformity in a similar way to the LVD and EMC directives. Not being able to show compliance in sufficiently detailed files, and not ensuring it is implemented in production is now a criminal offence. Like the other CE marking directives it mandates production control and traceability to the <b>technical</b> <b>files.</b> It describes 2 methods of achieving presumption of conformity (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 16.2), either <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> should include test data for all materials or a standard accepted in the official journal for the directive, is used.

40|$|Dermal fillers, or just fillers, are {{products}} that are injected into or under the skin for medical or cosmetic purposes. This could be to restore the natural contours of the body after an operation for example, but also to mask the visible effects of ageing. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has compiled an overview of 26 so-called non-permanent fillers that were marketed in the Netherlands in 2014, and has analysed these products in a laboratory. The <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> of the 14 manufacturers of these products were also investigated. Following a request through professional associations, 67 treating professionals completed a questionnaire about the fillers that they use and about their potential side effects. All 26 products from 14 manufacturers proved to be harmless. In order to establish this, an internationally recognised laboratory test that measures harmful effects on cells was carried out. The composition of the products conforms with the description in the <b>technical</b> <b>files.</b> According to the treating professionals, the products from the 14 manufacturers cause very few side effects. The quality of key sections in the <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> of the 14 manufacturers varied. It is important that manufacturers ensure their <b>technical</b> <b>files</b> are kept in good order. By keeping complete and correct files, manufacturers underpin {{the safety of the}} product for the patient, although a limitation in the files does not lead directly to a substandard product. Two sets of files were incomplete, meaning that the safety of the product for the patient is not well substantiated. Most of the inadequacies in the files were of an administrative nature, and are not expected to have any influence on the safety of the product for the patient...|$|R
