50|$|Disposing of <b>the</b> {{dissected}} <b>body</b> was difficult, {{and over}} the years, rumors have appeared about how anatomists might have managed to do so. One possibility was secretly burying the remains behind their school, whilst another rumored possibility was that they gave <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> zoo keepers, as feed for carnivorous animals or burial beneath elephant grazing pens, or fed <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> vultures kept specifically for this purpose.|$|R
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{and other}} benzodiazepines may also cause the {{development}} of physical dependence, tolerance, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{metabolism}} sought {{to explain how}} food was processed by <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance.

40|$|A {{process of}} {{teleportation}} is here studied. It involves holography and {{reduction of the}} gravitational mass of <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> be transported.

25|$|On 30 April 2008, DNA {{tests were}} {{performed}} on <b>the</b> two <b>bodies.</b> A U.S. laboratory compared DNA from <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>to</b> a DNA sample given by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose first cousins, once removed were the Romanov children. The test confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> belonged <b>to</b> members of the imperial family: Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich and Grand Duchess Maria, according to Russian news agencies. Therefore, all the Romanovs have now been accounted for, disproving claims of survival.|$|R
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
5|$|Naltrexone is a {{competitive}} antagonist for opioid receptors, effectively blocking {{the effects of}} endorphins and opioids. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is {{a reduction in the}} pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol. Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking. Nalmefene also appears effective and works by a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was {{too weak}} to leave his bedroom.

Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> undertake the work for which they were originally bred.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent {{different parts of the}} body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E

5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin is quickly converted by <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken down in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid {{was found to}} activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
