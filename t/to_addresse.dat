The purpose {{of which is}} two fold: 1 To explore the notion of ‘creative play’ and encourage collaboration between different disciplines and practitioners {{in the delivery of}} specific workshops. 2. To develop a ‘donate a day’ scheme that allows academics, professional practitioners to get involved with the Voluntary Sector and Community projects that offer aspiration, and learning opportunities to disadvantaged groups and expand widening participation, effect the community and addresses social concerns. A varied array of approaches emerged depending on the mix and expertise of the practitioners. Collaboration between different disciplines and practitioners in the delivery of specific workshops is encouraged. Examples of individual projects: Roderick Mills teamed up with Camille Rousseu, designer Adam Ellison and Award winning designers/animators Martin and Line Andersen to do animation with homeless and disadvantaged children. Margarida Botelho's project, 'When the present me, meets the future me'. The ‘Donate a day’ scheme allows academics, and professional practitioners to get involved with the Voluntary Sector and community projects that offer aspiration, and learning opportunities to disadvantaged groups.

40|$|Recent {{results of}} Hartle-Hawking wave {{functions}} on asymptotic dS boundaries show non-normalizability, while the bulk origin is not clear. This paper attempts <b>to</b> <b>addresse</b> {{this problem by}} studying (Kerr-) dS_ 3 cosmology in Einstein gravity deformed by a minimally coupled scalar field. Various saddle-point contributions exp[i(saddle-point action) ] to the Hartle-Hawking wave functions are computed with mini-superspace formalism. The saddle-point actions are first obtained in the spacetime bulks by direct computation, then on the asymptotic dS boundary by holographic renormalization. It is found that the imaginary part of the saddle-point actions, as functions of scalar field deformation, are generally bounded in the bulk, but can diverge to -infty on the boundary. This can probably {{be a source of}} the scalar field-related non-normalizability of the boundary Hartle-Hawking wave functions. For Kerr-dS_ 3 cosmology, some saddle-point actions have imaginary parts diverging to -infty both in the bulk and on the boundary, when the boundary T^ 2 is stretched to infinitely long. This can be an origin of non-normalizability of the boundary Hartle-Hawking wave functions related to temperature divergence. Finally the holographic renormalization is extended to scalar-deformed dS_{d+ 1 } (d>= 3) cosmologies for the imaginary part of the saddle-point actions. The result is tested on a 5 d example, and saddle points leading to divergent contribution to the boundary Hartle-Hawking wave function are shown to exist.

The change in internal state manifests itself in many ways, but the two ways that concern us in this review are (i) the creation of internal stress arising from the strain incompatibility between grains and/or the formation of cell/sub-grain structures and (ii) {{a change in the}} material resistance. This review aims to provide a clear separation of these two concepts by exploring the origin of each term and how it is associated with the creep deformation mechanism. Experimental techniques used to measure the internal stress and internal resistance over different length-scales are critically reviewed.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} are {{a well-known}} technical problem because they {{add to the}} stress field induced by external loads, thus causing mechanical components to fail at a load level significantly lower than expected. Of the various techniques developed to measure them, the ring-core method {{is one of the}} few which in principle can be restarted (by removing the core and re-installing the strain gauge rosette). Thus, it is theoretically able to measure residual stress at significantly greater depth than other methods. Although the idea is interesting, its practical implementation is quite difficult: in particular, re-installing the rosette and re-wiring is almost impossible when depth becomes significant, thus the incremental measurement is more a theoretical possibility than a real experimental approach. In this work we propose to replace the strain gauge rosette with an optical (interferometric) technique. In this way the incremental approach becomes viable, although, depending on the optical technique used, some practical problems have <b>to</b> be <b>addresse...</b>|$|R

Organisational reform in Australia has resulted in a greater focus on relations between management and employees at organisational and workplace level. The stimulus has been the search for greater efficiency and productivity. Leaders in government, business and unions have agreed that improved human resource management (HRM) is pivotal, but such views have not necessarily been matched by the commitment of management attention, time and resources to HRM at the workplace.

40|$|Debates on how {{to deliver}} {{conservation}} benefits to communities living close to protected high-biodiversity areas have preoccupied conservationists for over 20 years. Tourism revenue sharing (TRS) has become a widespread policy intervention in Africa and elsewhere where charismatic populations of wildlife remain. This paper analyzes TRS policy at Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda, from a policy arrangements perspective. It is based on data collected at BINP and three surrounding parishes, using qualitative methods. It concludes that the governance capacity of the TRS policy arrangement at BINP is low due to the structural incongruence of {{the dimensions of the}} policy arrangement (analyzed in terms of actors, resources, rules of the game and discourses). Despite the participatory rhetoric of policy reforms, the Uganda Wildlife Authority remains the most powerful actor: it has control over resources and consequently determines the rules of the game. Local communities do not feel adequately compensated for conservation costs. This issue is exacerbated by weak communications with local people, problems of fair distribution locally and nationally, corruption claims and powerful local elites.

Our team applies classic and modern theory and techniques {{to the study}} of barnacle glue. Techniques include physical measures, bacteriology, behavior, physiology, biochemistry, microscopy, spectroscopy, tomography, tandem mass spectrometry, molecular biology and proteomics. Theory is grounded in evolution and previous literature. Here, we use data from these techniques to support the hypothesis that barnacle glue curing is similar toblood clotting and propose a model for how glue cures. Similar to blood clotting, barnacle glue curing involves enzymatic activation of precursors and rearrangement of structural molecules to form a crosslinked material. Barnacle larval settlement, bacteriology and biochemical data show glue contains large amounts of small peptides. Their role in glue curing has been overlooked. The peptides comprise 15 to 30 % of partially cured glue. Because they have little secondary structure, the peptides can associate with binding domains on the substrate and interface with the larger, well-described structural proteins known in barnacle glue. Enzymes participate in curing of barnacle glue. Siloxanes impact glue-curing enzymes. They potentiate trypsin activity and inhibit transglutaminase activity. Changing enzymeactivity impacts how glue cures. Disrupting the curing process of biological glues is central to effective cleaning strategies for fouling management. Thus silicones that interfere with enzyme activity have potential as additives in easy cleansurfaces.

In this paper, we show that linearly decryptable FHE schemes cannot be secure even in the ciphertext only security model. Then we consider the maximum security that a linearly decryptable FHE scheme could achieve. This paper designs fully homomorphic symmetric key encryption (FHE) schemes without bootstrapping (that is, noise-free FHE schemes). The proposed FHE schemes are based on quaternion/octonion algebra and Jordan algebra over finite rings Z_n and are secure in the weak ciphertext-only security model assuming the hardness of solving multivariate quadratic equation systems and solving univariate high degree polynomial equation systems in Z_n. It is up to our knowledge {{that this is the}} first noise-free FHE scheme that has ever been designed with a security proof (even in the weak ciphertext-only security model). It is argued that the weak ciphertext-only security model is sufficient for various applications such as privacy preserving computation in cloud. As an example, the proposed FHE schemes are used to construct obfuscated programs. This example could be further used to show that the scheme presented in this paper could be combined with existing FHE schemes with bootstrapping to obtain more efficient FHE schemes with bootstrapping in the fully CPA model. At the end of the paper, we point out the insecurity of several recently proposed noise-free FHE schemes. Comment: this paper has some issues <b>to</b> be <b>addresse...</b>|$|R

Little {{is known about}} patients' satisfaction with these treatment options. Moreover, the few available studies show methodological shortcomings. To answer the following questions: firstly, how satisfied are patients with psoriasis with their current treatment and does patients' satisfaction significantly differ between treatment types when controlling for demographic and clinical factors? Secondly, how important are specific domains of satisfaction to patients, and when taking perceived importance into account, which domains merit the most attention in improving quality of care? Members of the two existing Dutch associations for patients with psoriasis were invited to complete a web-based survey, which included a study-specific satisfaction questionnaire. A total of 1293 patients completed the survey (response rate 32 %). Overall, patients were moderately satisfied with their current treatment. Patients receiving topical treatment were significantly least satisfied; patients receiving biologic treatment were significantly most satisfied. Overall, patients rated 'treatment effectiveness' as most important, followed by 'treatment safety' and 'doctor-patient communication'. Domains with the highest 'room for improvement' scores were effectiveness of topical therapy, phototherapy and oral agents (but not biologic treatment), convenience of topical treatment and safety of systemic treatments (both oral agents and biologics).

40|$|Background: The actual {{burden and}} causative agent of tuberculous {{lymphadenitis}} (TBLN) cases {{is not well}} known {{due to lack of}} strong surveillance system and diagnostic facilities in Ethiopia. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of TBLN, its causative agent and risk factors for acquiring this infection. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2012 at four main hospitals and one diagnostic clinic located in northern Ethiopia. Fine needle aspirates (FNAs) from TBLN suspects were taken for acid fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy, culture and molecular typing. Results: Among 437 aspirates, culture yielded AFB in 226 (51. 7 %) of cases. Sixty one culture negative cases (30. 5 % of 200 cases) were positive by Xpert MTB/RIF test. Moreover, a rifampicin resistant AFB was detected from culture negative cases. The overall prevalence of FNAs positive TBLN cases was 65. 8 %. The BacT/AlerT 3 D system proved to be a more rapid method with higher recovery rate than Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) and/or Gottsacker media (P< 0. 0001). Molecular typing identified all culture positive isolates as M. tuberculosis. The main risk factors for TBLN were pediatric age (OR 2. 8, 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 7. 05) and cough (OR 2, 95 %CI, 1. 09 - 3. 7).

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the relation between alginate concentration and scaffold stiffness and find preparation conditions where the viscoelastic behaviour mimics that of the NP. In addition, we measured the effect of variations in scaffold stiffness on the expression of extracellular matrix molecules specific to the NP (proteoglycans and collagen) by native NP cells. We prepared sample discs of different concentrations of alginate (1 %- 6 %) by two different methods, diffusion and in situ gelation. The stiffness increased with increasing alginate concentration, while the loss tangent (dissipative behaviour) remained constant. The diffusion samples were ten-fold stiffer than samples prepared by in situ gelation. Sample discs prepared from 2 % alginate by diffusion closely matched the stiffness and loss tangent of the NP. The stiffness of all samples declined upon prolonged incubation in medium, especially for samples prepared by diffusion. The biosynthetic phenotype of native cells isolated from NPs was preserved in alginate matrices up to 4 weeks of culturing. Gene expression levels of extracellular matrix components were insensitive to alginate concentration and corresponding matrix stiffness, likely due to the poor adhesiveness of the cells to alginate. In conclusion, alginate can mimic the viscoelastic properties of the NP and preserve the biosynthetic phenotype of NP cells but certain limitations like long-term stability still have <b>to</b> be <b>addresse...</b>|$|R

Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is often required for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in severe FH. The objective {{of this study was}} to present the first experiences with LA in Malaysia, between 2004 and 2014. We retrospectively collected data from patient records to assess the effectiveness, adverse effects, patient quality of life, and costs associated with an LA service for genetically confirmed homozygous and heterozygous FH. We treated 13 women and 2 men aged 6 to 59 years, 10 with homozygous and 5 with heterozygous FH, all on maximally tolerated cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, for a total of 65 patient-years. Acute lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol post apheresis was 56. 3 ± 7. 2 %, with time-averaged mean lowering of 34. 9 ± 13. 9 %. No patients experienced any cardiovascular events during the period of receiving LA. Patients receiving LA experienced few side effects and enjoyed reasonable quality of life, but inability to continue treatment was frequent because of cost. LA for severe FH can be delivered effectively in the short term in developing nations, but costs are a major barrier to sustaining this mode of treatment for this high-risk group of patients. New drug therapies for FH, such as the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors, and apolipoprotein-B 100 antisense oligonucleotides may allow improved care for these patients, but costs and long-term safety remain as issues <b>to</b> be <b>addresse...</b>|$|R

Design: multi country qualitative interview study. Semi-structured interviews using open-ended questions and a patient scenario. Data were subjected to five-stage analytic framework approach (familiarisation, developing a thematic framework from the interview questions and emerging themes, indexing, charting and mapping to search for interpretations), with interviewers commenting on preliminary reports. Setting: primary care. Participants: 80 primary care clinicians randomly selected from primary care research networks based in nine European cities. Results: clinicians reported four main individual clinical factors that guided their antibiotic prescribing decision: auscultation, fever, discoloured sputum and breathlessness. These were considered alongside a general impression of the patient derived from building {{a picture of the}} illness course, using intuition and familiarity with the patient. Comorbidity and older age were considered main risk factors for poor outcomes. Clinical factors were similar across networks, apart from C reactive protein near patient testing in Tromsø.

Conclusions: clinicians emphasised the importance of auscultation, fever, discoloured sputum and breathlessness, general impression of the illness course, familiarity with the patient, comorbidity, and age in informing their antibiotic prescribing decisions for LRTI. As some of these factors may be overemphasised given the evolving evidence base, greater standardisation of assessment and integration of findings may help reduce unhelpful variation in management.

40|$|The 7 billion global {{population}} {{is projected to}} grow by 70 million per annum, increasing by 30 % to 9. 2 billion by 2050. This increased population density is projected to increase demand for food production by 70 % notably due to changes in dietary habits in developing countries towards high quality food, e. g. greater consumption of meat and milk products and to {{the increasing use of}} grains for livestock feed. The availability of additional agricultural land is limited. Any expansion will happen mostly at the expense of forests and the natural habitats containing wildlife, wild relatives of crops and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, more agricultural land will be used to produce bio-based commodities such as biofuel or fibre instead of food. Thus, we need to grow food on even less land, with less water, using less energy, fertiliser and pesticide than we use today. Given these limitations, sustainable production at elevated levels is urgently needed. The reduction of current yield losses caused by pests is a major challenge to agricultural production. This review presents (1) worldwide crop losses due to pests, (2) estimates of pesticide-related productivity, and costs and benefits of pesticide use, (3) approaches to reduce yield losses by chemical, as well as biological and recombinant methods of pest control and (4) the challenges of the crop-protection industry. The general public has a critical function in determining the future role of pesticides in agriculture. However, {{as long as there is}} a demand for pesticide-based solutions to pest control problems and food security concerns, the externality problems associated with the human and environmental health effects of pesticides need also <b>to</b> be <b>addresse...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Although {{many studies}} have been {{conducted}} in the telepathology field in recent years, a systematic review that examines studies in a comparative manner has not yet been undertaken. This paper aims to review the published papers on telepathology projects and compare them in several aspects such as telepathology method,telecommunication method, clinical outcome, etc. Method: This is a systematic review study. PubMed database was used to find the studies published in the past ten years (2004 – 2014). The 71 final related papers were evaluated. Data were extracted from these studies based on the following items: country, national (in country) or international (between countries), frozen section or slide, body part, type of camera used, telecommunication method, telepathology method, clinical outcome, cost evaluation, satisfaction evaluation and the description of consultation providers and receivers. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results: Results showed that most of the studies were performed in developed countries on a national level, on slide and on a specific body part. In most studies, a Nikon camera was used to take images. Online methods were the most used telecommunication method in the studies, while store and forward was the most used telepathology method. Clinical outcome of many studies showed that telepathology is a reliable and accurate method for consultation. More than half of the studies considered the cost, and most of them showed that a telepathology system is cost effective. Few studies evaluated satisfaction of the participants. In most studies, the telepathology project was undertaken between pathologists. Conclusion: Although there is enough evidence to suggest that telepathology is an effective way of consultation between pathologists, there are still some areas that should be addressed and for which {{there is a lack of}} convincing evidence. For example, pathologist satisfaction, cost evaluation, legal issues and ethical issues still need <b>to</b> be <b>addresse...</b>|$|R
