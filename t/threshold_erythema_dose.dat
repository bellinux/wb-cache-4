40|$|The {{influence}} of UVA and visible radiation on the acute damage by {{short-wave ultraviolet radiation}} (UVR) (Î» < 320 nm) was investigated in human volunteers, using delayed erythema and sunburn cell production as markers of injury. It was found that subsequent exposure to UVA + visible radiation produced a significant reduction of the <b>threshold</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> by short-wave UVR, in a dose-dependent manner. Subsequent exposures to varying doses of UVA + visible radiation, {{as well as to}} visible light alone failed to influence sunburn cell production. It is concluded that there is a positive interaction between short-wave UVR and UVA in the induction of delayed erythema, but this may not apply to epidermal cell injury. Photorecovery was not observed...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{exposures}} to subliminal doses of UVR, given at 24 -hr intervals, {{resulted in a}} lowering of the <b>erythema</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>dose.</b> At erythemogenically equivalent doses, UV-A was {{the most effective and}} UV-C the least. A similar and more pronounced effect was observed following repeated {{exposures to}} subthreshold doses of UV-A and topically applied 8 -methoxypsoralen. These findings provide quantitative evidence for the cumulative nature of acute UVR damage in human skin...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Safe {{systemic}} {{protection from}} the health hazards of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight is desirable. Green tea is consumed globally and {{is reported to have}} anti-inflammatory properties, which may be mediated through the impact on cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Recent data suggest that green tea catechins (GTCs) reduce acute UVR effects, but human trials examining their photoprotective potential are scarce. OBJECTIVE: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine whether GTCs protect against clinical, histologic, and biochemical indicators of UVR-induced inflammation. DESIGN: Healthy adults (aged 18 - 65 y, phototypes I-II) were randomly allocated to 1350 mg encapsulated green tea extract (540 mg GTC) with 50 mg vitamin C or placebo twice daily for 3 mo. Impact on skin erythema, dermal leukocytic infiltration, and concentrations of proinflammatory eicosanoids was assessed after solar-simulated UVR challenge, and subject compliance was determined through assay of urinary GTC metabolite epigallocatechin glucuronide. RESULTS: Volunteers were assigned to the active (n = 25) or the placebo (n = 25) group. After supplementation, median (IQR) sunburn <b>threshold</b> (minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose)</b> was 28 (20 - 28) and 20 (20 - 28) mJ/cm(2) in the active and placebo groups, respectively (nonsignificant), with no difference in AUC analysis for measured erythema index after a geometric series of 10 UVR doses. Skin immunohistochemistry showed increased neutrophil and CD 3 (+) T-lymphocyte numbers post-UVR in both groups (P < 0. 01) with no statistically significant differences between groups after supplementation. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites prostaglandin E 2 (vasodilator) and 12 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoicacid (chemoattractant), respectively, increased after UVR (P < 0. 05), with no differences between supplementation groups. CONCLUSION: Oral GTC 1080 mg/d with vitamin C over 3 mo did not significantly reduce skin erythema, leukocyte infiltration, or eicosanoid response to UVR inflammatory challenge. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials. gov as NCT 01032031...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{demonstrate}} quantitatively and graphically {{the way in which}} suberythemogenic doses of broadband UVA and UVB interact in producing a visible erythema. On the backs of fair-skinned human volunteers the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) was determined for polychromatic UVA and UVB. Increasing fractions of the UVA MED were given to sites already exposed to various fractions of the UVB MED resulting in sites exposed to various doses of both UVA and UVB. The same experiment was repeated with the order of wave- bands reversed. It was demonstrated that when UVA was followed by UVB an erythema was produced in those sites where the sum of the fractions was equal to one, an interaction termed photoaddition. When the UVA exposure followed the UVB, erythema was again predominantly noted in those sites demonstrating photoaddition. However, in the latter case, numerous sites of <b>threshold</b> <b>erythema</b> were noted where the sum of the fractions was greater than one. This is suggestive of photorecovery. No evidence of photoaugmentation was observed with either order of exposure...|$|R

40|$|For fair Caucasian skin, {{the minimal}} delayed <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) 24 hr after {{exposure}} to broadband UVA is about 1200 {{times greater than}} the MED of broadband UVB, for both single and multiple daily exposures. Repeated daily exposure to doses less than MED results in cumulative effects manifest by gradual lowering of the daily <b>dose</b> <b>threshold</b> for delayed <b>erythema</b> and pigmentation induced by UVA or UVB. At threshold doses, UVB is more erythemogenic than melanogenic; the opposite is true for UVA. Repeated daily UVA exposure greatly enhances melanogenesis such that markedly suberythemogenic exposure doses of UVA result in true melanogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ingestion of {{multiple}} antioxidants {{may result in}} synergistic increases in skin protection. Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, controlled study, the authors evaluated the effect of an antioxidant combination product in women with mild-to-moderate photoaging over 20 weeks. Changes on Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity levels and Minimal <b>Erythema</b> <b>Dose</b> were measured throughout the study. Results: Both Minimal <b>Erythema</b> <b>Dose</b> and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity levels increased in women receiving the antioxidant combination product, with the difference from baseline being statistically significant as early as Week 4. Similar findings were observed in women who received the control product, which had modest antioxidant activity. The comparisons {{between the two groups}} were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Oral ingestion of a combination of antioxidants can lead to improvement on objective measurements, such as Minimal <b>Erythema</b> <b>Dose</b> and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity levels, when compared to baseline values...|$|R
40|$|After {{ultraviolet}} exposure Langerhans cells (epidermal CD 1 a+ cells) {{disappear from}} the healthy skin, and CD 11 b+ macrophage-like cells, which are reported to produce interleukin- 10, appear {{in a matter of}} days. These phenomena are related to the ultraviolet-induced local suppression of contact hypersensitivity reactions. A defect in this suppression might allow inadvertent immune reactions to develop after ultraviolet (over) exposure; i. e., it could cause ultraviolet-B-induced polymorphous light eruption. In order to test this we first exposed buttock skin of eight healthy volunteers to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> from Philips TL 12 lamps, and indeed observed a dramatic disappearance of CD 1 a+ cells 48 and 72 [*]h later, at which time the number of CD 11 b+ cells increased in the dermis, and some occurred in the epidermis. The epidermis thickened and showed large defects, filled by CD 11 b+ cells, just below the stratum corneum. In 10 patients with polymorphous light eruption (five with a normal minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> and five with a low minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose)</b> CD 1 a+ cells were present in the epidermis {{as well as in the}} dermis before exposure. Strikingly, these cells were still present in considerable number at 48 and 72 [*]h after exposure to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses.</b> CD 11 b+ cells already present in the dermis before ultraviolet exposure, increased after ultraviolet exposure, and subsequently also invaded the epidermis. Despite the six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses,</b> there were no apparent defects in the epidermis of the polymorphous light eruption patients. This deviant early response to ultraviolet radiation is likely to be of direct relevance to the polymorphous light eruption and is perhaps useful as a diagnostic criterion...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observations}} and theories implicating {{long-wave ultraviolet radiation}} (320 - 400 nm) as the stimulus for various phenomena in human skin have prompted us to investigate the erythemogenic properties of middle (UV-B) and long (UV-A) wave ultraviolet light combinations. The backs of fair-skinned human volunteers were irradiated with varying doses of UV-A and UV-B to determine the minimal perceptible <b>erythema</b> (MPE) <b>dose</b> {{in each of these}} wavelength regions. The subjects then received overlapping suberythemal doses of UV-A and UV-B in each of several sites. When UV-A was held constant and UV-B was varied, the observed breakpoint dose (energy at which MPE was seen in doubly irradiated sites) quantitatively demonstrated an additive phenomenon. When combined energies approach <b>threshold</b> <b>erythema</b> values, the known erythemogenic properties of high-dose UV-A are additive to the subclinical or visible erythema induced by UV-B...|$|R
40|$|Sunscreens prevent sunburn and {{may also}} prevent skin cancer by {{protecting}} from ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. We assessed the ability of two sunscreens, with different spectral profiles, to inhibit DNA photodamage in human epidermis in situ. One formulation contained the established ultraviolet B filter octyl methoxycinnamate, whereas the other contained terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, a new ultraviolet A filter. Both formulations had sun protection factors of 4 when assessed with solar simulating radiation in volunteers of skin type I/II. We tested the hypothesis that sun protection factors would indicate the level of protection against DNA photodamage. Thus, we exposed sunscreen-treated sites to four times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of solar simulating radiation, whereas vehicle and control sites were exposed to one minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose.</b> We used monoclonal antibodies against thymine dimers and 6 â 4 photoproducts and image analysis to quantify DNA damage in skin sections. A dose of four times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose,</b> with either sunscreen, resulted in comparable levels of thymine dimers and 6 â 4 photoproducts to one minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> Â± vehicle, providing evidence that the DNA protection factor {{is comparable to the}} sun protection factor. The lack of difference between the sunscreens indicates similar action spectra for erythema and DNA photodamage and that erythema is a clinical surrogate for DNA photodamage that may lead to skin cancer...|$|R

40|$|When {{treating}} psoriasis, various topical emollients {{exist that}} can affect the penetration of ultraviolet radiationin phototherapy. Compared with normal-appearing skin with a reflectance of 4 % to 5 %, psoriatic skin hashigher reflectance {{as a result of}} its increased air-to-corneocyte interfaces. Studies have tested the effect ofemollients on light penetration by assessing psoriatic plaque clearance, differences in minimal erythemadose, and physical properties of the emollient (eg, monochromatic protection factor and absorbance). Psoriatic plaque clearance was found to improve with serous (thin liquid) -based emollients (eg, Vaseline oil[Unilever, Blackfriars, London, UK], mineral oil, and glycerol), whereas clearance decreased with salicylic acid and viscous-based emollients (eg, petrolatum). Emollients with high ultraviolet absorbance properties increased minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose,</b> and those with low absorbance properties decreased minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose.</b> Interestingly, when a liquid emollient with a refractive index close to that of normal appearing skin was applied, there was a net increase in light absorption, or a reduction in reflection that exceeded the emollient's innate ability to absorb light...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the photoprotective properties of induced pigmentation using erythema and epidermal DNA photodamage as endpoints. Previously unexposed buttock skin of 12 young, healthy adults (six skin type II and six skin type IV) was exposed daily (Monday to Friday) for 2 wk (days 1 â 12) with 0. 65 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of solar simulated radiation. Mean skin type IV minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> was 1. 8 -fold greater than for skin type II. Compared to skin type II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in skin type IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0. 65 and 2 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose)</b> showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm 2) independent of skin type. Our data also showed that DNA photodamage accumulates in both skin types with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in skin type IV than skin type II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in skin type IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both skin types. This provides further indirect evidence that DNA is a chromophore for erythema, but also suggests that a tan {{may not be the}} major factor in natural photoprotection...|$|R

40|$|As DNA damage {{induced by}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation plays {{an essential role}} in skin cancer induction, we pursued the measure of several DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet radiation in human skin for determining the efficacy of different topical photoprotectors. Non-exposed skin (buttocks from 20 individuals) was exposed to 10 doses of ultraviolet, which corresponded to three to four minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of solar-simulating radiation, and biopsies were taken at 24 h within the half and one minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> sites and a nonirradiated, adjacent control area. We report that even suberythemal doses of ultraviolet radiation are capable of inducing substantial DNA damage, namely pyrimidine dimers, p 53 induction, and the DNA base-modified product generated by oxidative stress, 8 -hydroxy- 2 â²-deoxyguanosine. All three lesions are induced in a dose-dependent manner. An additional eight individuals were treated with either ultraviolet B or ultraviolet B + ultraviolet A sunblock (sun protection factor 15) and exposed to 7 Â½ and 15 times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> on each individual, with biopsies taken at 24 h post-ultraviolet. Pyrimidine dimer and p 53 expression were rarely seen in nonirradiated skin but occasional staining was seen in all normal skin for 8 -hydroxy- 2 â²-deoxyguanosine. Applications of sunscreens to human skin before irradiation were shown to attenuate erythema but did not completely eliminate all three types of cellular damage when tested up to their sun protection factor 15. Furthermore, ultraviolet B + ultraviolet A sunscreens were less efficient than the ultraviolet B alone formulation for protection against all three lesions. These results suggest that DNA damage assessed in vivo by immunohistochemistry provides a very sensitive endpoint for determining the efficacy or photosensitivity of possible different protective measures in human skin...|$|R
40|$|The sunburn {{response}} is markedly reduced by dietary fish oil rich in Ï- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Because prostaglandins mediate the vasodilatation, {{we examined the}} effect of fish oil on ultraviolet (UV) B-induced prostaglandin metabolism. In addition we assessed the potential photoprotective effect of fish oil in light-sensitive patients. Thirteen patients with polymorphic light eruption received dietary supplements of fish oil rich in Ï- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for 3 months. At baseline and 3 months, the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of UVB irradiation was determined, and a graded UVA challenge given to a forearm to assess the threshold dose for papule provocation. Suction blisters were raised on the other forearm, on control skin, and on skin irradiated with four times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of UVB 24 h previously, and blister fluid prostaglandin E 2 was measured by radioimmunoassay. Following 3 months of fish oil, the mean minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of UVB irradiation increased from 19. 8 Â± 2. 6 to 33. 8 Â± 3. 7 mJ/cm 2 (mean Â± SEM), p < 0. 01. The UVA provocation test was positive in 10 patients at baseline, and after 3 months nine of these showed reduced sensitivity to papule provocation, p < 0. 001. Before fish oil, PGE 2 increased from 8. 6 (SEM 2. 1) ng/ml in control skin to 27. 2 (11) ng/ml after UVB, p < 0. 01. Following 3 months of fish oil, PGE 2 decreased to 4. 1 (1) and 9. 6 (2. 4) ng/ml in control and irradiated skin, respectively, p < 0. 05. Reduction of UV-induced inflammation by fish oil may be due, at least partially, to lowered prostaglandin E 2 levels.

40|$|Azathioprine is {{associated}} with enhanced skin photosensitivity to ultraviolet A (UVA) and leads to incorporation of 6 -thioguanine (6 -TG) into DNA of dividing cells. Unlike canonical DNA, 6 -TG DNA is damaged by UVA, which comprises more than 90 % of the ultraviolet reaching earth. Skin photosensitivity to UVA and UVB was measured in 48 kidney transplant patients immunosuppressed either by azathioprine (n = 32) or mycophenolate (n = 16). In 23 patients, azathioprine was subsequently replaced by mycophenolate and skin photosensitivity, DNA 6 -TG content in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}}, and susceptibility to UVA-induced DNA damage were monitored for up to 2 years. The mean minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> to UVA on azathioprine was twofold lower than on mycophenolate.

P 53 protein expression in irradiated skin indicated reduced susceptibility to UVA-induced DNA damage. 6 -TG DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained measurable for over 2 years.

In addition, all individuals were exposed to a (challenge) dose of three times the initial minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> on a small area of skin before the first and after the final exposure. On both occasions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were quantified in biopsies. As expected, repeated ultraviolet exposures resulted in increased epidermal pigmentation and thickness.

In a second set of experiments, with a group of 13 subjects, DNA repair kinetics were assessed. Within a period of 5 d after a single, slightly erythemal dose (1. 2 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose),</b> levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and p 53 -expressing cells were determined in skin biopsies.

40|$|Pigmentary {{phenotype}} {{is a key}} {{determinant of}} an individual's response to ultraviolet radiation {{with the presence of}} phaeomelanin thought to be of particular importance. Reports of minimal erythema testing, however, have failed to show a consistent difference between skin type I and other skin types. The melanocortin 1 receptor is a key genetic determinant of the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation. In this study we investigate the relation between experimentally induced erythemal response to ultraviolet radiation and the melanocortin 1 receptor genotype. Phototesting was performed in 20 redheads and 20 nonredheaded subjects, the majority of whom were also screened for the presence of melanocortin 1 receptor variants. The majority of redheads sequenced (89 %) had two melanocortin 1 receptor variants previously found to be associated with red hair compared to none of the controls.

Objective measurements of ultraviolet-B-induced erythema were performed using reflectance instrument measurements of erythema intensity and doseâresponse curves constructed for each subject. The slope of the doseâresponse curve in the redheaded group was statistically greater than in the nonredheaded group (median in redheads 4. 08 vs 3. 56 for controls, 95 % confidence interval for the difference between the medians being 0. 01 â 1. 23, p = 0. 043).

40|$|Ultraviolet B {{radiation}} can suppress cellular immunity. One of {{the mechanisms}} {{related to this}} immunosuppression is the disappearance of Langerhans cells from the epidermis. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the mechanism of ultraviolet B-induced Langerhans cell disappearance in healthy individuals. The two most likely mechanisms for Langerhans cell disappearance are apoptosis and migration. Apoptosis was assessed in vivo by exposing buttock skin of 10 healthy volunteers to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of ultraviolet B. Only very few apoptotic Langerhans cells could be observed in sections from the ultraviolet B-exposed skin. Migration of Langerhans cells cannot be established in skin sections and suction blisters were therefore raised in an attempt to trap migrating Langerhans cells in the sub-basal membrane blister fluid. Blisters were raised on the flexor side of the lower arm of 30 healthy volunteers at several time points after exposure of the skin to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of ultraviolet B. Blister fluid was collected and blister roofs were removed to check for Langerhans cell disappearance. Langerhans cells were detected in the blister fluid of the ultraviolet B-exposed skin and not of the unexposed skin. The number of Langerhans cells in the blister fluid peaked at about 18 h after ultraviolet exposure, which coincided with the largest depletion of Langerhans cells in the blister roof. A fraction (20 â 30 %) of the Langerhans cells in the blister fluid stained positive for DNA damage (cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers), showing that they originated from the epidermis.

Mice were exposed to suberythemal doses of UV before assessing local and systemic immunosuppression and tolerance to a contact sensitizer. Using a UV protocol that induced local but not systemic immunosuppression or tolerance in BALB/c mice, it was shown that Padimate O made the immunosuppression worse, whereas 2 -EHMC and MTD protected the immune system. When the cumulative dose was increased by 12. 7 %, causing systemic immunosuppression and tolerance, none of the sunscreens protected from inimunosuppression, but 2 -EHMC provided partial, and MTD gave complete protection from tolerance. To examine this apparent lack of protection from systemic immunosuppression, C 3 H/HeJ mice were used. These mice had a minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> {{similar to that of}} the BALB/c mice but were systemically immunosuppressed, with only 44 % of the UV dose required to immunosuppress BALB/c mice. 2 -EHMC provided some protection, whereas MTD provided complete protection from systemic immunosuppression in C 3 H/HeJ mice. Hence, sunscreens can protect from local and systemic immunosuppression, although this protection is limited and is not related to the sun protection factor of the sunscreens or the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of the mouse strain. Instead, protection seems to be related to the sunscreens' having a broad absorption spectrum...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a randomized trial designed to calculate human in vivo immune protection factors of two sunscreen preparations {{in a model}} of ultraviolet-induced local suppression of the induction of contact hypersensitivity to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene. Seventy-five male subjects were exposed in a multistage study to multiples of their individual minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation with or without protection by an ultraviolet B sunscreen (sun protection factor 5. 2) or a broad-spectrum ultraviolet A+B sun-screen (sun protection factor 6. 2). After 24 h subjects were sensitized with 50 Î¼L of 0. 0625 % 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene on a nonirradiated or ultraviolet-irradiated field on the buttock that was unprotected or protected by sunscreen. Three weeks after sensitization the subjects were challenged with varying concentrations of 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene on their upper inner arm, and the contact hypersensitivity response was determined at 48 and 72 h based on a semiquantitative clinical score, contact hypersensitivity lesion diameters, and dermal skin edema measurement by 20 MHz ultrasound. The 50 % immunosuppressive dose ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 79 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose,</b> depending on the endpoint parameter. Both sunscreens offered significant immunoprotection (p= 0. 014 â 0. 002) and their immune protection factor ranged from 4. 5 to 5. 8 (ultraviolet B sunscreen) and from 7. 7 to 11 (ultraviolet A+B sun-screen). The immune protection factor of the ultraviolet B sunscreen {{was similar to the}} sun protection factor (5. 2), whereas the sunscreen with broad-spectrum ultraviolet A+B protection exhibited better immunoprotective capacity than predicted from the sun protection factor...|$|R
40|$|Minimal <b>Erythema</b> <b>Dose</b> is a {{valuable}} guideline to determine the UVB dose required by patients. We undertook this pilot study to determine MED in 15 patients with psoriasis and found it to range from 45 mj to 235 mj {{with a mean of}} 89 mj. We attempted to correlate the MED with the individual occupation and skin colour. Higher MED was observed in dark skinned people as against moderately pigmented patients (p &# 60;. 05). Higher MED was also observed in patients with outdoor occupation as against patients with indoor occupation (p &# 60;. 01). The importance of determination of MED and the significance of its wide range in our patients is discussed...|$|R
