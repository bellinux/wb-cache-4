5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} democracy of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration {{rests with the}} elected representatives of the people which are <b>the</b> <b>ministers.</b> But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> lay down the policy and {{it is for the}} civil servants to carry out this policy.|$|E
5|$|On the {{diplomatic}} front, <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> of foreign nations, {{gathered in the}} open harbor of Hyōgo (present day Kobe) in early February, issued a declaration according to which the Shogunate was still considered the only rightful government in Japan, giving hope to Tokugawa Yoshinobu that foreign nations (especially France) might consider an intervention in his favour. A few days later however an Imperial delegation visited <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> declaring that the Shogunate was abolished, that harbours would be open in accordance with International treaties, and that foreigners would be protected. <b>The</b> <b>ministers</b> finally decided to recognize the new government.|$|E
5|$|Under Articles102 and 148 of the Constitution, the Brazilian Armed Forces were {{subordinate}} to the Emperor as Commander-in-Chief. He was aided by <b>the</b> <b>Ministers</b> of War and Navy in matters concerning the Army and the Armada (Navy)—although the President of the Council of Ministers usually exercised oversight of both branches in practice. <b>The</b> <b>ministers</b> of War and Navy were, with few exceptions, civilians.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|In 204 BC or {{the spring}} of 203 BC, Philip was {{approached}} by Sosibius and Agathocles of Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> of the young pharaoh Ptolemy V. <b>The</b> <b>ministers</b> sought to arrange a marriage between Ptolemy and Philip's daughter in order to form an alliance against Antiochus III the Great, emperor of the Seleucid Empire, who was seeking to expand his empire at Egypt's expense. Philip, however, declined the proposal and {{in the winter of}} 203 BC-202 BC, he formed an alliance with Antiochus and organised the partition of the Ptolemaic Empire. Philip agreed to help Antiochus to seize Egypt and Cyprus, while Antiochus promised to help Philip take control of Cyrene, the Cyclades and Ionia.|$|E
5|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>ministers</b> heading congregations in {{the area}} {{attended}} the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited.
