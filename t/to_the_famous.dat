5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, as well as courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a high standard, as in Aspasia's case), having independence, and paying taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a vivid figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur genera to have been named, {{numerous}} species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain as valid.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Lao She {{introduced}} Xin Fengxia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> playwright Wu Zuguang.

They married that year, {{despite the fact that}} they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied painting with Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter.|$|E

5|$|In 615, some of Muhammad's {{followers}} {{emigrated to}} the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony {{under the protection of}} the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Ibn Sa'ad mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to Hijra, while a second group rejoined them in Medina. Ibn Hisham and Tabari, however, only talk about one migration to Ethiopia. These accounts agree that Meccan persecution {{played a major role in}} Muḥammad's decision to suggest that a number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> letter of ʿUrwa preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as Umar and Hamzah converted.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light of his relationship by marriage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E
5|$|The Andriyivskyy Descent {{also has}} a number of {{monument}}s.

Another main monument on the street is dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko, located {{to the right of the}} monument to Yaroslav the Wise.
