40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} causes {{cancer and}} non-cancer health effects, {{each of which}} differs greatly {{in the shape of}} the doseâ€“response curve, latency, persistency, recurrence, curability, fatality and impact on quality of life. In recent decades, for dose limitation purposes, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has divided such diverse effects into <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> (formerly termed non-stochastic and deterministic effects) and stochastic effects. On the one hand, effective dose limits aim to reduce the risks of stochastic effects (cancer/heritable effects) and are based on the detriment-adjusted nominal risk coefficients, assuming a linear-non-threshold dose response and a dose and dose rate effectiveness factor of 2. On the other hand, equivalent dose limits aim to avoid <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> (vision-impairing cataracts and cosmetically unacceptable non-cancer skin changes) and are based on a threshold dose. However, the boundary between these two categories is be-coming vague. Thus, we review the changes in radiation effect classification, dose limitation concepts, and the definition of detriment and threshold. Then, the current situation is overviewed focusing on (i) stochastic effects with a threshold, (ii) <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> without a threshold, (iii) target organs/tissues for circulatory disease, (iv) dose levels for limitation of cancer risks vs prevention of non-life-threatening <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> vs prevention of life-threatening <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions,</b> (v) mortality or incidence of thyroid cancer, and (vi) the detri-ment for <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions.</b> For future discussion, one approach is suggested that classifies radiation effects according to whether effects are life threatening, and radiobiological research needs are also briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study assesses soft <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> and implant {{stability}} of 1, 132 percutaneous titanium implants (970 patients) for bone conduction devices (BCDs). In addition, it examines BCD usage and comparisons between different patient groups. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective survey. Mean follow-up time of 4. 6 years. SETTING: Tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: The surveyed cohort {{was divided into}} 3 different age groups (children, adults, and the elderly). In addition, 4 groups with variable loading times (i. e., the time between placement of the implant and loading the BCD sound processor) were identified {{as well as a}} subgroup of patients with mental retardation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Soft <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> around the percutaneous implants as classified by the Holgers grading system, implant failure, and revision surgery rates. RESULTS: In 95. 5 % of the 7, 415 observations of 1, 132 implants, there were no adverse soft <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions.</b> Implant loss was 8. 3 %. Significantly more soft <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> and implant failures were observed in children compared with adults and the elderly (p < 0. 05). Implant survival was lower in patients with mental retardation compared with patients without mental retardation (p = 0. 001). The loading time did not influence the occurrence of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> and implant survival rates. CONCLUSION: Children and patients with mental retardation are the most vulnerable to soft <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> and implant losses. Additional and more frequent care needs to be given during outpatient consultations. Because loading as early as 3 to 5 weeks did not negatively affect skin reactions or implant survival, full BCD installation can occur earlier without risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{function}} of chronic brain machine interfaces depends on stable electrical contact between neurons and electrodes. A key {{step in the}} development of interfaces is therefore to identify implant configurations that minimize adverse long-term <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions.</b> To this end, we here characterized the separate and combined effects of implant size and fixation mode at 6 and 12 weeks post implantation in rat (n = 24) cerebral cortex. Neurons and activated microglia and astrocytes were visualized using NeuN, ED 1 and GFAP immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. The contributions of individual experimental variables to the tissue response were quantified. Implants tethered to the skull caused larger <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> than un-tethered implants. Small diameter (50 Âµm) implants elicited smaller <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> and resulted in the survival of larger numbers of neurons than did large diameter (200 Âµm) implants. In addition, tethering resulted in an oval-shaped cavity, with a cross-section area larger than that of the implant itself, and in marked changes in morphology and organization of neurons in the region closest to the tissue interface. Most importantly, for implants that were both large diameter and tethered, glia activation was still ongoing 12 weeks after implantation, as indicated by an increase in GFAP staining between week 6 and 12, while this pattern was not observed for un-tethered, small diameter implants. Our findings therefore clearly indicate that the combined small diameter, un-tethered implants cause the smallest <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R
30|$|Local soft-tissue {{reactions}} {{have been}} observed {{as a result of}} corrosion debris produced at the trunnion [19, 20]. The clinical and histological appearance seen in periprosthetic <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> surrounding corroded trunnions {{is similar to that of}} adverse local <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> (ALTRs) seen in defective metal-on-metal (MoM) [21, 22] and non-MoM [22, 23] bearings. Adverse biologic reactions related to metal components include necrosis, lymphocytosis, vasculitis, and production of exudates, pseudotumors, or sinuses [24 â€“ 26]. Pseudotumors, which are non-malignant soft-tissue growths due to particulate debris irritation [27], have a histological appearance reflecting that of metal wear reactions and metal hypersensitivity. Many reports describing ALTRs note the use of implants containing cobalt, a metal that is known to have a more deleterious effect on macrophages compared to other metals found in implants [28]. These distinct <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> have also been termed adverse reaction to metal debris (ARMD) [29] or aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesions (ALVAL) [21].

Recently, we demonstrated that macrophages (MO) and T cells play key roles in these reactions. Since immunological studies showed that the T cell-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates MO, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility of modulating <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> to biodegradable biomaterials by inactivating IFN-gamma. Dermal sheep collagen (DSC) was used as a test biomaterial. DSC impregnated with anti-IFN-gamma or phosphate-buffered saline (control) was implanted in rats.

In the treated DSC, some huge giant cells were formed at the interface but association with the DSC bundles did not occur. Finally, in both the control and treated DSC, T cells and NK cells were rarely detected. This study demonstrates that IFN-gamma plays an important role in the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials. This reaction can be modulated by anti-IFN-gamma, which warrants further studies of anti-IFN-gamma for clinical application to prevent unwanted <b>tissue</b> <b>reactions</b> to biomaterials.

One hypothesis to account for this behavior is that the migration mimics an intermediate host, which would be required for juveniles of an ancestral form to develop to the third stage.
