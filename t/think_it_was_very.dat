500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> quick, like {{right out of the}} gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Pong {{attracted}} the attention of Ralph Baer, the inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey, and his employer, Sanders Associates. Sanders had an agreement with Magnavox to handle the Odyssey's sublicensing, which included dealing with infringement on its exclusive rights. However, Magnavox had not pursued legal action against Atari and numerous other companies that released Pong clones. Sanders continued to apply pressure, and in April 1974 Magnavox filed suit against Atari, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway and Chicago Dynamics. Magnavox argued that Atari had infringed on Baer's patents and his concept of electronic ping-pong based on detailed records Sanders kept of the Odyssey's design process dating back to 1966. Other documents included depositions from witnesses and a signed guest book that demonstrated Bushnell had played the Odyssey's table tennis game prior to releasing Pong. In response to claims that he saw the Odyssey, Bushnell later stated that, [...] "The fact is that I absolutely did see the Odyssey game and I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> clever." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were rewritten {{to convey}} Jackson's {{feelings}} about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. It {{was the last}} song to be recorded for Control, and was ultimately chosen as the lead single for the album, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> representative of the sparseness and the funkiness {{that the rest of}} the album had and the attitude Janet had about being in control, being mature to the point where she had definite opinions about what she wanted to say". The song was inspired by one of her experiences in Minneapolis when a group of men made sexual advances towards her outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense." ...|$|E

500|$|The Browns {{reached the}} NFL {{championship}} game in 1951 and 1952, but lost both times. Speedie led the NFL in receiving in 1951 {{and was named}} a first-team All Pro, {{but he did not}} play in the championship game due to an injury. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for a second time in 1952. After that season, however, he left the Browns to join the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union under acrimonious circumstances. Speedie had an independent streak that did not sit well with Brown, whose domineering coaching style grated against many of the men who played for him. [...] "He was one of the ones that Paul Brown picked on quite a bit", recalled former teammate Ken Carpenter. [...] "He'd get on Speedie's case for no particular reason." [...] Speedie showed his displeasure by bringing a skunk to training camp in 1952 and calling it [...] "Paul". Brown told Speedie he did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> funny, to which Speedie responded that it was a nocturnal animal and was named after Paul Revere.|$|E
2500|$|Page said in 2004, [...] "we wanted, after In Through the Out Door, to make {{something}} hard-hitting and riff-based again. Of course, we never got to make that album." [...] He is also quoted as saying [...] "It wasn't the most comfortable album. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> transitional... a springboard for what could have been.|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E
6000|$|... "Envy!" [...] said Lucy, not passionately, {{but after}} a little pause for thought. [...] "I {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{hard to know what}} envy is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hem!' said Mrs Nickleby. 'I don't {{know about}} that, my dear, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{necessary}} that somebody {{should be in}} his confidence; highly necessary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I do <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> selfish in him,' said Alda, 'when {{every one}} of us wants change! I'm as languid as possible; and look at Cherry.' ...|$|R
2500|$|During the [...] "Executive Actions" [...] {{symposium}} held by The Washington Post and George Washington University in April 2015 (shortly {{after the}} launch of the HBO Now streaming service), HBO CEO Richard Plepler said that he does not want the network to be akin to Netflix in which users [...] "binge watch" [...] its television shows and film content, saying [...] "I don't {{think it would have been}} a great thing for HBO or our brand if that had been gobbled up in the first week I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> exciting for the viewer to have that mystery held out for an extended period of time." [...] Pleper cited that he feels that binge watching does not correlate with the culture of HBO and HBO watchers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pushing," [...] he remarked. [...] "There were forty-one wreaths. Yours was beautiful. Philip and I admired it very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] Jeanne admitted. [...] "I went {{to sleep}} {{listening}} for footsteps. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> rude of Ronald to go away without saying good-bye to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> egotistical?" [...] she asked, {{in the gay}} tone {{which gave}} him relief from the sense of oppressive {{elevation}} of mind in her.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is immensely tickled," [...] he said. [...] "She says we {{will make}} her fortune. I don't want to be fatuous, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> interesting,' said Blanche. 'How {{wonderful}} <b>it</b> {{must all}} <b>be</b> to her! I {{will go up}} with you, Mark, as soon as I can get ready.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I would or not. That's neither here nor there. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{nice of you}} to shift the whole {{responsibility}} on me." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> friendly, you know, {{but after}} all no statesman {{can afford to pay}} {{attention}} to his private feelings. His duty is to find the round peg for the round hole and put him in.|$|E
25|$|According to The Gallup Organization's poll, 73% of Armenians in 2006 and 75% in 2007 {{said that}} they <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} for children {{in the country to}} learn Russian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> hard upon Delhi, father, after keeping ahead {{all the way}} {{and going}} so nicely. I think {{everyone}} ought to do their best from the first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course! but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> improper, that habit, {{which every}} one has, of calling {{a man of}} such {{eminence}} {{as the author of}} 'Lalla Rookh' Tom Moore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad we met you, Larry," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "Flo thanked you the night {{you came to}} Cedar, and I wanted to, but, while you know why I couldn't, I would not like you to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unkind of me. Whatever my father does is right, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impertinent of him," [...] Mary {{said in a}} tone of vexation. [...] "I am sure {{nothing could}} have been nicer than they were even when I saw them, I am certain there were no blunders in them, and I don't see how they could be improved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> kind of her {{thinking}} of it," [...] Isobel said, [...] "and I don't {{think it is}} nice of you, Doctor, {{to say that it}} was an evident relief to her when she found I had someone else to take care of me. Why should it have been a relief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} my wedding {{presents}} {{do not meet}} with your approval," [...] I remarked. [...] "Personally I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> kind of my friends to send me anything at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|And thus we {{have seen}} what kind of ideas we have of SUBSTANCES OF ALL KINDS, wherein they consist, and how we came by them. From whence, I <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> evident, ...|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> a good idea. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} to integrate {{various aspects of}} the NOS. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not time consuming, I will try to teach it on different occasions (Yael).|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit, child," [...] {{he assured}} her; [...] "in fact I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> good of you. Now I'll {{put you in}} this {{carriage}} and send you home. Think of nothing except that Sidney is getting better every hour, and sing to-night as though your voice could reach his bedside. Au revoir!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not rude at all; {{and please}} {{you are to}} call me Myra and not mademoiselle. Now, you must get strong {{as soon as you}} can.

6000|$|... "If {{they ask}} me, I shall tell, of course; if they don't ask, I think there 's {{no harm in}} keeping still. I {{should n't have done}} it, if I had n't known my mother was willing; but I don't wish to trouble your mother by telling of it. Do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> dreadful of me?" [...] asked Polly, looking at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> dull here, {{and much}} pleasanter {{in the fields}} to do as one likes. May I come and play with you, and learn to be like you, dear Betty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> good up there," [...] was {{the quick}} reply. [...] "And, anyway, if I were you gentlemen I {{would not go}} {{anywhere}} near the old house up there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't take to Germany," [...] Norgate confessed, [...] "and Germany didn't take to me. Between ourselves--I shouldn't {{like another}} soul {{in the club}} to know it--I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> {{doubtful}} if I go back there." ...|$|R
