40|$|Many {{numerical}} {{studies of}} flows that involve complex geometries {{are limited by}} the difficulties in generating suitable grids. We present a Cartesian boundary scheme for two-dimensional, compressible flows that is unfettered {{by the need to}} generate a computational grid and so it may be used, routinely, even for the most awkward of geometries. In essence, an arbitrary-shaped body is allowed <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> some region of a background Cartesian mesh and the resultant cut-cells are singled out for special treatment. This is done within a finite-volume framework and so, in principle, any explicit flux-based integration scheme can take advantage of this method for enforcing solid boundary conditions. For best effect, the present Cartesian boundary scheme has been combined with a sophisticated, local mesh refinement scheme, and a number of examples are shown in order to demonstrate the efficacy of the combined algorithm for simulations of shock interaction phenomena...|$|E
40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of halo formation and its possible control is highly desirable for essentially all particle accelerators. Particles outside the beam core are not only lost for further experiments, they {{are also likely to}} hit the drift chamber and thereby activate the beam pipe, which makes work on the accelerator costly and time consuming. A well-established technique for transverse beam profile measurements is the observation of synchrotron radiation, optical transition radiation or the like. A particular challenge, however, is the detection of particles in the tail regions of the beam distribution in close proximity of the very intense beam core. Results from laboratory measurements on two different devices are presented that might form the technical base of a future beam halo monitor: the novel SpectraCam XDR camera system which has an intrinsically high dynamic range due to its unique pixel design, and a flexible masking technique based on a DMD micro mirror array which allows for a fast mask generation <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the central core...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing of {{composite}} structures {{with a high}} degree of dimensional accuracy remains a challenge in modern fabrication. Residual stresses in fibre reinforced laminates which develop during the autoclav processing lead to a variety of process induced deformations. Dimensional changes such as spring-in of angled structures and warpage of flat sections are characteristic for composite manufacturing. This paper presents an engineering approch for a thermo-elastic simulation of the spring-in effect on large airframe structures based on the FE method performed at the DLR Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems. Due to the use of Ni 36 as tooling material it was possible <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the influence of varying CTE between tool and part which are responsible for warpage. Investigations on small manufactured L-profiles with a flangelength of 50 mm deliver the necessary simulation parameters for the constitutive model of the relevant airframe structure. For estimating the influence of different autoclav processes on the amount of spring-in, investigations with different temperature profiles were conducted and will be presented...|$|E

40|$|At {{the level}} of {{manifest}} categorical variables, {{a large number of}} coefficients and models for the examination of rater agreement has been proposed and used for descriptive and explanatory purposes. This article focuses on exploring rater agreement. Configural Frequency Analysis (CFA) is proposed as a method of exploration of cross-classifications of raters’ judgements. CFA allows researchers to (1) examine individual cells and sets of cells in agreement tables; (2) examine cells that indicate disagreement; and (3) explore agreement and disagreement among three or more raters. Four CFA base models are discussed. The first is the model of rater agreement that is also used for Cohen’s (1960)  (kappa). This model proposes independence of raters’ judgements. Deviations from this model suggest agreement or disagreement beyond chance. The second CFA model is based on a log-linear null model. This model is also used for Brennan and Prediger’s (1981) n. It proposes a uniform distribution of ratings. The third model is that of Tanner and Young (1985). This model proposes equal weights for agreement cases and independence otherwise. The fourth model is the quasi-independence model. This model allows one <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> agreement cells and thus to focus solely on patterns of disagreement.

40|$|Um museu vivo de memórias pequenas e esquecidas - sobre a ditadura, a revolução e o processo revolucionário [The Living Museum of Small, Forgotten and Unwanted Memories - on dictatorship, revolution, and {{the revolutionary}} process], by Portuguese theatre artist, Joana Craveiro / Teatro do Vestido is a five hour {{performance}} {{that deals with}} Portuguese history from the last century, focusing on the fascist dictatorship (1926 - 1974) and on the 1974 Carnation Revolution. It is a performance composed by five lectures (presented separately throughout 2014 – in its final version it premiered in November 2014). It departs from a minuciously built historical research, mixing innocent family memorabilia such as letters, books and pictures with the most relevant public events that occurred in that period. Craveiro’s work departs usually from autobiographic, personal and subjective materials. This performance is no exception. But this lecture-performance has the singularity of merging the intimate and the public, the factual and the objective, the poetic and the journalistic. 	It is a performance that clearly fights the oblivion of {{the horrors of the}} dictatorship and the current Right Wing politics desire <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> some of its major accomplices and perpetrators. 	Joana Craveiro was born in 1974. I was born in 1975. Politically and ideologically, although there are some nuances on our approaches, I think we are {{on the same side of}} the barricade. And the stories that Joana Craveiro lectures on (memories from the early years of democracy, the freedom of the eighties, contemporary labour precariousness…) are very familiar to me - to a sense that they could be my own memories. Craveiro has created a Museum of Memories for our generation. For me as critic, I have no objective distance whatsoever of this artistic object. I have no option than being Baudelarian (partial, political and passionate) about this performance. As a critic I feel a passionate urge to defend, to read, to discuss this performance as part of my generation task against oblivion. 	The extremeness of this example only signals what I consider to be an inextricably part of criticism: there is nothing objective in performing arts criticism. Criticism always carries the political, generational and subjectively personal signature of its author. The body of the critic is always determinant. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Data {{compression}} and processing of image sequences {{are becoming increasingly}} important {{in the era of}} the information superhighway. This project aims at the development and proof-of-principle of new methods for motion extraction, image sequence compression, and motion analysis. These methods will increase the efficiency of recognition systems and various database applications. The early research into such novel concepts at the forefront of computer vision will benefit LLNL and DOE in all areas associated with archived images and image sequence data. Automated security and surveillance applications are also of special interest in this context. In FY 1997, we started developing a parallel implementation of the face recognition paradigm on the message passing interface (MPI). A parallel implementation is essential to understanding the structure of large image-databases. Our algorithms are now available to interested parties for applications such as scientific data management (SDM). We also are implementing our new algorithms as a growing library of C++ objects. During FY 1997, we focused our research efforts on designing and delivering hardware. In particular, we (1) established the capability to design new retinas and other very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) hardware at LLNL's Institute for Scientific Computing Research (ISCR) and (2) fabricated prototypes through MOSIS, a University of Southern California center for experimental VLSI design. Leveraging our connections to the analog VLSI research community [...] particularly connections with the California Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, and the University of California, San Diego [...] we collaborated with Southern Illinois University (SIU) to develop a novel silicon retina with mixed signal processing capabilities. The ITTRACS device delivers the equivalent of 50 x 10 9 operations (50 GOPS) per second. It performs light detection with logarithmic sensitivity, edge extraction, frame differencing, and centroid calculation at very low power (~ 100 mW). Our chip exploits properties of the silicon substrate, such as the subthreshold behavior of transistors for computational purposes. At the same time, it avoids high power consumption by clocking capacitance at high frequencies. Our new chip offers advanced features such as the capability <b>to</b> <b>blank</b> <b>out</b> the signal calculation [...] e. g., while the platform carrying the sensor updates its position [...] and to track several regions independently. We are preparing a record of invention for this chip. This last fiscal year, we also demonstrated a pilot system that tracks a moving object appearing in its field of view. This two-chip system uses a predecessor of our new retina design to detect the position of the moving object. Due to our expertise in silicon retina applications, we obtained prototypes of a new silicon retina and a link decoder from ourCaltech collaborators. These implementations feature a new integrated bus system called "Address Events," which makes feasible the asynchronous communication of similar chips in a multiprocessor system of similar devices. These prototypes are available for testing...|$|E
