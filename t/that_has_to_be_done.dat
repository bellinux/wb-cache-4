2500|$|As Dewey notes, other {{professional}} fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit {{in their fields}} to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. [...] Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "An intellectual responsibility {{has got to be}} distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility—it is to diffuse irresponsibility" [...] (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.39). [...] For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. [...] Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.|$|E

6000|$|Now I for one am {{prepared}} to take these difficulties very seriously, as {{the latter part of}} this book will show.

Here they built themselves huts of logs, and here they tried to keep themselves warm and to be satisfied with what they had; for the government was poor, and found it hard to keep an army. There was plenty to eat and drink in the surrounding country, but there was very little money with which to buy it.|$|E

6000|$|This is but {{a slight}} {{specimen}} of the providing, dovetailing, timing, and guarding <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on all the lines in the kingdom. In the same sheet from which the above is quoted, we find notes, cautions, and intimations as to such various matters as the holding of the levers of facing points when trains are passing through junctions; the attention required of drivers to new signals; the improper use of telegraph bells; the making search for lost [...] "passes;" [...] the more careful loading of goods waggons; the changes in regard to particular trains; the necessity of watchfulness {{on the part of}} station-masters, robberies having been committed on the line; the intimation of dates when and places where ballast trains are to be working on the line; the times and, places when and where repairs to line are to take place during the brief intervals between trains of the ordinary traffic; and many other matters, which naturally lead one to the belief that superintendents of railways must possess the eyes of Argus, the generalship of Wellington, and the patience of Job.|$|E
6000|$|The duty of {{arranging}} {{the details of}} the system devolves on the superintendents of departments on the line, namely, the passenger, goods, and locomotive superintendents, each of whom reigns independently and supreme in his own department, but of course, like the members of a well-ordered family, they have to consult together in order that their trains may be properly horsed, and the time of running so arranged that there shall be no clashing in their distinct though united interests. When the number of trains and time of running have been fixed, and finally published by the passenger superintendent--who is also sometimes the [...] "Out-door superintendent," [...] and who has duties to perform that demand very considerable powers of generalship,--it is the duty of the locomotive superintendent to supply the requisite engines. This officer, besides caring for all the [...] "plant" [...] or rolling-stock, new and old, draws out periodically a schedule, in which is detailed to a nicety every minute act <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by drivers--the hour at which each engine is to leave the shed on each day of the week, the number of each engine, its driver and fireman, and the duties to be performed; and this sheet contains complete daily (nay, almost hourly) directions for passenger, goods, and pilot-engines.|$|E

Mr. O'Laugher, who, as the phrase goes, is with Mr. O'Malley, begins by declaring that the list from which the names are read is an illegal list--a foolish, useless, unauthoritative list--nothing but balderdash, moonshine, and waste paper--all empty sounds, and consisting of a string of names as little to the purpose in the present case as a regimental roll-call. The sub-sheriff, who with infinite clerkly care, and much sub-shrieval experience, has made out the list, opens wide his disturbed ears, and begins to feel somewhat uncomfortable. Mr. O'Laugher goes on to declare that the present list, instead of being one properly, legally, and expressly drawn out for March 183--, is only a copy of the one in use during the summer assizes in the last year, and assures the judge with much indignant emphasis, that he cannot allow his client to submit to the injustice of receiving a verdict from a jury composed under such atrocious circumstances.|$|E

60|$|Man has, in all ages, been tempted, when {{he looks}} at his own wickedness and folly, not only to despise himself--which he has good reason enough to do--but to despise his own human nature, and to cry to God, 'Why hast thou made me thus?' He has cursed his own human nature. He has said, 'Surely man is most miserable of all the beasts of the field.' He has said, 'I must get rid of my human nature--I must give up wife, family, human life of all kinds, I must go into the deserts and the forests, and there try to forget that I am a man, and become a mere spirit or angel.' So said the Buddhists of Asia, the deepest thinkers {{concerning}} man and God of all the heathens, and so have many said since their time. But so does the Bible not say. It starts by telling us that man is made in God's likeness, and that therefore his human nature is originally and in itself not a bad, but a perfectly good thing. All <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to it is to be cured of its diseases; and the Bible declares that it can be cured. Howsoever man may have fallen, he may rise. Howsoever the likeness may be blotted and corrupted, it can be cleansed and renewed. Howsoever it may be perverted and turned right round and away from God and goodness to selfishness and evil, it can be converted, and turned back again to God. Howsoever utterly far gone man may be from original righteousness, still to original righteousness he can return, by the grace of baptism and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. And what in us is the likeness of God? That is a deep question.|$|E
60|$|But {{these are}} the mere opening {{requirements}} of this hope of mine of a quickened social consciousness among the more fortunate and leisurely section of the community I believe that much profounder changes in the conditions of labour are possible than those I have suggested I am beginning to suspect that scarcely any of our preconceptions about the way work must be done, about the hours of work and the habits of work, will stand an exhaustive scientific analysis. It is at least conceivable {{that we could get}} much of the work <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to keep our community going in far more toil-saving and life-saving ways than we follow at the present time. So far scientific men have done scarcely anything to estimate under what conditions a man works best, does most work, works more happily. Suppose {{it turns out to be}} the case that a man always following one occupation throughout his lifetime, working regularly day after day for so many hours, as most wage-earners do at the present time, does not do nearly so much or nearly so well as he would do if he followed first one occupation and then another, or if he worked as hard as he possibly could for a definite period and then took holiday? I suspect very strongly, indeed I am convinced, that in certain occupations, teaching, for example, or surgery, a man begins by working clumsily and awkwardly, that his interest and skill rise rapidly, that if he is really well suited in his profession he may presently become intensely interested and capable of enormous quantities of his very best work, and that then his interest and vigour rapidly decline I am disposed to believe that this is true of most occupations, of coal-mining or engineering, or brick-laying or cotton-spinning. The thing has never been properly thought about. Our civilisation has grown up in a haphazard kind of way, and it has been convenient to specialise workers and employ them piecemeal. But if it is true that in respect of any occupation a man has his period of maximum efficiency, then we open up a whole world of new social possibilities. What we really want from a man for our social welfare in that case is not regular continuing work, but a few strenuous years of high-pressure service. We can as a community afford to keep him longer at education and training before he begins, and we can release him with a pension while he is still full of life and the capacity for enjoying freedom. But obviously this is impossible upon any basis of weekly wages and intermittent employment; we must be handling affairs in some much more comprehensive way than that before we can take and deal with the working life of a man as one complete whole.|$|E
