30|$|In this paper, {{aiming at}} the problem of UAV path {{planning}} for multiple moving <b>targets,</b> after <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are determined, radar is used to observe <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> and obtain their observation positions.

40|$|In angle-only <b>target</b> {{tracking}} <b>the</b> aim is {{to estimate}} the state of a target with use of measurement of elevation and azimuth. The state consists of relative position and velocity between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> platform. The platform is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and the tracking system {{is meant to be}} a part of the platform’s anti-collision system. In the case where both <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> platform travel with constant velocity the angle measurements do not provide any information of the range between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> platform. The platform has to maneuver to be able to estimate the range to <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> Two filters are implemented and tested on simulated data. The first filter is based on a Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is designed for tracking nonmaneuvering targets. Different platform maneuvers are studied and the influence of initial errors and the geometry of the simulation scenario is investigated. The filter is able to estimate the position of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> if <b>the</b> platform maneuvers and <b>the</b> <b>target</b> travels with constant velocity. Maneuvering <b>targets</b> on <b>the</b> other hand can not be tracked by the filter. The second filter is an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter, designed for tracking maneuvering <b>targets.</b> <b>The</b> filter performance is highly dependent of the geometry of the scenario. The filter has been tuned for a scenario where <b>the</b> <b>target</b> approaches <b>the</b> platform from the front. In this scenario the filter is able to track both maneuvering and non-maneuvering <b>targets.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>target</b> approaches <b>the</b> platform from the side on the other hand, the filter has problems with distinguish target maneuvers from measurement noise...|$|R
