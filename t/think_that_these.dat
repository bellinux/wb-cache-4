5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} of the Nuragic holy wells follows the same pattern {{as that of the}} nuraghe, the main part consisting of a circular room with a tholos vault with a hole at the summit. A monumental staircase connected the entrance to this subterranean (hypogeum) room, whose main role is to collect the water of the sacred spring. The exterior walls feature stone benches where offerings and religious objects were placed by the faithful. Some sites also had sacrificial altars.

25|$|In its broader context, the Judgment of Solomon forms part of {{the account}} of Solomon's reign, {{generally}} conceived as a distinct segment in the Book of Kings, compassing chapters 3–11 in 1 Kings; Some include in it also chapters 1–2, while others <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> chapters originally ended the account of David's reign in 2 Samuel. According to Liver, the source for the Judgment of Solomon story, {{as well as other}} parts of the account of Solomon's reign, is in the speculated book of the Acts of Solomon, which he proposes to be a wisdom work which originated in the court circles shortly after the split of the united monarchy.|$|E

Ellison continued involvement with rugby as a provincial administrator, provincial referee, and manager. As an administrator, he proposed that players be financially compensated for wages missed while on long tours; this was in 1898—nearly a century before rugby relinquished its amateur status. This proposal applied specifically to tours that travelled outside New Zealand; writing at the time regarding the amateur regulations, Ellison said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> laws were never intended to apply to extended tours abroad." [...] In 1902 he published The Art of Rugby Football, a coaching manual on rugby that also included accounts of his experiences as a player. According to journalist Hayden Meikle the book was one of rugby's [...] "pioneering texts", while Greg Ryan wrote that the book [...] "remains a classic work on early rugby strategy." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson was a devout, {{conservative}} Anglican and {{a compassionate}} man who supported {{a number of}} poor friends under his own roof, even when unable to fully provide for himself. Johnson's Christian morality permeated his works, and he would write on moral topics with such authority and in such a trusting manner that, Walter Jackson Bate claims, [...] "no other moralist in history excels or even begins to rival him". However, Johnson's moral writings do not contain, as Donald Greene points out, [...] "a predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior, even though Johnson does emphasise certain kinds of conduct. He did not let his own faith prejudice him against others, and had respect for those of other denominations who demonstrated a commitment to Christ's teachings. Although Johnson respected John Milton's poetry, he could not tolerate Milton's Puritan and Republican beliefs, feeling that they were contrary to England and Christianity. He was an opponent of slavery on moral grounds, and once proposed a toast to the [...] "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies". Beside his beliefs concerning humanity, Johnson is also known for his love of cats, especially his own two cats, Hodge and Lily. Boswell wrote, [...] "I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself {{used to go out}} and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature." [...] It is a common error to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> oysters were expensive, since they are so in modern Britain. However, in Johnson's time they were very cheap and eaten by the poor. [...] He thought that his servant, Frank, might resent Hodge if he had to go buy the oysters for him.|$|E

2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E
