50|$|Not much pure {{magnesium}} is extruded, for it has somewhat poor properties, {{especially as}} regards its proof stress. The alloying elements of chief concern at present are aluminium, zinc, cerium and zirconium; manganese is usually also present since, {{though it has}} {{little effect on the}} strength, it has a valuable function in improving corrosion resistance. One important binary alloy, containing up to 2.0% manganese, is used extensively for the manufacture of rolled sheet. It is comparatively soft and easier to extrude than other alloys, and {{is also one of the}} few that can be rolled directly without pre-extrusion.In the UK, extrusions are made from billets of 2.87 - 12 in dia. On presses varying in power over the range 600-3500 tons; normal maximum pressures on the billet are 30-50 tons/sq. in the U.S the Dow chemical company have recently installed a 13.200 ton press capable of handling billets up to 32 in. Extrusion technique is generally similar to that for aluminium base alloys but, according to Wilkinson and fox, die design requires special consideration and, in their opinion, should incorporate short bearing lengths and sharp die entries. <b>Tube</b> <b>extrusion</b> in alloys AM503, ZW2, and ZW3 is now made with bridge dies.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of the charts of 106 Mexican children implanted with 128 AGVs operated between 1994 and 2002, with the needle track technique, at our institution, with {{at least six months}} follow up was done. Main outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP) control, <b>tube</b> <b>extrusions</b> or exposure and other complications. Results: Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a 96. 9 &#x 0025; survival rate at six months, 82. 4 &#x 0025; at one year, 78. 7 &#x 0025; at two years, 70 &#x 0025; at three years and 41. 6 &#x 0025; at four years.

The mean pre- and post-operative IOP at the last follow up was 28. 4 mmHg (SD 9. 3) and 14. 5 mmHg (SD 6. 3), respectively. No <b>tube</b> <b>extrusions</b> or exposures were observed. Tube-related complications included five retractions, a lens touch and a transitory endothelial touch. The risk of failure increased if the eye had any complication or previous glaucoma surgeries.

Superalloy IN 718 large tube {{is used in}} {{critical}} jet engine applications, while manufacturing such components, the control of temperature during <b>tube</b> hot <b>extrusion</b> is of paramount importance.

The constitutive behaviour of the material and friction at the extrusion temperatures are established as a thermoplastic process. In order to investigate the influence of technological parameters of extrusion process on the temperatures rise and extrusion force, then the extrusion variables such as friction factor, ram speed, tool and billet preheating temperature are taking into consideration. Besides tool preheating temperature, other parameters have a great influence on temperature rise of billet during the extrusion process. All of technological parameter of study in this paper have a significant influence on the extrusion force. Moreover, based on the simulation results, the case with tool preheating temperature of 300 °C should avoid during the technology making. ...|$|R

A {{two-dimensional}} axi-symmetric {{finite element}} model for the <b>tube</b> hot <b>extrusion</b> process was developed based on Deform- 2 D software by consideration of the billet transfer, glass lubrication and the constitutive characteristics of IN 690 superalloy. An enhanced technique for adaptive mesh refinement (AR) is used to solve the large deformation problem. This model was then used to study the effect of boundary conditions and process parameters in <b>tube</b> hot <b>extrusion.</b> The Non-uniform deformation index as the representative parameter, which denotes the non-uniform deformation during the steady state of <b>tube</b> hot <b>extrusion,</b> is presented accordance to the feature of metal flow at deformation zone. The bigger of Non-uniform deformation index, the worse of non-uniform strain distribution. When the non-uniform deformation index getting smaller, the equivalent strain distribution along the length and cross section become more uniform and better product quality could be obtained. An increase in the billet and die preheating temperature could reduce the non-uniform deformation index individually. But the billet and die preheating temperature should not be too high. The increase of friction coefficient, the non-uniform deformation index also increased, which indicate appreciable results of metal flow. With the ram speed increase, the non-uniform deformation index decreases, but too fast speed is inadmissibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} <b>tube</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{process has}} been substituted by porthole die extrusion due to relevant advantages in terms of productivity and quality. However, the porthole die has a complex geometry to be effectively designed; consequently, several studies can be found out in the technical literature based on experimental and finite element analyses of the process. From this point of view, while the experimental investigations entail cost and time increasing, due to the die building complexity, finite element techniques present some drawbacks such as the difficulty to simulate material joining {{and the loss of}} accuracy due to the heavy mesh distortion and related remeshing. Therefore, the introduction of new numerical techniques for the analyses of this process could have positive effects. In this paper, the Natural Element Method (NEM) together to the alpha shapes and some extra numerical procedures are used in the simulation of <b>tube</b> <b>extrusion,</b> focusing the attention on the simulation of the welding line in a fully 3 D analysis.

The tumescence was {{induced by the}} displacement of internal calcium. Sodium citrate, phosphate, and the calcium ionophore A 23187 were effective in initiating polaroplast swelling and spore discharge; however, the addition of external CaCl 2 switched the expanded polaroplasts to a contracted state and blocked spore discharge. Unlike CaCl 2, equivalent concentrations of KCl, NaCl, MgCl 2, and BaCl 2 did not induced polaroplast contraction, and spore discharge was not blocked. 45 CaCl 2 readily incorporated into spores with expanded polaroplasts; however, little calcium uptake was apparent in spores with contracted polaroplasts. Metallochromic arsenazo III yielded a color spectrum characteristic of the dye-Ca++ complex in the polaroplast region; furthermore, a membrane association with calcium was indicated by strong chlorotetracycline fluorescence within the polaroplast; this fluorescence was extinguished by pretreating spores with ionophore A 23187.

Demographic and epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, simultaneous injuries and complications of patients who underwent canalicular laceration repair surgery were analyzed. Results: A total of 556 patients were identified with an eyelid laceration, and in 42 (7. 55 %) of these patients 44 lacrimal canalicular lacerations were detected. The average age was 26. 16 ± 18. 42 (range 5 to 78) years and mean follow-up time was 17. 62 ± 6. 62 months (range 12 - 42 months). The male-to-female ratio was 5. 3 - 1. The lower canaliculus was involved in 33 patients (78. 57 %), the upper in 7 patients (16. 6 %), and 2 patients (4. 76 %) had bicanalicular involvement. The most common etiology of canalicular laceration was assault (n = 16, 38. 1 %) followed by traffic accidents (n = 8, 19. 05 %). In 28 patients (66. 67 %) surgery was performed within 24 hours and in 14 patients (33. 33 %) surgery was performed between 24 hours and 6 days.

METHODS: Prospective cohort study on 136 children aged 2 - 7 years, who received tympanostomy tubes for bilateral otitis media with effusion.

An otologist examined the ear status to assess <b>tube</b> <b>extrusion</b> and otitis media with effusion recurrence. Outcome measure was the recurrence of otitis media with effusion within 6 months after documentation of spontaneous <b>tube</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Birth characteristics were investigated in relation with the recurrence of otitis media with effusion in 90 children with known clinical outcome. RESULTS: No statistically significant associations were found between various birth characteristics and the recurrence of otitis media with effusion. Multivariate analyses showed positive but fairly weak associations between recurrence of otitis media with effusion and low birth weight (< 2500 g) and/or low gestational age (< 37 weeks) and/or a history of incubator care (odds ratio (OR) 1. 95, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 21 - 18. 2), male sex (OR 1. 85, 95 % CI: 0. 56 - 6. 13) and maternal medication use during pregnancy (OR 4. 80, 95 % CI: 0. 57 - 40. 72). A remarkable finding was the asymmetrical distribution of certain birth characteristics within the group of children with recurrence of otitis media with effusion: children with unilateral recurrence had a relatively lower gestational age, lower birth weight, lower 'birth length to birth weight' ratio than the children with bilateral recurrence.
