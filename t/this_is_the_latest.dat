5|$|With a {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted {{for several days}} prior {{to the arrival of}} the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> date for the first hurricane since 1967. Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high pressures {{to the north of the}} hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Hurricane Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour, and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

25|$|King Wulfhere's charter, and Bede's {{mention of}} Medeshamstede's foundation, place {{this in the}} period of the Christianisation of Mercia. Documents {{preserved}} at Peterborough Abbey indicate that Medeshamstede {{played a central role in}} spreading and consolidating Christianity in Mercia and elsewhere, for example through the pastoral care provided by a string of daughter churches. Apart from churches connected with the local saints mentioned above, these are held to have included, among other candidates, churches at Breedon in Leicestershire, and Bermondsey and Woking, in Surrey. Medeshamstede has also been identified as the mother church of Repton, in Derbyshire, which has been described as an 8th-century Mercian royal mausoleum. Another charter preserved at Peterborough was written at Repton in 848 AD, and concerned Breedon. This suggests that this monastic empire continued for some considerable time. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> surviving reference to any connection between Medeshamstede and its daughter churches, and these connections probably suffered a similar fate to many of the episcopal sees of eastern England: extinguished in the later 9th century by Viking invasion.|$|E
2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> {{technology}} of voltage regulation to provide real-time control of voltage fluctuation, sag, surge {{and also to}} control other power quality issues such as spikes and EMI/RFI electrical noises. [...] This uses an IGBT regulator engine generating pulse width modulated (PWM) AC voltage at high switching frequency. [...] This AC PWM wave is superimposed on the main incoming wave through a buck-boost transformer, to provide precisely regulated AC voltage. The regulation in this technology is instantaneous, thus making it suitable for electronic machines which need precise regulated power.|$|E

This eruption, which likely reached 5on the , {{was similar to the}} 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. It sent a massive Plinian column at least [...] high into the atmosphere. Prevailing westerly winds carried volcanic ash from this explosion eastwards to as far as Alberta. Nearby areas were devastated by heavy pyroclastic fall when parts of the Plinian column collapsed. Later, a series of pyroclastic flows were erupted and travelled [...] from their source. After this, a lava flow was erupted that repeatedly collapsed on Meager's steep flanks, creating a thick, welded breccia deposit that blocked the Lillooet River. This created a lake just upstream which later collapsed to produce a massive [...] Large boulders were carried downstream for more than , but the destructive floodwaters continued further. Later, a small dacite lava flow was erupted, which cooled into well-preserved columnar joints.
