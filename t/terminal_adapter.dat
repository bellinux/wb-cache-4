5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of low-cost high-speed modems in the early 1990s, Gandalf increasingly became irrelevant. Even their highest-speed solutions were soon being outperformed by standardized systems like v.32bis. Low-cost <b>terminal</b> <b>adapters</b> based on RADIUS (and similar) technologies connecting to Ethernet further eroded their core businesses, offering features similar to their PACX switches. Gandalf's solutions were decidedly [...] "low tech"; users selected what computer they wanted to connect to by selecting a two-digit number {{on the front of}} the modem, often requiring a [...] "phone book" [...] if more than one host computer was being used. In comparison, the more modern <b>terminal</b> <b>adapters</b> generally included a command line interface that allowed the user to select a host from a directory that appeared on their terminal. Introductions of Ethernet concentrators and ISDN-based versions of their earlier host adapters did little to fix the problem, never becoming very popular in comparison to the standardized solutions from other vendors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{subscriber}} line {{interface circuit}} (SLIC) provides DC power, ringing and supervision functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone {{is a prerequisite}} but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs have also been used in <b>Terminal</b> <b>Adapters</b> (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Network Termination (NT) applications. This application note provides a detailed design procedure for the flyback transformer {{that can be used}} with MAX 1856 in SLIC power supplies. The MAX 1856 offers a low cost solution for generating subscriber line interface circuits (SLIC) power supplies. The SLIC provides DC power, ringing and supervision functions for the "plain old telephone service " (POTS) where alerting a telephone is a prerequisite but a central ringer is generally not available. SLICs which incorporate the ringer function, have been used in <b>Terminal</b> <b>Adapters</b> (TA), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and Network Termination (NT) applications. This document presents a sampling of power supply reference designs for use with typical SLICs in two- channel and four-channel POTS loops. Each application has specialized requirements depending on the number of channels serviced and loop length. The requirements for three typical applications are presented in Table 1...|$|R
5000|$|Apart from audio products, Aiwa {{also has}} been present in other industries.

50|$|In the {{automation}} industry, a <b>terminal</b> <b>adapter</b> is {{a passive}} device that converts a connector like the 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connector or 9 pin D-Sub into a terminal block to facilitate wiring. It {{is often used}} when daisy-chain wiring is necessary on a multi-node serial communication network like RS-485 or RS-422.|$|E
50|$|A network {{termination}} (NT) (also NTE for {{network termination}} equipment) is {{a device that}} connects the customer's data or telephone equipment to a carrier's line that comes into a building or an office. The NT device provides a connection for terminal equipment (TE) and <b>terminal</b> <b>adapter</b> (TA) equipment to the local loop.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, ISDN {{was very}} popular with an {{installed}} base of 25 million channels (29% of all subscriber lines in Germany as of 2003 and 20% of all ISDN channels worldwide). Due {{to the success of}} ISDN, the number of installed analog lines was decreasing. Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) offered both BRI and PRI. Competing phone companies often offered ISDN only and no analog lines. However, these operators generally offered free hardware that also allows the use of POTS equipment, such as NTBAs with integrated <b>terminal</b> <b>adapters.</b> Because of the widespread availability of ADSL services, ISDN was primarily used for voice and fax traffic.|$|R
50|$|Communications - Synchronous Communications Adapter (SCA). The IBM 1130 MTCA, for Multiple <b>Terminal</b> Control <b>Adapter,</b> {{announced}} in 1970 allowed {{up to four}} 2741 terminals {{to be connected to}} an IBM 1130, for use with APL.|$|R
50|$|In {{the diagram}} above, {{there is a}} sample-rate clock in the fax {{terminal}} {{and one in the}} gateway’s modems that is used to trigger the sampling of the analog line 8,000 times per second. These clocks are usually quite accurate, but in some low-cost <b>terminal</b> <b>adapters</b> (a one or two-line gateway) the PCM clock can be surprisingly inaccurate. If the terminal is sending data to the gateway, and the gateway’s clock is too slow, the buffers (jitter buffers) in the gateway will eventually overflow, causing the transaction to fail. Since the difference is often quite small, this problem occurs on long, detailed fax images giving the clocks more time to cause the jitter buffer in the gateway to either underflow or overflow, which is just the same as missing or duplicated packets.|$|R
50|$|These devices {{go under}} several names, such as Digital <b>Terminal</b> <b>Adapter,</b> Digital Transport Adapter, or Digital Adapter. They {{generally}} do not offer pay-per-view or DVR support, but Rovi (formerly Macrovision) is deploying an on-screen guide that would allow subscribers {{to see what is}} on TV at the moment. Digital adapters are intended for rooms with less used TVs or for basic cable subscribers.|$|E
50|$|In some DSL {{variations}} (for example, HDSL), the <b>terminal</b> <b>adapter</b> connects {{directly to}} the computer via a serial interface, using protocols such as ethernet or V.35. In other cases (particularly ADSL), {{it is common for}} the customer equipment to be integrated with higher level functionality, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the equipment is referred to as a gateway.|$|E
50|$|Both {{programs}} use the Session Initiation Protocol for VoIP call signalisation. Calls {{are supported}} via server-based infrastructure or direct IP to IP. Media streams are transmitted via the Real-time Transport Protocol {{which may be}} encrypted with the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and the ZRTP security protocols. Phoner provides as well an interface for configuring and using all supplementary ISDN services provided via CAPI and thus needs an ISDN <b>terminal</b> <b>adapter</b> hardware installed in the computer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the cost structure of broadband wireline access networks {{based on the}} Internet Protocol (IP) offering integrated Internet access and voice services for households and small businesses. The first network follows a telco-based architecture. The architecture for the cable plant is similar to recent designs for Digital Loop Carrier (DLC) systems with fiber to the serving area and copper pairs to the customer premise. However, the PSTN infrastructure is completely replaced by an IP network that is extended to the home using ADSL technology. The second network follows a cable-based architecture. The cable plant follows recent trends {{in the design of}} Hybrid Fiber Coaxial (HFC) networks. The IP network is extended to the home using a cable modem platform that follows the DOCSIS reference model from Cable Labs. The IP architecture, which supports Internet access and voice, is basically the same for both networks. Voice service is based on VoIP with IP soft switches at the central office/headend and Multi <b>Terminal</b> <b>Adapters</b> (MTA) at customer premises. Our model calculates forward looking (TELRIC) capital costs for constructing a broadband access network and provides a systematic way to compare different broadband architectures and technologies.
