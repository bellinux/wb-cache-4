60|$|Yes, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> about eleven {{acres in}} the {{vineyard}}--wine grapes. The price was usually good. He grew most of what they ate. If he owned the place, he'd clear a patch of land on the side-hill above the vineyard and plant a small home orchard. The soil <b>was</b> good. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> plenty of pasturage all over the ranch, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>several</b> cleared patches, <b>amounting</b> to about fifteen acres in all, where he grew as much mountain hay as could be found. It sold for three to five dollars more a ton than the rank-stalked valley hay.|$|R
30|$|Comparing all {{the single}} protein {{adsorption}} results obtained, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>several</b> similarities. The <b>amount</b> of adsorbed proteins indeed increased sharply within the initial stage of incubation {{and then slowly}} proceed {{as a function of}} the time until reaching a plateau region in an hour. All surfaces inhibited protein adsorption compared to references. Electrostatic effects between the protein charge and the zwitterionic PCBMA surface is found to be the most significant factor that plays a major role in guiding protein adsorption. At pH 7, PCBMA surfaces are slightly positive charged, so they effectively inhibit the positively charged Lys but promote negatively charged albumins and Fbn to some extent: within the limits of other surface properties like hydrophilicity and graft density. However, among proteins with high pI, the decreased amount of adsorption of HSA and Fbn shows that the size of the protein can be also a deciding factor of overall protein adsorption behavior. High molecular weight proteins are more effectively shielded from PCBMA surfaces and this size effect is observed to be more effective on surfaces that are more thickly grafted, viz, TEMPO surfaces. Differences in hydrophilic and hydrophobic chain ends were also studied by incorporating corresponding end-groups in relation with their obtained grafting density. These results indicate that rate and amount of protein adsorption on the solid surfaces is highly dependent on the surface properties and the engineered monomers are an easy way to tune surface properties by adjusting various parameters like surface charge, charge density, hydrophility, graft density etc. and provide room for post functionalization.|$|R
