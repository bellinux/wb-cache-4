5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} <b>too</b> <b>that</b> he is an actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men {{only to discover that}} the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this time <b>too</b> <b>that</b> Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1805, Nicolls was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain, and assigned command of a company which embarked in HMS Standard. During 1807 and 1808, Nicolls participated in the siege of Corfu and in a foray to Egypt. It was during this period, <b>too,</b> <b>that</b> he was honourably mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Dardanelles Operation, during which he captured a Turkish flag. In 1808 he led the boat attack from the Standard which captured the Italian gunboat Volpe off Corfu.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in the charge against the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say <b>too</b> <b>that</b> there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
5|$|Alchemy {{was already}} well {{established}} before {{the rise of}} Islam. It {{was based on the}} belief that substances were made up of the four Aristotelian elements, fire, earth, air, and water in different proportions. Alchemists supposed that gold was the noblest metal, and that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, <b>too,</b> <b>that</b> a fifth element, the elixir, could transform a base metal into gold. Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th–9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue to be used when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the retort stand.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, <b>too,</b> <b>that</b> a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{lifetime}} of Bahá'u'lláh, the religion was established in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, then under Russian control. While in Samarkand in 1892 Gulpaygani wrote a book, Fassl-ul-Khitab (Conclusive Proof), {{in response to the}} questions of Mirza Haydar-Ali of Tabriz. It was in Samarkand, <b>too,</b> <b>that</b> he debated a Protestant preacher. In 1910 the Samarkand Bahá'í community elected its first assembly in addition to having a school, and built a center which held four meetings a week.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in this}} period, <b>too,</b> <b>that</b> English {{folk music}} {{traveled}} across the Atlantic Ocean and became the foundation for and main ancestor of American traditional music. In the colonies, it mixed with styles of music brought by other immigrant groups to create {{a host of new}} genres. For instance, English balladry combined with African banjo playing ultimately produced bluegrass and country music, which evolved, when combined with African-American blues, into rock and roll.|$|E
25|$|The {{defenders}} of its Pauline authorship {{argue that it}} was intended to be read by a number of different churches and that it marks the final stage of the development of Paul's thinking. It has been said, <b>too,</b> <b>that</b> the moral portion of the Epistle, consisting of the last two chapters, has the closest affinity with similar portions of other Epistles, while the whole admirably fits in with the known details of Paul's life, and throws considerable light upon them.|$|E

25|$|The Koine Greek terms {{used in the}} New Testament of the {{structure}} on which Jesus died are stauros (σταυρός) and xylon (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of {{the structure}}. Scholars {{have long known that}} the Greek word stauros and the Latin word crux did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known <b>too</b> <b>that</b> the words had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.|$|E
25|$|Until Ocean Grove's {{municipal}} authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. People looking to get away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, <b>too).</b> <b>That</b> meant the visitors were likely to be coming for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressures}} and temptations {{of being a}} high-profile rock musician and requirements of the spiritual lifestyle which guru Sri Chinmoy and his followers demanded were in conflict, and imposed considerable stress upon Santana's lifestyle and marriage. He was becoming increasingly disillusioned with what he thought were the unreasonable rules that Chinmoy imposed on his life, and in particular with his refusal to allow Santana and Deborah to start a family. He felt <b>too</b> <b>that</b> his fame was being used to increase the guru's visibility. Santana and Deborah eventually ended their relationship with Chinmoy in 1982.|$|E
