5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse {{under the influence of}} gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It {{has been the focus of}} debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E

25|$|Because a large {{proportion}} of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are particularly important <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processes by which stars form. In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system. Because this is a conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed.|$|E

25|$|Coronal loops {{are very}} {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current coronal heating problem. Coronal loops are highly radiating sources of plasma and are therefore easy to observe by instruments such as TRACE. An explanation of the coronal heating problem remains as these structures are being observed remotely, where many ambiguities are present (i.e. radiation contributions along the LOS). In-situ measurements are required before a definitive answer can be had, but due to the high plasma temperatures in the corona, in-situ measurements are, at present, impossible. The next mission of the NASA Solar Probe Plus will approach the Sun very closely allowing more direct observations.|$|E
500|$|However, Hawking {{has also}} {{expressed}} dissatisfaction regarding {{the impact on}} his notoriety caused by his appearance in the episode. In a debate with physicist Brian Cox in The Guardian, Hawking was asked what the most common misconception about his work was. He replied, [...] "People think I'm a Simpsons character." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Peter Hutchison argued that Hawking [...] "feels he is sometimes not properly recognised for his contribution <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe."

500|$|Gens {{himself has}} been called [...] "one of the most {{controversial}} Jewish ghetto leaders". Chaim Lazar, a member of the FPO, wrote of Gens that [...] "It may be charged that his course was harmful, but everyone knows that he was never a traitor. All that he did during his tenure as Chief of the Ghetto was for his people". Yitzhak Arad, in his history of the Vilnius Ghetto, says that Gens [...] "erred in his fundamental conception– that the German administration regarded the existence of the ghetto and its inhabitants vital for economic reasons" [...] and that [...] "the policy laid down by Jacob Gens {{was the only one that}} afforded hope and some prospect of survival". Vadim Altskan, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, states that [...] "...Holocaust historiography treated people such as... Jacob Gens... as instruments of destruction in the hands of the Nazi killing machine.... Applied retrospectively, these charges for the most part are judgmental and add very little <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events. Neither Jewish functionaries nor 'ordinary' Jews had any practical or psychological experience in dealing with the grim reality of the Nazi occupation, because never before in their long history of persecution had the Jews experienced an assault of such magnitude and careful design." [...] Regarding the charge of collaborating with the Germans, Dawidowicz opined, [...] "to say that [...] 'cooperated' or 'collaborated' with the Germans is semantic confusion and historical misrepresentation". The Israeli Zionist poet Nathan Alterman investigated the history of the Vilnius Ghetto, including interviewing survivors such as Abba Kovner, and stated [...] "Had I been in the ghetto, I would have been on the side of the Judenrat." ...|$|E
