5|$|Although Tacitus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are {{complicated by the fact that}} his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor. In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his <b>triumph</b> <b>over</b> the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E
