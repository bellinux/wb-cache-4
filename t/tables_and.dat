The codex also contains astrological <b>tables</b> <b>and</b> ritual schedules. The religious references show in a cycle of a 260-day ritual calendar the important Maya royal events. The codex also includes information on the Maya new-year ceremony tradition. The rain god Chaac is represented 134 times.|$|E

By the 2010s most cafes were configured as club-dinettes; some had been converted into all-table dinettes. Five dinettes were rebuilt for use on the Inter-American, a long-distance train operating between Texas and St. Louis, Missouri; lounge seats replaced the coach seats. 21 dinettes were also refurbished for Metroliner service. By the 2010s all the remaining dinettes were rebuilt with all-table seating, save two which were converted into short-distance coaches.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine <b>Tables</b> <b>and</b> the related Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset {{the costs of}} producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld.

By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E
