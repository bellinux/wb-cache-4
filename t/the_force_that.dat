5|$|Horrocks was {{the first}} to {{demonstrate}} that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth. He also wrote a treatise on Keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically the properties of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> became known as gravity; Isaac Newton in the Principia acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to his theory of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In 1075, Walter {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> {{prevented}} Roger de Breteuil from joining up with the other rebels during the Revolt of the Earls.

5|$|Matt Baggott—who when Madeleine {{disappeared}} {{was chief}} constable of Leicestershire Police, <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> coordinated the British {{side of the}} case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese {{were in charge of}} the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force's priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.|$|E
5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E
5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> the Earth feels daily from the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Hansa served {{abroad in}} the East Asia Squadron {{for the first}} six years of her career. Along with Hertha, she contributed a landing party to <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> {{captured}} the Taku Forts during the Boxer Rebellion. In August 1904, she participated in the internment of the Russian battleship Tsesarevich after the Battle of the Yellow Sea during the Russo-Japanese War. After returning to Germany in 1906, she was modernized and used as a training ship in 1909, following the completion of the refit. At the outbreak of World War I, Hansa was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen {{as the work of}} angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Imamura was {{up against}} a resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, who also had access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although {{they did not know}} the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E

5|$|The {{strong force}} only acts {{directly}} upon elementary particles. However, a residual {{of the force}} is observed between hadrons (the best known example being <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for free quarks {{has shown that the}} elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called color confinement.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, they {{experienced}} further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten {{by a small}} garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was.|$|E
5|$|Another sortie {{into the}} North Sea {{followed}} on 19–20 October. On 21 December, Nassau ran aground {{in the mouth}} of the Elbe. She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, Nassau took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E

5|$|As British {{forces on}} the {{southeast}} coast of Britain regrouped, remanned and repaired following heavy losses at Zeebrugge, Keyes planned a return to Ostend {{with the intention of}} blocking the canal and consequently severing Bruges from the sea, closing the harbour and trapping the 18U-boats and 25destroyers present for months to come. Volunteers from among <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> had failed in April aided the planning with advice based on their experience on the previous operation. Among these volunteers were Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy of , Commander Alfred Godsal, former captain of , and Brilliants first lieutenant Victor Crutchley. These officers approached Commodore Hubert Lynes and Admiral Roger Keyes with a refined plan for a second attempt to block the port. Other officers came forward to participate and Keyes and Lynes devised an operational plan to attack the canal mouth at Ostend once again.|$|E
5|$|As mounted infantry, the {{regiment}} rode into battle on their horses but {{were expected to}} dismount and fight on foot. The regiment fought predominantly {{against the forces of}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their first engagement was in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, {{the regiment}} took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. Their early battles included Romani, Gaza and Beersheba. Later in the war, they were part of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> occupied the Jordan Valley and took part in the raids on Amman and Es Salt. Their final wartime operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army. During the four years of war, the regiment sustained 334 dead from all causes and 555 wounded, several of those more than once. After the war, the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 before it was disbanded in June 1919.|$|E
5|$|At 8:30am on 24 August, Milne Bay GHQ was alerted by an RAAF Hudson bomber near Kitava Island, off the Trobriand Islands, and coastwatchers that a Japanese convoy was {{approaching}} the Milne Bay area. – escorting the transport SS Tasman– left the Milne Bay area and sailed for Port Moresby after {{learning of the}} invasion force. Reports of the second Japanese convoy, consisting of seven barges, which had sailed from Buna carrying <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> would land at Taupota were also received at this time. In response to this sighting, after the initially poor weather had cleared, 12 RAAF Kittyhawks were scrambled at midday. The barges were spotted beached near Goodenough Island where the 350 troops of the 5th Sasebo SNLF, led by Commander Tsukioka, had gone ashore to rest. The Australian pilots then proceeded to strafe the barges and, {{over the course of}} two hours, destroyed them all and stranded their former occupants.|$|E

5|$|Australian aircrew {{supported}} the fighting on 6 June. No.453 Squadron {{was one of}} 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft. No.456 Squadron also formed part of <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> provided air defence for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that {{supported the}} landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew {{only a small number}} of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.|$|E

5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged from <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>that</b> left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, {{had been}} badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time}} of Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
