25|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{purchase of}} convertible bonds and <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> {{of the same}} issuer's common stock is a hedge fund strategy known as convertible arbitrage.

25|$|Potential loss on a {{short sale}} is {{theoretically}} unlimited, {{as there is no}} theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the short seller is required to post margin or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or counterparty to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sale.</b> In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.|$|E
40|$|When {{investors have}} {{differences}} of opinion about the payoffs of a stock, Harrison and Kreps (1978) demonstrate {{the existence of a}} speculative bubble in the stock price, that is, the stock price can exceed the valuation of the most optimistic investor. A crucial condition that supports this result in their model is that investors are not allowed to <b>short</b> sell <b>the</b> stock. This paper demonstrates that speculative bubbles may arise even without <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint. <b>The</b> paper also demonstrates that asset panics may arise, that is, the stock price may be lower than the valuations of all individual investors. In particular, even if <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint binds, asset panics can still arise. This result suggests that Miller’s (1977) insight that <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint causes <b>the</b> stock price to be above the average valuation is not robust in a dynamic framework. In the case of a bubble, our model generalizes the Harrison-Kreps notion of a resale option, namely, investors believe that they can resell the stock later at a higher price. In the case of a panic, our model develops the notion of a waiting option, namely, investors believe that they can purchase the stock later at a lower price. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – In this paper, {{the authors}} aim {{to test the}} {{assertion}} that options act {{as a substitute for}} <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> by allowing investors an alternative way to act on bearish sentiment. An empirical test of this assertion requires a researcher to observe both types of firm – those that weren’t <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constrained, as well as those that were. The authors examine the ability of options to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint directly – in an environment where the constraint is likely to differ across firms in a systematic fashion, namely the market for American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Design/methodology/approach – The authors examine 190 option introductions on ADRs over the period of 1982 to 2006. The question of how ADRs are chosen for options listing, and whether those criteria differ from those found using purely domestic options, is addressed using logistic regressions. The authors use the event study methods of Brown and Warner to examine the price effect of the listing. They use OLS regression to identify determinants of the cumulative abnormal return upon option listing. Independent variables are those indicated by existing literature that examines option listing on domestic securities. Findings – In an environment where <b>the</b> effective <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraint varies across firms, the authors find support for the contention that US option listings reduce the effect of <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint, providing relief for investors who have negative sentiment about the stock and are subject to a <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraint. However, it does not appear that option listing entities seek out companies for which <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints are stronger. Originality/value – The authors’ hypotheses {{are similar to those of}} Mayhew and Mihov and of Danielson and Sorescu, but the authors assert that the ADR market is a more robust environment in which to test the hypotheses. This is due to the potentially large variation in <b>the</b> effective <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints that results from the differences in their underlying home market legal and regulatory environments. In addition to relative <b>short</b> interest and <b>the</b> change in relative short interest, this environment allows the authors to use indicator variables to directly test the ability of options to substitute for <b>short</b> <b>sales...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> {{regulations}} issued during the financial crisis of 2008. Specifically, we study the emergency order that effectively restricted naked short selling for nineteen stocks, and the outright ban on all short selling of financial stocks. We document that both regulations were effective in reducing settlement and delivery failures. However, they also resulted in large declines in short selling, and large increases (seven-fold for the emergency order) in <b>the</b> cost of <b>short</b> selling. <b>The</b> regulations provide a unique opportunity to test the empirical implications of Diamond and Verrecchia (1987), which distinguishes between outright prohibitions on short selling and constraints on short selling that merely make them more costly. Consistent with the model, we find that both the emergency order and the ban resulted in significant reductions in market quality. Further, we find that the ban decreased liquidity and increased <b>the</b> informativeness of <b>short</b> <b>sales,</b> and that both these changes were especially strong for stocks with listed options. As sophisticated, informed traders are more likely to make use of options as a substitute for <b>short</b> <b>sales,</b> this result supports the Diamond and Verrecchia (1987) model’s prediction that some types of <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints can actually increase the information content of <b>short</b> <b>sales...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} determining the optimal ordering quantity for a perishable product to be sold over a nite sales horizon with a dynamic pricing policy. To date, most models developed to study a dynamic pricing policy for perishable products assume that the salvage value is nonnegative. In this model we allow the salvage value to be either a nonnegative or negative value. We derive {{the conditions under which}} the optimal ordering quantity takes either a zero value or nite value greater than zero. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a <b>shortest</b> <b>sales</b> horizon under a condition for which ordering of the product is protable if the seller's planned sales horizon is longer than <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>sales</b> horizon...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} example describes <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> of a security. To {{profit from}} {{a decrease in}} the price of a security, a short seller can borrow the security and sell it expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. [...] When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. [...] The process relies {{on the fact that the}} securities (or the other assets being sold short) are fungible; the term [...] "borrowing" [...] is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a car, where the same car must be returned).|$|E

Regarding the first, we show that short positions were a significant determinant of the probability of default of medium-sized banks before the ban. We find that, by weakening the contagion effect coming from the sovereign risk, the ban helped stabilise the probability of default of medium-sized banks, an effect which is not significant {{in the case of}} the largest banks and non-financials. Nonetheless, the stabilising power of the ban came at the cost of a large decline in the relative liquidity, trading volumes and price information efficiency of medium-sized banks stocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{explanation}} for relative pricing of futures contracts with respect to underlying stocks based on <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraints and informational lags between the two markets. In this model stocks and futures are perfect substitutes, except that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are only allowed in futures markets. The futures price is more informative than the stock price, because <b>the</b> existence of <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraints in <b>the</b> stock market prohibits trading in some states of the world. If an informed trader with no initial endowment in stocks gets a negative signal about the common future value of stocks and futures, she is only able to sell futures. In addition uninformed traders also face similar <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint in <b>the</b> stock market. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint, <b>the</b> stock price is less informative than the futures price even if the informed trader has received positive information. Stocks can be under- and overpriced compared to futures, provided that market makers in stocks and futures only observe with a lag the order flow in the other market. Our theory implies that 1.) the basis is positively associated with the contemporaneous futures returns, 2.) the basis is negatively associated with the contemporaneous stock return, 3.) futures returns lead stock returns, 4.) stock returns also lead futures returns, but to a lesser extent and 5.) the trading volume in the stock market is positively associated with the contemporaneous stock return. The model is tested using daily data from the Finnish index futures markets. Finland provides a good environment for testing our theory, since <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> were not allowed during the time that we have data (May 27, 1988 - May 31, 1994).
