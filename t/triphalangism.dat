40|$|We {{report a}} case of Klinefelter's {{syndrome}} owing to maternal meiotic error associated with triphalangeal thumb and delta phalanx bilaterally. There are no previous reports of similar cases and <b>triphalangism</b> with delta phalanx abnormalities of both thumbs might therefore be considered a further, but rare, manifestation of this aneuploidy...|$|E
30|$|As a final note, the {{classification}} system depicted in Fig.  3 [1] {{is not the}} original Wassel classification, as type VII {{does not appear to}} be of the triphalangeal kind. Instead, it resembles a ‘floating’ connection at the metacarpophalangeal level, a type excluded from the analysis according to the Methods section [1]. However, results for this ‘type VII’ were presented with a 0  % complication rate. On the other hand, <b>triphalangism</b> was excluded from the analysis in accordance with the Methods section. Complications linked to polydactyly with triphalangial thumbs is one of the reasons they are often described and treated as a distinct entity within the spectrum. In conclusion, analysis of <b>triphalangism</b> instead of floating components would have been adherent to the Wassel classification, although it might have led to a higher complication rate.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{our choice}} of classification, Wassel {{described}} his classification system in 1969 using Flatt’s series of patients [2]. From {{that time to}} the present day, <b>triphalangism</b> has been progressively considered a situation {{different from that of}} thumb duplication and requires a different approach. Its treatment is widely described in Green’s Operative Hand Surgery, 6 th Edition. For this reason, we used the Wassel classification as modified by Egawa [3, 4], which describes type VII as a floating thumb.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{management}} of <b>triphalangism</b> provides the age-old problem of marrying maximal functional benefit with acceptable cosmesis. The {{objective was to}} discuss the rare abnormality of bilateral triphalangeal thumb, the surgical existing surgical approaches, and to present a case in a pediatric patient who had a good result with a relatively simple and straightforward method of surgically managing the deformity. Method: We present {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old girl with isolated bilateral <b>triphalangism</b> of the thumbs. Her primary concern was the cosmetic deformity conferred by a delta middle phalanx, resulting in ulnar deviation of the thumb, in addition to the consequent reduced function of the thumb. Our approach to this problem was to perform a wedge osteotomy of the delta phalanx and a shave osteotomy of the articular surface of the distal phalanx, before using the Acutrak screw system to perform an arthrodesis. We present the first reported case in the literature. Results: This resulted in a near-anatomical correction of the deformity and consequent improvement of the cosmesis with a short anesthetic time, quick postoperative recovery, and very satisfied patient. Conclusion: We acknowledge that superior techniques exist; however, we also recognize that ever...|$|E
40|$|Cooks {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} familial congenital anonychia or onychodystrophy, hypoplasia or absence of distal phalanges of the hands and feet with brachydactyly of the fifth finger and digitalization of the thumb (<b>triphalangism).</b> It is listed as a "rare disease" by the Office of Rare Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. Here, we report a case of congenital anonychia and brachydactyly of the left foot, which possibly is a variant of Cooks syndrome with a positive family history of similar deformity...|$|E
40|$|Presence {{of one or}} more digit {{is called}} as {{polydactyly}} and may manifest singly or with other genetic disorders. The frequency of polydactyly varies widely among populations. It can occur as an isolated condition or as a feature of a congenital condition. Polydactyly is a rare condition, but still rare is in form of triple great toes. We describe a case in a 4 -year-old child diagnosed as <b>triphalangism</b> foot with no other obvious visible anomaly. Osteoplasty-combined surgery, which was ideal for anatomical reconstruction. In a 16 -month follow-up period child recovered very well...|$|E
40|$|Thumb {{polydactyly}} {{is reported}} to be the most common congenital anomaly of the hand in Japan. The floating type is not particularly rare, accounting for 0. 9 to 15 % of all cases of thumb polydactyly. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there has been only one case of thumb polydactyly with a floating ulnar thumb, reported by Onizuka. Herein, we report a case very similar to that reported by Onizuka. In our case, the vessels feeding the floating ulnar thumb branched from the superficial palmar arterial arch, and X-rays revealed <b>triphalangism.</b> In surgery, we not only reconstructed the morphology of the thumb, but also tried to preserve the sensation in the reconstructed thumb by transposing the digital nerve of the floating ulnar thumb to the radial thumb. In addition to thumb polydactyly, our case also showed hypoplasia of the thenar muscles...|$|E
40|$|Within the Oberg, Manske, Tonkin (OMT) classifi cation, thumb duplications are {{a failure}} of {{formation}} and/or differentiation affecting the radial-ulnar axis of the hand plate. The Wassel description of seven types of thumb duplication provides a good structure from which an approach to management is based. The aim of surgical reconstruction is to obtain a stable, mobile thumb of adequate size and appropriate shape. The {{most common form of}} reconstruction is removal of the lesser digit and reconstruction of the dominant digit. Surgical techniques address the problems of deviation, instability and lack of size. The disadvantages of the Bilhaut-Cloquet procedure, these being joint stiffness and a nail ridge, may be lesser concerns when reconstruction of one digit will not create a satisfactory thumb of adequate mobility, stability, alignment and size. Complicated problems of <b>triphalangism,</b> triplication, ulnar dimelia and the rare circumstance in which neither of the duplicated thumbs may be adequately reconstructed present specific challenges which demand alternative techniques...|$|E
40|$|Polydactyly is {{the most}} {{frequently}} observed congenital hand malformation with a prevalence between 5  and 19  per 10   000 live births. It can occur as an isolated disorder, in association with other hand/foot malformations, or {{as a part of}} a syndrome, and is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. According to its anatomical location, polydactyly can be generally subdivided into pre- and postaxial forms. Recently, a gene responsible for preaxial polydactyly types II and III, as well as complex polysyndactyly, has been localised to chromosome 7 q 36.  In order to facilitate the search for the underlying genetic defect, we ascertained 12  additional families of different ethnic origin affected with preaxial polydactyly. Eleven of the kindreds investigated could be linked to chromosome 7 q 36, enabling us to refine the critical region for the preaxial polydactyly gene to a region of 1. 9  cM. Our findings also indicate that radial and tibial dysplasia/aplasia can be associated with preaxial polydactyly on chromosome 7 q 36.  Combining our results with other studies suggests that all non-syndromic preaxial polydactylies associated with <b>triphalangism</b> of the thumb are caused by a single genetic locus, but that there is genetic heterogeneity for preaxial polydactyly associated with duplications of biphalangeal thumbs. Comparison of the phenotypic and genetic findings of different forms of preaxial polydactyly is an important step in analysing and understanding the aetiology and pathogenesis of these limb malformations.    Keywords: preaxial polydactyly; chromosome 7 q 36; localisatio...|$|E
