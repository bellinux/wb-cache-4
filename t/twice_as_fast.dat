40|$|International audienceHierarchical Enumerative Coding (HENUC) is a {{lossless}} compression algorithm {{used in a}} wavelet based image encoder. By manipulating the wavelet coefficients into locally stationary sequences, HENUC is demonstrated to provide good compression efficiency according to our experimental results. We extended our previous work on FPGA encoder SoC, exploiting an innovative on-chip memory access manner in the bit-plane coding using dual port, {{as well as an}} address-based data traversal technique during the coding. Performance results are based on the Altera's 40 nm Stratix IV EP 4 SGX 230 FPGA, on a DE 4 board from Terasic, where the optimized dual port HENUC architecture is implemented in a Nios II processor based system on chip. We present the resource utilization and the execution time evaluations.

The first (treatment 1) treating the sand 5 {{days before the}} event of contamination and the second (treatment 2) treated immediately after the contamination. The degradation of total TPH after 90 days ranged from 44 to 78 %. However, the first 10 days were very {{important in terms of}} degradation and it slowed down significantly until 90 days. The degradation rate for light fractions in treatment 1 was slightly slower than treatment 2. On the other hand, for heavier fractions the degradation rate of heavier fractions in treatment 1 was at least <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>faster</b> than treatment 2. Implicating that pre-treating the samples with biosolvent some days before the event of contamination may accelerate the degradation process of heavier fraction that are more difficult to degrade.

A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident.

5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{efficiency}} and treatment outcome of patients treated with corticotomy-assisted en-masse orthodontic retraction {{as compared with the}} en-masse retraction without corticotomy. Materials and Methods: Forty adult patients with bimaxillary protrusion requiring correction of bidental proclination constituted the sample. The study group consisted of 22 patients (male 11, female 11) willing to undergo surgery to reduce the duration of their orthodontic treatment and 18 patients (male 9, female 9) desirous of undergoing conventional orthodontic treatment without surgical intervention constituted the control group. Comparison of rate of retraction and anchor loss between the study and the control group was assessed. Results: Average rate of space closure of 1. 8 mm/month in the maxilla and 1. 57 mm/month in the mandible was observed in the study group compared to 1. 02 mm/month in the maxilla and 0. 87 mm/month in the mandible in the control group. The rate of retraction accelerated during the first 2 months of retraction. Molar anchor loss of approximately 0. 6 mm occurred in the study group, and 1. 8 mm occurred in the control group during the 4 months. Conclusion: The rate of retraction with study group was <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>faster</b> when compared to the control group, accelerating during the first 2 months of retraction. There was better anchorage control with the undecorticated molar segment during the retraction period but was found to increase as time advanced...|$|R

Since the deep neural network has shown its great value in vehicle detection area, people may wonder what kind of impact would be brought by the combination of IoT and deep learning techniques. In this work, an exploration of implementation of CNN (convolutional neural network) on low-power platform for smart traffic optimization has been conducted. During the research, a new optimization approach, which aims at S-CNN (Sparse Convolutional Neural Network) optimization from architecture level, has been proposed; and outstanding performance has been obtained when compared to mainstream deep learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow. In the experiments, the new proposed S-CNN optimization approach is <b>as</b> <b>twice</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> Tensorflow on 94 % sparse model and becomes 5 times faster on 98 % sparse model.

Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> as the original.

All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} incompressible, exact, non-ideal magnetorotational (MRI) modes against parasitic instabilities. Both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing-mode parasitic instabilities may occur in the dissipative regimes accessible to current numerical simulations. We suppose that a primary MRI mode saturates at an amplitude such that its fastest parasite has a growth rate comparable to its own. The predicted alpha parameter then depends critically on whether the fastest primary and parasitic modes fit within the computational domain and whether non-axisymmetric parasitic modes are allowed. Hence even simulations that resolve viscous and resistive scales may not saturate properly unless the numerical domain {{is large enough to}} allow the free evolution of both MRI and parasitic modes. To minimally satisfy these requirements in simulations with vertical background fields, the vertical extent of the domain should accommodate the fastest growing MRI mode while the radial and azimuthal extents must be <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> large.
