5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The anonymous author of A Certaine Relation says that the family {{did not wish to}} divulge <b>their</b> <b>address,</b> to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that <b>their</b> <b>address</b> would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1960s, binary {{addressing}} {{had become the}} standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two.

25|$|Butt Hole Road is {{the former}} name of a street {{in the town of}} Conisbrough, Doncaster, England, within the county of South Yorkshire. The short, {{residential}} street gained fame for its suggestive name and was frequented by tourists who would stop to take photos by its street sign. Residents living on the street experienced issues with <b>their</b> <b>address,</b> as they were refused services due to the name and were the target of pranks and jokes. After privately raising funds for a new street sign and seeking approval from the local government, residents had the name of the street changed in 2009.|$|E
25|$|He {{was able}} to stay in business, however, and the company's {{websites}} were promptly changed to state clearly that they were based in the U.S. In papers filed by his defense attorneys in response to the FTC, he claimed that the websites had not tried to hide that the company was based in California and that <b>their</b> <b>address</b> was clearly stated. He disputed some of the allegations of deceptive business practices, noting he had given refunds when products were not compatible with the British electrical system. Only 1% of all his customers, he noted, had disputed their credit card charges.|$|E

25|$|Expansion after World War II {{has been}} rapid. The rural {{municipalities}} of Tromsøysund and Ullsfjord, {{and most of}} Hillesøy, were merged with Tromsø on 1 January 1964, creating today's Tromsø municipality and almost tripling Tromsø's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Tromsøværinger (residents of Tromsø) annually. The population of Tromsø municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change <b>their</b> <b>address</b> when moving to Tromsø.|$|E

25|$|When {{questioned}} as to life at Cromwell Street, Rose {{claimed she}} and Fred had lived separate lives, although this was {{inconsistent with the}} earlier testimony of witnesses who had visited or lodged at <b>their</b> <b>address.</b> In reference to {{her relationship with her}} eldest child, Rose admitted her relations with Heather were strained, before claiming to the court her daughter was a lesbian who had physically and psychologically abused her siblings. Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and Fred had given as to Heather's disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after the girl had left home.|$|E

25|$|Discontent {{over the}} {{reintroduction}} of feudal taxes, {{combined with the}} way the constitution of 1801 was adopted, led to increased resistance from the population of the Canton du Léman during 1801. A group of Vaudois patriots assembled as early as spring 1800 in Morges to discuss the idea that if the feudal taxes were not abolished, a reunion with France was preferable to remaining in the Helvetic Republic. The Helvetic Republic seized on that argument to issue a blanket condemnation of the Vaudois patriots, who in turn signed an address that represented a first clear call to arms. <b>Their</b> <b>address</b> stated that they felt deeply attached to a Swiss nation that upheld the notions of egalitarism, liberty, and justice, but insinuated that the government was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Jamaica is the {{location}} of several government buildings including Queens Civil Court, the civil branch of the Queens County Supreme Court, the Queens County Family Court and the Joseph P.

Jamaica Center, the area around Jamaica Avenue and 165th Street, is a major commercial center, as well as the home of the Central Library of the Queens Borough Public Library. The New York Racing Association, based at Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park, lists its official address as Jamaica (Central Jamaica once housed NYRA's Jamaica Racetrack, now the massive Rochdale Village housing development). John F. Kennedy International Airport and the hotels nearby also use Jamaica as <b>their</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{partnership}} {{was converted}} into a private company, Galloways Ltd., in 1889, with a share capital of £250,000 in £100 shares.

Beckwith, MIMechE, had been a frequent co-applicant with Charles John Galloway in applications for patents and provisional protection thereof: he had joined the company in his early 20s in 1864 as a draughtsman and, after a brief interlude working for another business in Buenos Aires, returned in 1867; by 1877 he was chief design engineer and he became managing director with the conversion to limited company status; he resigned as managing director in 1897 but kept his seat {{on the board of}} directors until his death one year later.|$|E
