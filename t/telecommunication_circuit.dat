5000|$|Sending {{a message}} to a U-boat usually began with Rear Admiral DÃ¶nitz (Commander of the Submarines, German: Befehlshaber der U-Boote, abbr. BdU) who {{maintained}} tight control on U-boat operations. The Officer of the watch would take the message, timestamp it, and hand it to the duty radio technician watch officer for encryption. Fifteen to twenty radiomen worked per shift enciphering and deciphering messages. As only officers could set the rotor positions, which remained in force for two days, the watch officer set every Enigma with a new inner key, bar one, just before midnight every second day. One Engima cipher machine remained on the previous key setting to decipher late messages. After the officer completing setting the rotors, the radio technician configured the Plugboard and turned the rotors to the key. When the Engima was configured, the message was enciphered and then immediately deciphered on another Enigma {{to ensure that it}} could be read. If readable, it was sent to the appropriate location. To do that, the radio technician determined the location of the target, usually a U-boat, and the specific circuit to transmit it on (Cryptochannel, <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>circuit).</b> Naval Command had several geographical nets, the Kriegsmarine version of the German Naval Grid System ( [...] Marinequadratkarte), which were called, Amerika A, for the northern Atlantic area, Amerika B for the southern Atlantic area, Afrika 1 and 2, Ireland and others. Two other nets were also used for submarines attacking convoys, one code-named Diana, the other Hubertus. Each net had three frequencies, configured at the time of day to ensure best reception. Hubertus had six different frequencies used at different times. Occasionally a Wolfpack would get its own frequency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{reports the}} results of a case study on a given <b>telecommunication</b> <b>circuit</b> {{configuration}} paralleling to both 22 kV and 115 kV power lines by using the same utility poles. This study uses simulation Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP/ATP) to simulate and shows that during normal operation of the power system some level of differential mode voltage is present across the tip and ring conductor. Upon occurrence of a fault in 22 kV and 115 kV lines, maximum values of fault currents are calculated to be 557 and 3492 amperes respectively. The higher differential mode voltage during the occurrence of a fault in either 22 kV or 115 kV lines does not cause any potential damage. If the GDT is out of order and then have any fault in power lines system. Since induced voltage that cause from power line will building up across the conductors of telephone line and would become to common mode voltage. The analytical results on the common mode voltage due to either 22 kV or 115 kV line faults can caused serious hazard and make damage to subscriberâs telephone equipment.

40|$|AbstractâIntegrated {{circuits}} {{for very}} high-speed telecommu-nication protocols often use ASICs, {{due to their}} strict timing constraints. This scenario is changing, since modern FPGAs, implemented in 65 or 45 nm technologies achieve high operating frequencies, and serializer/deserializer hardwired modules enable the reception of high speed aggregated rates (e. g. 10 Gbps or more), spanning the input stream for internal parallel computation. This paper presents a complete solution for an Optical Transport Network framer using FPGA devices. The framer receives a 10 Gbps stream originated from optical fiber medium, extracts its payload information, and transmits payload data at 10 Gbps.

50|$|For {{direct inward dialing}} service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the PBX, the dialed telephone number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant.

40|$|The limited {{availability}} of radio frequency spectrum demands for more efficient ways to utilize it in future wireless networks. Spectrum sharing radios {{are an interesting}} solution to the spectral scarcity problem, where the available resources are adaptively used across time and frequency without affecting other user's transmissions. In this context, sensing the spectrum for its occupancy is needed to increase the awareness among technologies that share the same spectrum. In a typical wireless sensor network, each node senses and transmits data constrained by a very low power budget. At the same time, they should be capable of finding a free frequency channel with minimal latency. A {{solution to this problem}} is to make radios capable of sensing multiple frequency bands, in the order of a few hundred MHz, all at once. The technical challenge lies in the design of low-complexity wideband spectrum sensing techniques that increase context awareness at the wireless node. In this thesis, we address this problem with two approaches. The first approach is based on Compressed Sampling (CS) theory, where a new perspective is taken, different to conventional methods that estimate the spectrum and perform detection on the reconstructed spectrum. Instead a direct detection is performed on the sub-Nyquist rate sampled wideband signal. In the second part of this thesis, an alternative approach to reduce the power at an architectural level is proposed, by avoiding the Nyquist rate wideband Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and pushing the conventional digital processing to the analog domain. <b>Telecommunication,</b> <b>Circuits</b> and SystemsMicroelectronics & Computer EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
