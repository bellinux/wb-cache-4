5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because <b>they</b> <b>involve</b> communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals <b>they</b> <b>involve</b> are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by foot. On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. <b>They</b> <b>involve</b> animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
30|$|Titles and abstracts of all {{retrieved}} articles were independently analyzed by two reviewers who excluded any obviously irrelevant studies. The eligibility {{of the remaining}} articles was further assessed using full-text evaluation by the same reviewers. Disagreements between the reviewers were resolved through discussion. Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) they were RCTs, (2) <b>they</b> <b>involved</b> patients with MI, and (3) <b>they</b> <b>involved</b> CsA treatment.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} among 269 medical {{students who participated in}} educational training groups. Self-evaluation was the most important motive to engage in social comparison with other group members, followed by, respectively, self-enhancement and self-improvement. Upward comparisons (i. e., with better-performing group members), were motivated by self-improvement, particularly when <b>they</b> <b>involved</b> identification. Upward comparisons were also motivated by self-evaluation, particularly when <b>they</b> <b>involved</b> contrast. Downward comparisons (i. e., with worse-performing group members) were mainly motivated by self-enhancement, particularly when <b>they</b> <b>involved</b> contrast. Performance stress was higher the more participants identified downward, the less they identified upward, and the more they contrasted themselves upward. It is concluded that educators should pay attention to the potentially maladaptive role that social comparisons might play in training groups...|$|R

5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: <b>they</b> <b>involve</b> two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{released}} , the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, on November 28, 2005 for the Nintendo DS system. The {{plot and}} setting is relatively disconnected {{to that of}} Superstar Saga, as Cackletta {{has been replaced by}} the Shroobs as the primary antagonists. Although the game is set outside the Beanbean Kingdom, there are references to Superstar Saga in Partners in Time, such as the inclusion of Fawful in the sewers of Princess Peach's Castle in the game. The Bros. Moves have been retained in Partners in Time, although <b>they</b> <b>involve</b> an item system as opposed to the Bros. Points system that Superstar Saga has. A second sequel, , was released in 2009 for the Nintendo DS, with Fawful reprising his role as a key villain. A third sequel, , was released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. A fourth sequel, , a crossover with the Paper Mario series, was released for the 3DS in 2015.|$|E
