40|$|Unsteady flow in <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> {{has been}} widely studied {{for a number of}} {{different}} physiological applications; the principal motivation for the work of this paper is the study of blood flow in the jugular vein of an upright, long-necked subject (a giraffe). The one-dimensional equations governing gravity- or pressure-driven flow in <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> have been solved in the past using finite-difference (MacCormack) methods. Such schemes, however, produce numerical artifacts near discontinuities such as elastic jumps. This paper describes a numerical scheme developed to solve the one-dimensional equations using a more accurate upwind finite volume (Godunov) scheme that has been used successfully in gas dynamics and shallow water wave problems. The adapatation of the Godunov method to the present application is non-trivial due to the highly nonlinear nature of the pressure–area relation for <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes.</b> The code is tested by comparing both unsteady and converged solutions with analytical solutions where available. Further tests include comparison with solutions obtained from MacCormack methods which illustrate the accuracy of the present method. Finally the possibility of roll waves occurring in <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> is also considered, both as a test case for the scheme and as an interesting phenomenon in its own right, arising out of the similarity of the <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> equations to those governing shallow water flow...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} linear {{stability}} of elastic <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> conveying fluid, when the equilibrium {{configuration of the}} tube is helical. A particular case of such tubes, commonly encountered in applications, is represented by quarter- or semi-circular tubular joints used at pipe's turning points. The stability theory for pipes with non-straight equilibrium configurations, especially for <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes,</b> allowing dynamical change of the cross-section, has been elusive as {{it is difficult to}} accurately develop the dynamic description via traditional methods. We develop a methodology for studying the three-dimensional dynamics of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> based on the geometric variational approach. We show that the linear stability theory based on this approach allows for a complete treatment for arbitrary three-dimensional helical configurations of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> by reduction to an equation with constant coefficients. We discuss new results on stability loss of straight tubes caused by the cross-sectional area change.

We conjecture that Recrit corresponds to the Reynolds number beyond which <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> are capable of performing sustained self-excited oscillations. Our computations suggest a simple functional relationship between Recrit and the system parameters, and we present a scaling argument to explain this observation. Finally, we demonstrate that, {{within the framework of the}} instability mechanism analysed here, self-excited oscillations of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes</b> are much more likely to develop from steady-state configurations in which the tube is buckled non-axisymmetrically, rather than from axisymmetric steady states, which is in agreement with experimental observations...|$|R

30|$|In this {{research}} study, fluid flow through a cylindrical <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> has been investigated. Of particular {{interest is the}} effect of flow parameters on the cross sectional area of a <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube,</b> flow velocity and internal pressure of the fluid. The flow parameters considered are longitudinal tension and volumetric flow rate. The <b>tube</b> is considered <b>collapsible</b> in the transverse direction, taken to be perpendicular to the main flow direction. Collapse happens when external pressure exceeds internal pressure and hence the tube results to a highly noncircular cross sectional area. The fluid flow in consideration is steady and incompressible. Equations governing the flow are non-linear and cannot be solved analytically. Therefore an approximate solution to the equations has been determined numerically. In this case, finite difference method has been used. A computer program has then been used to generate the results which are presented in form of graphs. The results show that the longitudinal tension is directly proportional to both the cross sectional area and internal pressure and inversely proportional to the flow velocity and that change in volumetric flow rate has no effect on the cross sectional area but it is directly proportional to the flow velocity and inversely proportional to the internal pressure.|$|R

This paper presents a robust and rapidly converging procedure for {{the solution of}} the steady three-dimensional Stokes equations, coupled to the geometrically non-linear shell equations which describe the large deformations of the tube wall. The fluid and solid equations are coupled in a segregated method whose slow convergence is accelerated by an extrapolation procedure based on the scheme's asymptotic convergence behaviour. A displacement control technique is developed to handle the system's snap-through behaviour. Finally, results for the tube's post-buckling deformation and for the flow in the strongly collapsed tube are shown.

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{computer model}} has been developed to simulate fluid flow through a <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube.</b> The model {{is based on the}} immersed boundary method, which is designed to handle a flexible elastic boundary immersed in fluid. This internal boundary is both affected by and has an effect on the motion of the fluid. The setup for <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> simulation involves a fiber-wound elastic tube subjected to an upstream pressure, a downstream pressure, and an external pressure. Partial collapse is observed when the external pressure exceeds the downstream pressure but is less than the upstream pressure. The geometry of the transiently collapsing tube is observed. Collapse is generally localized near the downstream end of the tube, however, under certain conditions, it is also possible for collapse to occur at multiple discrete locations separated by regions of open tubing...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to solve}} the basic physics behind the <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> dripper design used in drip irrigation. A study was {{performed}} on the dynamics of the flow limitation of <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes.</b> Two parameters were studied: outlet hole diameter and effective length. Prototypes were made varying these parameters, and flow tests were conducted to collect data on pressure and flow rate. Introducing a valve to control the flow significantly improved the control of experiments and the ability to test for pressure compensation. It was found that the outlet hole diameter is directly correlated with outlet flow rate and activation pressure, but indirectly correlated with constancy of flow rate. The impact of effective length on flow rate is still unclear but the results show that there is a possible correlation that may depend on other factors and characteristics of the flow. by Teresa Lin.

40|$|Flow through {{thin-wall}} axisymmetric tubes {{has long}} been of interest to physiologists. Analysis {{is complicated by the}} fact that such tubes will collapse when the transmural pressure (internal minus external pressure) is near zero. Because of the absence of any body of related knowledge in other sciences or engineering, previous workers have directed their efforts towards experimental studies of flow in <b>collapsible</b> <b>tubes.</b> More recently, some attention has been given towards analytical studies. Results of an extensive series of experiments show that the significant system parameter is transmural pressure. The cross-sectional area of the tube depends upon the transmural pressure, and changes in cross-section in turn affect the flow geometry. Based on experimental studies, a lumped parameter system model is proposed for the <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube.</b> The mathematical model is simulated on a hybrid computer. Experimental data were used to define the functional relationship between cross-sectional area and transmural pressure as well as the relation between the energy loss coefficient and cross-sectional area.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{conditions}} under which discontinuous mechanical properties of a <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> can induce transcritical flows, i. e. the transition through the critical state where the speed index (analogous to the Mach or the Froude numbers for compressible and free surface flows, respectively) is one. Such a critical transition may strongly modify the flow properties, cause a significant reduction in the cross-sectional area of the tube, and limit the flow. General relationships are obtained for a short segment using a one-dimensional model under steady flow conditions. Marginal curves delimiting the transcritical regions are identified in terms of the speed index and the cross-sectional area ratio. Since there are many examples of such flows in physiology and medicine, we also analyse the specific case of prosthesis (graft or stent) implantation in blood vessels. We then compute transcritical conditions for the case of stiffness and reference area variations, considering a <b>collapsible</b> <b>tube</b> characterized by physiological parameters representative of both arteries and veins.
