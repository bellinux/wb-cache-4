40|$|Hunting {{tactics of}} potamotrygonid {{freshwater}} rays remain unreported under natural conditions. Three main foraging tactics of Potamotrygon falkneri and P. motoro are described here based on underwater observations {{in the upper}} Parana River. Both species displayed similar behaviors. The most common <b>tactic</b> <b>was</b> to undulate the disc margins close to, or on, the bottom and thus stirring the substrate and uncovering hidden preys. Another <b>tactic</b> <b>was</b> to charge upon prey concentrated in the shallows. The least common <b>tactic</b> <b>was</b> to pick out prey adhered to the substrate. The first <b>tactic</b> <b>is</b> widespread in several species of marine rays in the Dasyatidae, whereas the remainder (especially picking up prey on substrata above water surface) may be restricted to the Potamotrygonidae...|$|R

5|$|Hughes {{was killed}} in action {{on the evening of}} 7September 1940, after he intercepted a Dornier Do17 bomber taking part in a {{large-scale}} attack on London. His Spitfire crashed in a field between Sundridge and Bessels Green in Kent. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier came down in the River Darent. No.234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action. Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> believed to have played a major part in it. The strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed. He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable. It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of friendly fire from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf109. Some observers on the ground, including collier Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier on purpose. Four days after his death, No.234 Squadron was moved back to the relative quiet of Cornwall.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the same}} logic, the new right/new left {{considers}} {{the killing of}} Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the scorched earth tactics of the Chinese nationalists. Though such <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position {{that some of the}} civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued, {{particularly}} by market anarchists, that government {{intervention in the}} economy has been decidedly anti-union, even in economies like the United States or the European Union. Kevin Carson maintains that the most effective union <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> either criminalized or displaced by state policy in most countries. Trade unions established themselves through sitdown strikes, sympathy strikes, secondary boycotts, and hot cargo agreements; these <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> all illegal in most industrialized countries. Similarly, the original unions doubled as social welfare organization, using union funds to provide healthcare and pensions to workers and welfare to the unemployed. By adopting various welfare-state measures, governments made the populace less dependent on unions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tactics</b> <b>were</b> later copied {{by various}} armies of Central Europe, {{including}} {{the army of}} the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

25|$|Additionally, Professor Frank Perri {{has argued}} that police {{interviews}} with Christopher Porco were seriously flawed because police questioning procedures seemingly failed to account for Porco's probable psychopathy. Psychopaths have unusual emotional responses and feel no remorse for their misdeeds, so standard police interview <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> useless, as in the Porco case, where police failed to obtain any valuable information during questioning. According to Perri, police should study the Porco case to more productively interview potentially psychopathic suspects by using a non-confrontational approach rather than appealing to emotions.|$|E
25|$|A boxer-puncher is {{a well-rounded}} boxer {{who is able}} to fight at close range with a {{combination}} of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter), but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.|$|E

25|$|The National Defense University of Finland hasn't {{published}} any thesis {{or paper}} on the 21st century where sissi units and <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> mentioned. This might be mainly because the FDF has moved to a more flexible defense by reforming its land warfare doctrine leaving no room for tactics and strategies for regiment/company level sissi troops. After organizational changes, the FDF will provide reconnaissance (formerly sissi) training in Kainuun Prikaati, {{as well as in}} other major training formations, where they emphasise scout recon. training. That includes reconnaissance, forward observation and fire control but this training no longer leans towards special tactics, weapons, sabotage and woodland area fighting skills. However, the FDF still trains long range reconnaissance patrol units in Utti jaegare Regiment (Paratroopers, one of the elite units of the FDF) and they are trained in woodland area fighting, survival skills, unconventional methods and asymmetric tactics though the major role is geared more towards long range reconnaissance and special operations.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{in males}} {{is much more}} likely to be elicited by the threat of sexual infidelity in a female partner, in comparison to emotional involvement outside the mateship. This is primarily due to the risk female infidelity poses for male paternity, or 'genetic cuckoldry'. In other words, as fertilisation takes place within females, males do not have paternal certainty in the way that females do (females can always be certain that the offspring is theirs, whilst a male cannot). There is supporting evidence for this cross-culturally in a varied range of countries such as China, Germany, Japan and Sweden. Moreover, in physiological tests such as skin conductance and heart rate, men show greater levels of distress when asked to imagine a partner having sexual intercourse with another person. It is also worth noting that mate guarding <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be used if the partner is of high reproductive value e.g. if the female displays signs of high fertility such as youth and physical attractiveness.|$|E
25|$|The line a bowler {{chooses to}} bowl {{will depend on}} several factors: the {{movement}} he is generating on the ball, the shots the batsman is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic {{with the intention of}} dismissing the batsman bowled or lbw. It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batsman will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as the corridor of uncertainty. When done well, this line may confuse the batsman into whether to defend the ball or leave it, and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batman caught by the wicketkeeper or in the slips. Other bowling variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Dominion {{begins to}} advance, and seizes control of Deep Space Nine. After a brief retreat, Sisko executes a {{successful}} {{return to the}} space station, but the wider conflict continues. More setbacks hinder the Alpha Quadrant alliance as additional races, such as the Breen, offer their support to the Dominion. Questionable <b>tactics</b> <b>are</b> adopted {{in the search for}} victory, including the dissemination of an engineered virus among the Founders by a shadow Federation group called Section 31. A ruse involving a murder is used to enlist the help of the Romulans against the Dominion, and dissatisfactions lead the Cardassian leader, Legate Damar, to launch a successful resistance movement against his former Dominion comrades. Eventually, the Dominion is forced back to the planet Cardassia Prime where it is cut off from reinforcements. The female shapeshifter in command informs Odo that they would fight to the end to prevent any counter-attack by the alliance into the Gamma Quadrant. Odo assures her that the Federation would not do that while the other parties would be too weak to. After linking together, Odo cures the female shapeshifter of the biological disease afflicting her and the other Founders with the antidote he received and the Dominion agrees to surrender.|$|E
