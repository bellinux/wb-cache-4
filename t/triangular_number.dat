40|$|Abstract. This article {{considers}} {{the problems of}} maximum flow and minimum cost flow determining in fuzzy network. Parameters of fuzzy network are fuzzy arc capacities and transmission costs of one flow unit represented as fuzzy <b>triangular</b> <b>numbers.</b> Conventional rules of operating with fuzzy <b>triangular</b> <b>numbers</b> lead to a strong “blurring ” of their borders, resulting in loss of selfdescriptiveness of calculations with them. The following technique of addition and subtraction of fuzzy <b>triangular</b> <b>numbers</b> is proposed in the presented paper: the centers are added (subtracted) by the conventional methods, and {{the borders of the}} deviations are calculated using linear combinations of the borders of adjacent values. The fact that the limits of uncertainty of fuzzy <b>triangular</b> <b>numbers</b> should increase with the increasing of central values is taken into account. To illustrate the proposed method numerical examples are presented...|$|R

[...] The product of any numbers that are squares is {{naturally}} going to result in another square. This {{can be seen from the}} fact that a necessary and sufficient condition for a number to be square is that there should be only even powers of primes in its prime factorisation, and multiplying two square numbers preserves this property in the product.|$|E
