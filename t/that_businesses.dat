5|$|The {{report was}} the result of many {{cooperating}} agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the Miccosukee Indians have a reservation in between the park and water control devices, and they threatened to sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50million casino would not be flooded. Other special interests were also concerned <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Richard Pascale {{wrote that}} {{relentless}} change requires <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> continuously reinvent themselves. His famous maxim is “Nothing fails like success” {{by which he}} means that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today, We tend to depend on what worked yesterday and refuse {{to let go of}} what worked so well for us in the past. Prevailing strategies become self-confirming. To avoid this trap, businesses must stimulate a spirit of inquiry and healthy debate. They must encourage a creative process of self-renewal based on constructive conflict.|$|E
25|$|Carl Sewell, Frederick F. Reichheld, C. Gronroos, and Earl Sasser {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> {{were spending}} more on customer acquisition than on retention. They showed how {{a competitive advantage}} {{could be found in}} ensuring that customers returned again and again. Reicheld broadened the concept to include loyalty from employees, suppliers, distributors and shareholders. They developed techniques for estimating customer lifetime value (CLV) for assessing long-term relationships. The concepts begat attempts to recast selling and marketing into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship (called relationship selling, relationship marketing, and customer relationship management). Customer relationship management (CRM) software became integral to many firms.|$|E

50|$|Encarnation {{refers to}} Indian {{business}} houses, emphasizing multiple forms of ties among group members. Powell and Smith-Doerr state <b>that</b> a <b>business</b> {{group is a}} network of firms that regularly collaborate over a long time period. Granovetter argues <b>that</b> <b>business</b> groups refers to an intermediate level of binding, excluding {{on the one hand}} a set of firms bound merely by short-term alliances and on the other a set of firms legally consolidated into a single unit. Williamson claims <b>that</b> <b>business</b> groups lie between markets and hierarchies; this is further worked out by Douma & Schreuder. Khanna and Rivkin suggest <b>that</b> <b>business</b> groups are typically not legal constructs though some regulatory bodies have attempted to codify a definition. In the United Arab Emirates, a business group can also be known as a trade association. Typical examples are Adidas Group or Icelandair Group.|$|R
25|$|The IBM Institute for Business Value {{conducted}} a survey of 250 business leaders worldwide in 2008. The survey found out <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> have assimilated a much more strategic view, and that 68% companies reported are utilizing CSR as an opportunity {{and part of a}} sustainable growth strategy. The authors noted that while developing and implementing a CSR strategy represents a unique opportunity to benefit the company. However, only 31% of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company's CSR objectives and initiatives. The survey's authors also stated that employee engagement on CSR initiatives can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. As a result, employees tend to discard employers with a bad reputation.|$|E
25|$|In a state heavily {{reliant on}} {{continuous}} supply of gas for industrial processing, manufacturing, residential use and electricity generation, the sudden loss of almost 35% of gas supply had immediate social impacts, and significant {{short and long-term}} economic effects. Many businesses were forced to curtail or cease operations, resulting in workers being stood down or forced to take annual leave, and the government requested <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> and householders conserve energy usage. An emergency coordination committee of government and industry representatives rationed and redirected remaining gas supply sources. When many large gas users switched to diesel for power generation, {{the risk of a}} shortfall in transport fuel led to the federal government authorising the release of emergency fuel reserves stored at the Garden Island naval facility.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle ground}} between the craft {{production}} of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and knowledge transfer, which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> engineer {{their way out of}} their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on employment and employability is an externality.|$|E

500|$|The {{religious}} police, (mutawa is {{the name}} used for individual religious police, [...] the [...] "Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice" [...] {{is the name}} of the police organization) enforce Islamic codes of behavior. Numbering about 20,000 men untrained in law enforcement, the mutawa ensure that there is strict separation of the sexes in public, <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> close at prayer time, pressure women to wear traditional dress and, in some areas, prevent them from driving cars. Often accompanied by a police escort, the mutawa could order the detention and arrest of [...] "violators". Criticism of the mutawa by Saudis has grown since 2002, when 15 schoolgirls died in a fire at their school in Mecca after the mutawa allegedly prevented male rescuers from entering because the girls were not veiled. On 13 April 2016, a new regulation issued by the Saudi cabinet stripped the mutawa of their authority for pursuit, capture, interrogation or detainment of suspects, instead requiring them to report suspected crimes to the regular police.|$|E
500|$|Nash {{originally}} {{wanted to}} construct a straight boulevard in the same style seen in French cities, {{but this was not}} possible because of issues with land ownership. The final design resulted in the road being situated further west than previous plans, and Nash believed the road would run down a de facto line separating the upper classes and nobility in Mayfair with the working class in Soho. The northern section involved demolishing most of the existing Swallow Street, which had become run down and was an ideal candidate for regeneration. The road was designed to curve east between Oxford Street and Piccadilly so that it did not meet St James's Square, and the circuses allowed visual continuity down the street. [...] The central section, known as the Quadrant, was designed for [...] "shops appropriated to articles of fashion and taste," [...] and was Nash's centrepiece design of the entire street. It was built with a colonnade made out of cast-iron columns, allowing commuters to walk along the street without having to face bad weather. The various buildings along the Quadrant had different facades, which was a deliberate choice by Nash to break away from the uniform design of the previous century, as well as a pragmatic means of using what building materials were available and what clients wanted. The road was planned to end outside Carlton House in Pall Mall, the residence of the Prince of Wales. Nash insisted <b>that</b> <b>businesses</b> on the new street would be of high-quality, rivalling that of the nearby Bond Street; common trades such as butchers or greengrocers were not allowed.|$|E
