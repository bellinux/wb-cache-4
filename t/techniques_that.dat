5|$|In 1476, {{during the}} time of Leonardo's {{association}} with Verrocchio's workshop, the Portinari Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes arrived in Florence, bringing from Northern Europe new painterly <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> were to profoundly affect Leonardo, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others. In 1479, the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina, who worked exclusively in oils, travelled north on his way to Venice, where the leading painter Giovanni Bellini adopted the technique of oil painting, quickly making it the preferred method in Venice. Leonardo was also later to visit Venice.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E

5|$|Somervell {{retired from}} the Army on 30 April 1946 and moved to Ocala, Florida. His wife Anna had died in January 1942, and he had married Mrs. Louise Hampton Wartmann, a former student at Belcourt, in March 1943. Somervell {{accepted}} an offer {{to become president of}} Koppers, a Pittsburgh-based company that mined coal and manufactured and sold coal-based products. Applying the same managerial <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> he had employed in the Army, he thoroughly reorganized the company, and doubled revenues and tripled profits over the next five years.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian film {{director}} Abbas Kiarostami {{is known for}} uses of certain themes and cinematic <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> are instantly recognizable in his work, {{from the use of}} child protagonists and stories that take place in rural villages, to conversations that unfold inside cars utilizing stationary mounted cameras. He often undertook a documentary style of filmmaking within narrative works, and frequently employs contemporary Iranian poetry in dialogue, movie titles, and in the thematic elements of his pictures.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the satellite communication relies on {{a limited number of}} data points that were analysed using innovative <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> were only developed after the incident. The analysis has worked to determine useful information about in-flight events and the location of Flight370 at the 08:19MYT signal—believed to have occurred near the time of fuel exhaustion and thus is close to the final location of Flight370.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle {{occupants}} {{who wear}} seat belts {{have a lower}} incidence of TBI after a motor vehicle accident. However, if the strap is situated {{across the front of}} the neck (instead of the chest), this increases the risk of tracheal injury. Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent iatrogenic TBI, and medical practitioners can use <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as tracheotomy.|$|E
5|$|Waveguide filters were {{developed}} during World War II {{to meet the}} needs of radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators.|$|E
5|$|When Ip {{refuses to}} return to the arena, Miura grows {{impatient}} and sends the sadistic Colonel Sato along with several soldiers to find him. Sato sees Ip's wife and moves towards her. Ip defends his wife and incapacitates the three soldiers. They flee their apartment and take a room with Li Zhao's family. When the bandits return to the cotton mill, the workers fight back using the <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> Ip taught them. Ip himself arrives midway through the battle. He defeats many of the robbers and personally beats Jin Shanzhao, embarrassing him, and warns him never to harass the workers again.|$|E

5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E
5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E
