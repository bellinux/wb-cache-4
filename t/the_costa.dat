5|$|<b>The</b> <b>costa</b> (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although sometimes {{there is a small}} vein above <b>the</b> <b>costa</b> called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; <b>The</b> <b>costa</b> rarely ever branches because it is at the leading edge, which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the costal vein is perhaps a branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after <b>the</b> <b>costa</b> is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first axillary (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is flexibly united with the anterior end of the second axillary (2Ax).|$|E

5|$|The {{powerful}} {{winds of}} Hurricane John produced heavy surf and downed trees near Acapulco. The hurricane produced a 10foot (3m) storm surge in Acapulco that flooded coastal roads. In addition, John caused heavy rainfall {{along the western}} coast of Mexico, peaking at 12.5inches (317.5mm) in Los Planes, Jalisco.

5|$|Although {{many of the}} {{convective}} bands {{were already}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. As the eye moved over Mexico {{near the town of}} Majahual in <b>the</b> <b>Costa</b> Maya area, the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175mph (280km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde reading from the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of <b>the</b> <b>Costa</b> Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7N 87.8W at 0900UTC August21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12–18ft (3.7–5.5m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65in (17cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled and the cold cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane.|$|E

The Cytb data placed all studied specimens of O.couesi in a clade sister to the marsh rice rat; the mean genetic distance {{between the two groups}} was 11.30%, much larger than the distance between sister species in the related genera Melanomys and Nectomys (7.48% and 7.52%, respectively). Within the O.couesi clade, two populations from Panama and Costa Rica were successively basal to the other specimens, which fell into two large subclades—one containing animals from the Pacific seaboard from western Mexico to El Salvador and the other containing rats from the eastern seaboard from Texas to Nicaragua. The Panamanian and Costa Rican populations differed by 6.53% to 11.93% from the others and the western and eastern subclades differed by 4.41% on average. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of O.couesi as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed <b>the</b> <b>Costa</b> Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and placed some western O.couesi specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined dataset supported the western and eastern clades within O.couesi and placed <b>the</b> <b>Costa</b> Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the four groups they found within O.couesi should be recognized as distinct species. If this suggestion is followed, the eastern subclade would retain the name Oryzomys couesi, the western group would be named Oryzomys mexicanus, and the appropriate names for the Panamanian and Costa Rican species remain unclear.|$|E
