5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E
