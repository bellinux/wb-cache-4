5|$|The Platonic {{influence}} on Maximus' thought {{can be seen}} most clearly in his theological anthropology. Here, Maximus adopted the Platonic model of exitus-reditus (exit and return), teaching that humanity {{was made in the}} image of God, and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God. This emphasis on divinization or theosis helped secure Maximus' place in Eastern theology, as <b>these</b> <b>concepts</b> have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity.|$|E

In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} exact-learning classes of permutation groups and linear spaces over finite fields. <b>These</b> <b>concept</b> classes {{can be seen as}} special subclasses of the concept class of circuits. It turns out that in Angluin's exact-learning model <b>these</b> <b>concept</b> classes are learnable with equivalence queries but not learnable with membership queries, indeed not even exact learnable in a probabilistic sense. More importantly, we raise the question whether the entire power of equivalence queries is needed to learn <b>these</b> <b>concept</b> classes. In order to answer this question we introduce the notion of a teaching assistant. Intuitively speaking, the exact learning model comprising of the teacher and learner, is enhanced to include an intermediate teaching assistant with which the learning algorithm communicates.

5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among <b>these</b> <b>concepts</b> {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. <b>These</b> <b>concepts</b> seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E
5|$|Several states {{claimed to}} be the Roman Empire's successors {{after the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire, an attempt to resurrect the Empire in the West, was {{established}} in 800 when Pope LeoIII crowned Frankish King Charlemagne as Roman Emperor on Christmas Day, though the empire and the imperial office did not become formalized for some decades. After the fall of Constantinople, the Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire's Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second). <b>These</b> <b>concepts</b> are known as Translatio imperii.|$|E

The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of <b>these</b> <b>concepts</b> were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of British {{colonization}} of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did not engage in agriculture, despite evidence to the contrary. In 1969, the archaeologist Rhys Jones proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning {{as a way of}} enhancing natural productivity, what has been termed fire-stick farming. In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the Gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years. The archaeologist Harry Lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia, a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. <b>These</b> <b>concepts</b> led the historian Bill Gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.|$|E
