5|$|Some species, such {{as white}} peacocks, swans and geese, are not {{believed}} to be true albinos, as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> red eyes, rather, their colouration is suggested to be {{the expression of a}} white fur or feather gene, not a lack of melanin.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on the ocean and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an immediate common ancestor. They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding.|$|E
5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, scorpions, and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton.

A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
