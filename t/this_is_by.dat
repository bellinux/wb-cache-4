5|$|At the {{entrance}} to the south transept is the organ. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> Forster and Andrews, of Hull. This organ building company was formed by James Alderson Forster (1818–1886) and Joseph King Andrews (1820–1896). The business developed and {{became one of the most}} successful of the North of England organ builder. The business was taken over by John Christie in 1924 and finally wound up in 1956. As well as their Hull headquarters, the company had branches in London and York. The organ dates from 1885. It was a gift from Sir Pryse Pryse, Bt DL JP, of Gogerddan. The organ has a pine case, and painted pipes.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E

25|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{conflict}} amounted to approximately 1,000 Afghans killed in action, while the British and Indian forces lost 1,751. Of these, 236 {{were killed in}} action, 615 wounded, 566 died from cholera, and 334 {{died as a result}} of other diseases and accidents. Regardless of casualties, the outcome of the Third Anglo-Afghan War remains contentious. Ostensibly, the result of the conflict was a British tactical victory. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> virtue of the fact that the British repulsed the Afghan invasion and drove them from Indian territory, while Afghan cities were subjected to attack by Royal Air Force bombers. Nevertheless, the Afghans were ultimately able to secure their strategic political goals in the aftermath of the conflict. Thus the extent of the British tactical victory was limited, and the Afghans also made strategic gains.|$|E
25|$|An example can {{be found}} in {{personality}} or temperament models. For example, a model that was derived from linguistic expressions of individual differences is subdivided into the Big Five personality traits, where everyone can be assigned a score along each of the five dimensions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> contrast to models of 'personality types' or temperament, where some have a certain type and some do not. Similarly, in the classification of mental disorders, a dimensional approach, which is being considered for the DSM-V, would involve everyone having a score on personality trait measures. A categorical approach would only look for {{the presence or absence of}} certain clusters of symptoms, perhaps with some cut-off points for severity for some symptoms only, and as a result diagnose some people with personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|Models like PB and GB allow {{estimation}} of the mean electrostatic free energy but do {{not account for the}} (mostly) entropic effects arising from solute-imposed constraints on the organization of the water or solvent molecules. This is termed the hydrophobic effect and is {{a major factor in the}} folding process of globular proteins with hydrophobic cores. Implicit solvation models may be augmented with a term that accounts for the hydrophobic effect. The most popular way to do <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> taking the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) as a proxy of the extent of the hydrophobic effect. Most authors place the extent of this effect between 5 and 45 cal/(Å2 mol). Note that this surface area pertains to the solute, while the hydrophobic effect is mostly entropic in nature at physiological temperatures and occurs on the side of the solvent.|$|E

25|$|In {{a game of}} cricket, the {{ultimate}} priority of the fielding side is to restrict {{the total number of}} runs scored by the batting side, and the actions of the bowlers will be fundamental to achieving this objective. The primary means of achieving <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> dismissing the batting side by getting all ten of the opposition wickets as quickly as possible. A secondary objective will be to keep the batting side's run rate as low as possible. In fact, in most forms of cricket, the twin aims of the fielding side are targeted concurrently, as the achievement of one aim tends to have a positive effect upon the other. Taking regular opposition wickets will remove the better batsmen from the crease, typically leading to a slowing of the scoring rate. Conversely, slowing the scoring rate can put additional pressure on the batsmen and force them into taking extra risks, which will often lead to wickets.|$|E
25|$|This {{election}} {{is the last}} election - presidential, local and general - scheduled in Turkey until 2019. Arguments as to whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> chance, {{or whether it was}} planned by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government when they proposed to reduce the parliamentary terms from five years to four in the 2007 constitutional referendum, are still ongoing. Speculation as to what the AKP government will do during four years of electorally unchecked power should they win generated both favourable predictions and concerns. While four years without elections may allow the government to undertake widespread necessary economic reforms, critics of the AKP argue that it is an opportunity to further erode the diminishing checks and balances and separation of powers in the Turkish political and legal systems. The AKP also support a presidential system, which would give greater powers to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.|$|E
25|$|Although absent or rare in {{some areas}} where the golden eagle occurs, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>by</b> far the most {{significant}} family of birds in the diet of golden eagles, making up 10.3% of their known prey. In Scandinavia and the Baltic States, grouse are the primary prey for these eagles, comprising between 47.6% and 63.3% of their diet, and displacing mammals altogether. The main prey species in most of this sizeable area is the largest species of grouse, the western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), supplemented by its cousins, the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia). However, in the northernmost parts of Scandinavia, these are replaced by the smaller willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta). A study in Belarus showed grouse were the most common family of prey at 47.8% of the eagle diet. In Estonia, the prey base is more varied, but grouse were still the most represented bird family, comprising 18.1%. The red grouse, a race of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus scotica), and the rock ptarmigan (also called just ptarmigan) occur heavily in the golden eagle's diet in parts of Scotland, up to 47.8% in one study. One paper in Alaska showed that the two ptarmigan species (primarily the more abundant willow) made up 49.1% of the remains in a golden eagle pair's nest, making it the only known study in North America where birds were more prevalent in the diet than mammals. Other reports from Alaska show the willow ptarmigan as secondary prey. In some other areas, grouse are taken only as supplemental prey. A study in the Italian Alps revealed grouse made up 19.4% of nest remains and were the most common avian prey. In eastern Washington state, sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus) was the second most significant prey species (at 13%) after yellow-bellied marmot. Considered globally, {{it is likely that}} every species of grouse is prey of the golden eagle at least somewhere.|$|E
