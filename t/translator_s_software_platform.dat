40|$|As the {{significant}} {{role of the}} <b>software</b> <b>platform</b> in the smart phone is now propagating beyond the mobile industry, the <b>software</b> <b>platform</b> is evolving to provide unified multi-screen service facilities over different types of devices such as digital TV and Set-Top Box (STB). However, the application-specific hardware architectures impose difficulties for providing unified <b>software</b> <b>platform</b> for heterogeneous devices. This paper analyzes the differences between mobile and TV/STB System-On-Chip (SoC) architecture and proposes a unified hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to support integration of the <b>software</b> <b>platform</b> on different devices. For the evaluation and demonstration of the proposed design, the unified HAL {{is applied to the}} mobile Android platform to implement multi-screen services...|$|R
