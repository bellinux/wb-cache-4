It made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish... but now, father, we see you drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat animal, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.|$|E

I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E

Either he was drunk or he enjoyed killing civilians." [...] Abdul Samad, a 60-year-old farmer who lost eleven family members, eight of whom were children, spoke about the incident: [...] "I don't know why they killed them. Our government <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{come back to the}} village, and then they let the Americans kill us." [...] One grieving mother, holding a dead baby in her arms, said, [...] "They killed a child, was this child the Taliban? Believe me, I haven't seen a two-year-old member of the Taliban yet." ...|$|E

500|$|For the Astral Weeks sessions, {{apparently}} {{they did not}} employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians. [...] "What stood out in my mind {{was the fact that}} he allowed us to stretch out," [...] recalls Berliner. [...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go ahead and play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. [...] "I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," [...] says Berliner.|$|E
500|$|On October 14, West, in {{collaboration}} with Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft, hosted a promotional album listening event at Ace Gallery. Over 700 guests were invited to preview the entirety of 808s & Heartbreak. Under Beecroft's guidance, the event featured approximately forty nude women wearing nothing besides wool masks who silently {{stood in the center}} of the room. The women were illuminated by multicolored lights that would change as the music progressed. When it came time for him to speak, West stated that he'd been a fan of Beecroft's work and strong imagery, saying that he liked the idea of nudity because [...] "society <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> wear clothes at a certain point". Beecroft had been contacted a month prior and conceptualized and generated the installation in a week. Beecroft admitted that while he had caught her offguard, she had the opportunity to hear the album for herself and heard things that touched her own life. Five days later, promotional photos for the album by photographer Willy Vanderperre were released. The images portrayed West wearing a grey glen plaid suit, large browline glasses, and a heart-shaped pin.|$|E

So I had to shut it all off...I can shut off {{everything}} in my body, practically, physically. I saw them killing people right in front of me, the blood was there, but I didn't smell it. I made myself numb...The killing was unbearable. You go crazy if you smell the blood." ...|$|E

In 1996, the National Park Service made plans to remove cattle that were illegally trespassing in Lake Mead NRA. O'Neill recalls veiled threats similar to those made against government workers during the 2014 round-up.

2500|$|On October 4, 2012, Daulerio {{posted a}} short clip of Hulk Hogan and Heather Clem, the estranged wife of radio {{personality}} Bubba the Love Sponge, having sex.

2500|$|Based upon Computer Artworks' 2000 {{video game}} Evolva, Universal {{invited them to}} make a pitch for the game.

The pitch impressed Universal sufficiently, and the deal was signed. According to the game's director, William Latham, [...] "Universal were very good to work with. They <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> come up with original ideas. It wasn't like a Harry Potter license. There weren't strict guidelines, as long as we retained the quality of the original work." [...] Drawing inspiration from Aliens, the 1956 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Half-Life and Area 51 conspiracy theories, Computer Artworks began work on the game in November 2000. On January 16, they announced the game would also be released for Windows, with a release date slated for mid-2002. The game was first shown at Universal Interactive's [...] "Gamer's Day" [...] on August 13, where it was confirmed it would also be coming to PlayStation 2. A non-playable demo was shown, and a Q session was held with the developers. Universal revealed details of the fear/trust and infection systems, which they said would form an integral aspect of the basic gameplay.|$|E
