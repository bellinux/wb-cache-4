5|$|Abul Ala {{was born}} in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nuʿman, Syria, {{near the city of}} Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, and was during the Golden Age of Islam. He {{was a member of the}} Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Maʿarra, {{belonging}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.|$|E
5|$|After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher {{published}} {{a series of}} works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> part of these writings.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{the city}} allowed the National Park Service to take {{custody of the}} bell, while {{retaining}} ownership. The bell {{was used as a}} symbol of freedom during the Cold War and was a popular site for protests in the 1960s. It was moved from its longtime home in Independence Hall to a nearby glass pavilion on Independence Mall in 1976, and then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Liberty Bell Center adjacent to the pavilion in 2003. The bell has been featured on coins and stamps, and its name and image have been widely used by corporations.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|Best {{remembered the}} Indra {{as being a}} {{depressing}} place that {{was filled with a}} few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit. After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E

5|$|Brunel envisaged the GWR {{continuing}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean {{and built the}} SS Great Western to carry the railway's passengers from Bristol to New York. Most traffic for North America soon switched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> port of Liverpool (in LNWR territory) but some transatlantic passengers were landed at Plymouth and conveyed to London by special train. Great Western ships linked Great Britain with Ireland, the Channel Islands and France.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ridgely {{was built}} in 1853–1854 near the Dakota {{reservation}} in southwestern Minnesota, near modern New Ulm. It was named by U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis in honor of three army officers named Ridgely {{who had died in}} the Mexican-American War. The fort was created to watch over the Minnesota River Valley, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> frontier. It replaced Fort Doge in Iowa, which was decommissioned during the same period. The fort operated as a military post until 1867.|$|E

5|$|However, under Barroso, the Commission {{began to}} lose ground <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role.

5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Gorgosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} weighing {{more than}} two metric tons as an adult; dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. Gorgosaurus was most closely related to Albertosaurus, and more distantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Tyrannosaurus. Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by subtle differences in the teeth and skull bones. Some experts consider G. libratus to be a species of Albertosaurus; this would make Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of that genus.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, curry grew {{increasingly}} popular in Britain owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of British civil servants and military personnel {{associated with the}} British Raj.

5|$|Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter was {{released}} in arcades in 1997. It was then ported to the Sega Saturn in 1998 and PlayStation in 1999.

It was also responsible for introducing character assist moves to the franchise, a gameplay element which would influence future Marvel vs. Capcom installments.|$|E
5|$|Mogadishu is a {{multi-ethnic}} city. Its original core population {{consisted of}} Bushmen aboriginals, and later Cushitic, Arab and Persian migrants. The mixture of these various groups produced the Benadiri or Reer Xamar (“People of Mogadishu”), a composite population unique <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Benadir region. In the colonial period, European expatriates, primarily Italians, would {{also contribute to}} the city's cosmopolitan populace.|$|E
5|$|Not listed {{is perhaps}} the most notable 'acquisition', the 2001 merger with Time Warner to become AOL Time Warner. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> market {{capitalization}} of AOL, it gained ascendancy in the merger, with its executives largely displacing Time Warner's despite AOL's far smaller assets and revenues. AOL was spun off as its own independent company from Time Warner in 2009.|$|E

His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy {{within the framework of the}} empire.|$|E
