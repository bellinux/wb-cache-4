40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} to detect {{denominations}} of Indian coins. Counting the coins manually, collected in large amount, such as coins collected at Indian temples is difficult. This can be made easy with the proposed method of coin detection, where scanning of the coin from both the sides is considered while passing the coin through conveyer belt. By selecting {{one of the two}} images acquired, we proceed further with application of segmentation technique. <b>Traversing</b> <b>row</b> wise and column wise through the image acquired, centre and the radius of the coin is obtained. Database image is then selected for comparison based on the radius matching. The methodology proposed here used reduction technique that is the input image is reduced by the database image repeatedly, by rotating it with a fixed angle each time. Next, by plotting the graph of resultant values gives decision whether the coin match found or not, by comparing the minima to the fixed threshold. Denomination of the coin is verified by comparing coin from both the sides. Thus, the method proposed here is rotation invariable, also, by using two way scanning and comparison of coin, method determine the denomination accurately, even if the database is having different coins with same radius...|$|R

50|$|In Algorithm X, {{rows and}} columns are {{regularly}} eliminated from and {{restored to the}} matrix. Eliminations are determined by selecting a column and a row in that column. If a selected column doesn't have any rows, the current matrix is unsolvable and must be backtracked. When an elimination occurs, all columns for which the selected row contains a 1 are removed, along with all rows (including the selected row) that contain a 1 {{in any of the}} removed columns. The columns are removed because they have been filled, and the rows are removed because they conflict with the selected row. To remove a single column, first remove the selected column's header. Next, for each row where the selected column contains a 1, <b>traverse</b> the <b>row</b> and remove it from other columns (this makes those rows inaccessible and is how conflicts are prevented). Repeat this column removal for each column where the selected row contains a 1. This order ensures that any removed node is removed exactly once and in a predictable order, so it can be backtracked appropriately. If the resulting matrix has no columns, then they have all been filled and the selected rows form the solution.|$|R

40|$|With commercially-available multi-anode {{microchannel}} plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMT) and electronics, resolutions {{significantly better than}} 10 psec have been achieved in small systems with a few readout channels[1, 2]. For large-scale time-of-flight systems used in particle physics, which may cover tens of square meters, a solution must be found with a manageable number of electronics channels and low total power consumption on the readout electronics without degrading the system timing resolution. We present here {{the design of a}} transmission-line readout for a Photonis Planacon MCP-PMT that has these characteristics. The tube, which is 5 cm square, is characterized by signal pulse rise times in the order of 200 psec and transit time spreads (TTS) in the order of 25 psec[1, 2]. The model 85011 - 011 MCP has 1024 anode pads laid out in an array of 32 by 32 {{on the back of the}} tube. The proposed readout is implemented on a Rogers 4350 B printed circuit board with 32 parallel 50 -ohm transmission lines on 1. 6 mm centers, each <b>traversing</b> one <b>row</b> of 32 pads. The board is connected with conductive epoxy to the 1024 anodes of the tube, each transmission line being read out on each end. We have simulated the electrical properties of the transmission-line readout board with Hyperlynx and Spice simulators. The simulations predict that the readout transmission-lines can achieve a signal bandwidth of 3. 5 GHz, which should not significantly degrade the time and spatial resolutions intrinsic to the MCP-PMT signals...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A three-stage turbine {{designed}} for high stage loading {{has been tested}} cold {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions and the test results have been compared with calculated performance figures. Inter-blade <b>row</b> <b>traverses</b> have demonstrated the development of flow in a multi-stage turbine and have provided direct measurements of stator blade loss coefficients. The relatively poor efficiency of the turbine is shown to be due to excessive losses in the rotor blade rows~ It is believed that these high losses are the result of the camber-line form used in defining the profile at theroot (low reaction) station. 1. 0. Introduction. In the design of a contemporary aero-engine the task of the turbine designer is not unfortunately that of simply designing a turbine of high efficiency, but of producing a design which for the particular engine and application will give the best compromise between'the rival_ claims of efficiency and many other factors such as size, weight and blade cooling. These all influence the geometry of the turbine stage and it is therefore necessary that the effelct of each variable in th...|$|R
5000|$|Applying this access {{strategy}} to B-tree indexes can also combine range queries on multiple columns. In this approach, a temporary in-memory bitmap is created with one bit for each {{row in the}} table (1 MiB can thus store over 8 million entries). Next, the results from each index are combined into the bitmap using bitwise operations. After all conditions are evaluated, the bitmap contains a [...] "1" [...] for rows that matched the expression. Finally, the bitmap is <b>traversed</b> and matching <b>rows</b> are retrieved. In addition to efficiently combining indexes, this also improves locality of reference of table accesses, because all rows are fetched sequentially from the main table. The internal bitmap is discarded after the query. If {{there are too many}} rows in the table to use 1 bit per row, a [...] "lossy" [...] bitmap is created instead, with a single bit per disk page. In this case, the bitmap is just used to determine which pages to fetch; the filter criteria are then applied to all rows in matching pages.|$|R
40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of the Internet and computer technology in recent years, the use of visual information on the World Wide Web has become more popular. There has been a trend in retrieving images {{on the basis of}} automatically-derived features such as color and shape. Conducting the image retrieval by query image has attracted plenty of attention from researchers in the field of information technology. The CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval) technique refers to the image retrieval operation based on the key primitives. Despite the fact that the CBIR technique has been accepted and imple-mented in many application domains, extracting images of their contents is really an ar-duous job. The difficulty is determining how to organize these image features in some fashion without consuming too much time. In this paper, a novel MOT (Mesh Of Trees) based CBIR system is proposed. It makes use of dual image signatures to more effi-ciently provide better query results. Images are preprocessed and indexed by means of both color histogram and wavelet image signatures, and “similar ” images are adjacently stored in a two-dimensional MOT. With superb <b>traversing</b> capabilities in <b>rows</b> and col-umn trees, the architecture is very effective in accommodating dual image features. For higher dimensional image feature vectors and massive image databases, the experimental results show that the proposed architecture achieves its superior performance figures in comparisons of other existing systems...|$|R
40|$|Powerline {{rights-of-way}} (ROWs) {{often provide}} habitat for early successional bird species that have suffered long-term population declines in eastern North America. To {{determine how the}} abundance of shrubland birds varies with habitat within ROW corridors and with land use patterns surrounding corridors, we ran Poisson regression models on data from 93 plots on ROWs and compared regression coefficients. We also determined nest success rates on a 1 -km stretch of ROW. Seven species of shrubland birds were common in powerline corridors. However, the nest success rates for prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) were < 21 %, which is too low to compensate for estimated annual mortality. Some shrubland bird species were more abundant on narrower ROWs or at sites with lower vegetation or particular types of vegetation, indicating that vegetation management could be refined to favor species of high conservation priority. Also, several species were more abundant in <b>ROWs</b> <b>traversing</b> unfragmented forest than those near residential areas or farmland, indicating that corridors in heavily forested regions may provide better habitat for these species. In the area where we monitored nests, brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) occurred more frequently close to a residential area. Although ROWs support dense populations of shrubland birds, those in more heavily developed landscapes may constitute sink habitat. ROWs in extensive forests may contribute more to sustaining populations of early successional birds, and thus {{may be the best}} targets for habitat management...|$|R
