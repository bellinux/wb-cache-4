25|$|At {{around this}} time, the Eagle engine was {{cancelled}} {{and it was}} found that there were insufficient pre-production engines available to complete all the prototype and pre-production aircraft. Specification N.12/45 was therefore issued for the Wyvern TF.2, to be powered by a turboprop engine: either the Rolls-Royce Clyde or the Armstrong Siddeley Python. A single Clyde-powered prototype was ordered along with two with Pythons. A Clyde-powered TF.2 first flew on 18 January 1949. Both the piston-powered and turboprop versions shared many common components including wing and tail units, and essentially the same basic cockpit structure. The flight was cut short to only three minutes when shortly after takeoff, the cockpit filled with smoke from a fuel leak onto the exhaust ducting. Clyde development was subsequently cancelled by Rolls-Royce after only 50 hours of flight time for the TF.2, and the aircraft was delivered to Napier & Son to be fitted with the Nomad <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engine.</b> The latter engine never materialised, however and this aircraft was used for crash barrier trials.|$|E

This engine was static tested at [...] and was planned for installation in an XP-63H aircraft. The {{end of the}} war ended this development, so this promising experiment never flew. The extra power of this version was derived from using exhaust turbines, not to drive a turbo-supercharger, but to return that energy to turning the crankshaft, called a <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The VD-4K, {{originally}} {{designated as}} the M-253K, was a development of the post-war VD-3TK (M-251K) engine. Like Nazi Germany's experimental Junkers Jumo 222 multibank wartime engine, but in a larger displacement figure — at nearly 59.5 litres — than any planned or tested development of the German powerplant, the VD-4K had six monobloc banks, each with four liquid-cooled cylinders. Three blow-down exhaust, also known as power-recovery, turbines were fitted between the cylinder banks, and a geared centrifugal supercharger and a turbocharger were fitted to the engine itself, which made the VD-4K a <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|When introduced, the K-series was {{available}} with Euro IV-compliant 8.9-litre (8867 cc) 5-cylinder engines (DC9) with output of 230 hp (1050 Nm), 270 hp (1250 Nm) and 310 hp (1550 Nm) {{as well as}} the 11.7-litre (11705 cc) 6-cylinder engines (DC12) with output of 340 hp (1700 Nm), 380 hp (1900 Nm), 420 hp (2100 Nm) or 470 hp (2200 Nm), the latter being a DT12 <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engine.</b> For the 5- and 6-cylinder engines Scania is using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to fulfill the legal Euro emission standards.|$|E
50|$|The Dobrynin VD-4K was a Soviet six-bank, 24-cylinder, <b>turbo-compound,</b> inline <b>engine</b> {{developed}} {{after the}} end of World War II. It was superseded by turboprop engines before it could be widely used.|$|R
50|$|The DC-7 wing {{was based}} on the DC-4's, with the same span; the {{fuselage}} was 40 inches longer than the DC-6B. Four eighteen-cylinder Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone <b>Turbo-Compound</b> <b>engines</b> provided power. The prototype flew in May 1953 and American received their first DC-7 in November, inaugurating the first nonstop east-coast-to-west-coast service in the country (unrealistically scheduled just under the eight-hour limit for one crew) and forcing rival TWA to offer a similar service with its Super Constellations. Both aircraft frequently experienced inflight engine failures, causing many flights to be diverted. Some blamed this on the need for high power settings to meet the notional schedules, causing overheating and failure of the engines' power recovery turbines.|$|R
500|$|In 1954, a licence {{was issued}} to Canadair {{to build the}} {{derivative}} Canadair CL-28/CP-107 Argus, and the Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon. Based on the Britannia, {{the design of the}} Argus maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft was optimised for endurance on long-range patrol, not speed, and used four Wright R-3350-32W <b>Turbo-Compound</b> <b>engines</b> that used less fuel at low altitude. Unlike its Britannia forebear, the Argus was a hybrid using the Britannia wings, tail surfaces and landing gear matched to a [...] "purpose-built", unpressurised fuselage. Another significant departure was being [...] "Americanized", substituting North American materials and standard parts for the British ones. The interior was well equipped with the tools to conduct anti-submarine warfare: navigation, communication and tactical electronic equipment along with weapon loads that included bombs, torpedoes, mines and depth charges. A total of 33 Argus aircraft were built in two series (Mk 1 and Mk 2), serving the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Forces from 1957 to 1982.|$|R
50|$|A <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{reciprocating}} engine that employs a turbine to recover {{energy from the}} exhaust gases. The turbine is usually mechanically connected to the crankshaft, as on the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone engines fitted to Douglas DC-7B and the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation airliners, but electric and hydraulic power recovery systems have been investigated as well. Recovery turbines increase {{the output of the}} engine without increasing its fuel consumption, thus reducing the specific fuel consumption. Turbo-compounding was used for commercial airliners and similar long-range, long-endurance roles before the introduction of high-bypass turbofan engines replaced them in this role.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{is used to}} predict {{the performance of a}} turbocharged diesel engine with a partially insulated combustion chamber. The model is briefly described, with emphasis on heat transfer aspects and prediction of combustion chamber surface temperatures. First the trade-off between performance improvement (efficiency) degree of insulation, combustion chamber surface temperature and exhaust gas energy is examined. I t is shown that the high surface temperatures in the cylinder, due to insulation, cause volumetric efjiciency to fall. However, this reduction is offset by increased boost pressure from the turbocharger due to greater exhaust gas energy. The contribution to overall reduction in heat loss from cylinder head, piston and liner and their effect on engine efjiciency are presented and discussed. Various turbo-compound systems are examined and it is shown that most systems become unmatched when working over the wide speed and load range necessary for vehicle application, unless a variable geometry turbine or a variable ratio gearbox (this maintains compound power at part load) are used. Furthermore, substantial overall pe*formance benejits can only be obtained with very efficient turbomachinery. Rankine bottoming cycles are more effective than jixed geometry turbo-compounding at low load, but their normal efficiency is limited by high condenser temperature, and they would be difficult to install in a compact European truck. It is concluded that the ultimate improvement in engine specific fuel consumption of an adiabatic <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engine</b> is 20 per cent (excluding the savings from fan and water pump). However, drastically new design concepts are necessary, ifengines are to be built that approach this degree of insulation. Meanwhile redesigned conventional engine types will offer substantial reduction in cooling system requirements with more modest thermal ejiciency benefits. ...|$|E
500|$|Neither the Tu-4 nor the Tupolev Tu-80 {{were true}} {{intercontinental}} strategic bombers as they both lacked the range {{to attack the}} United States from bases in the Soviet Union and return. The Tu-85 was designed to achieve the necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel-efficient engines, a redesigned wing to increase the lift/drag ratio {{and the addition of}} more fuel. A large number of engines were considered before settling on the [...] Shvetsov ASh-2K, essentially two air-cooled ASh-82 radial engines paired together and the liquid-cooled [...] Dobrynin VD-4K six-bank inline engine, similar in configuration to the failed German Junkers Jumo 222. Both engines were given turbochargers and power-recovery turbines which converted them into <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engines.</b> The Shvetsov design was preferred, but was not yet mature enough for use, and the VD-4K was selected. A lot of effort was put into refining the design of the wing in collaboration with TsAGI. It had an aspect ratio of 11.745 and a taper of 2.93 for optimum lift at high-altitudes. The Tu-85 carried [...] of fuel in 48 flexible tanks.|$|R
25|$|The first {{production}} B-50A (there were no prototypes, as the aircraft's {{engines and}} new tail {{had already been}} tested) made its maiden flight on 25 June 1947, with a further 78 B-50As following. The last airframe of the initial order was held back for modification to the prototype YB-50C, a planned version to be powered by R-4360-43 <b>turbo-compound</b> <b>engines.</b> It {{was to have a}} longer fuselage, allowing the two small bomb bays of the B-29 and the B-50A {{to be replaced by a}} single large bomb bay, more suited to carrying large nuclear weapons. It would also have longer span wings, which required additional outrigger wheels to stabilize the aircraft on the ground. Orders for 43 B-54s, the planned production version of the YB-50C, were placed in 1948, but the program was unpopular with Curtis LeMay, commander of Strategic Air Command (SAC), as being inferior to the Convair B-36 and having little capacity for further improvement, while requiring an expensive redevelopment of air bases owing to the type's undercarriage. The B-54 program was therefore canceled in April 1949, work on the YB-50C being stopped prior to it being completed.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} 2014 season, Formula 1 {{switched}} to a new 1.6 liter turbocharged V6 formula that uses <b>turbo-compounding.</b> The <b>engines</b> use a single turbocharger that is connected to an electric motor/generator called the MGU-H. On deceleration, the MGU-H acts as a generator, converting wasted mechanical energy from the turbine into electrical energy that is stored in a battery. When the car accelerates, the MGU-H acts as a motor, using the stored electrical energy to spool up the turbine, eliminating lag.|$|R
