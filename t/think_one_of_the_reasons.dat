2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Live Through This began on October 8, 1993 at Triclops Sound Studios in Marietta, Georgia. The studio was booked at {{the recommendation of}} The Smashing Pumpkins, who had recorded their second studio album, Siamese Dream (1993) there. The assigned producers were Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade. The first week of recording was spent recording basic tracks, including drums, bass, scratch guitars, and scratch vocals. After basic tracks were completed, Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, joined the band in-studio before Nirvana were set to tour to promote In Utero. Cobain was presented with the basic tracks and the band invited Cobain to sing on a few unfinished numbers. Cobain initially refused, due to being unfamiliar with the material. When Cobain asked, [...] "how can I sing on it if I haven't heard it?," [...] Love answered by encouraging him to [...] "just sing {{off the top of}} [...] head." [...] Cobain is known to have provided backing vocals to [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest," [...] however Kolderie has said Cobain [...] "sang on about five or so , probably [...] "Violet", [...] "Miss World" [...] and [...] "Doll Parts, I can't remember any of the others." [...] After taking a break for dinner, the session devolved into a [...] "formless jam" [...] with Cobain on drums, Love and Erlandson on guitars and producer Sean Slade on bass. Dana Kletter (blackgirls, Dish, Dear Enemy) was asked to sing backing vocals on the record, and appears on seven songs, including Violet, Miss World, Asking For It, Doll Parts, Softer Softest, and She Walks On Me. Producer Sean Slade said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that Doll Parts might have been a hit is that harmony Dana does on the You will ache like I ache part, it's almost like an Appalachian close harmony against what Courtney is doing. It's very melancholic." [...] There have been rumors that Kletter did more than sing backing vocals, but the band denies it.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> is that I have so allowed {{silence and}} {{separation}} to accumulate--the effort of {{breaking through the}} mass becomes in that case so formidable; the mass being thus the monstrous mountain that blocks up the fair scene and {{that one has to}} explain away. I am engaged in that effort at the present moment, however--I am breaking through the mass, boring through the mountain, I feel, as I put pen to paper--and this, too, though I don't, though I shan't, though I can't particularly [...] "explain." [...] And why should I treat you at this time of day--or, to speak literally, of night--as if you had begun suddenly {{not to be able to}} understand without a vulgar demonstration on the blackboard? As I should never dream of resorting to that mode of public proof that I tenderly and unabatedly love you, so why should I think it necessary to chalk it up there that there was, all those strange weeks and months during which I made you no sign, an absolute inevitability in the graceless appearance? I call them strange because of the unnatural face that they wear to me now--but they had at the time the deadliest familiar look; the look of all the other parts of life that one was giving up and doing without--even if it didn't resemble them in their comparative dismissability. From them I learned perforce at last to avert my head, whereas there wasn't a moment of the long stretch during which I never either wrote or wired you for generous leave to come down to tea or dinner or both, there wasn't a moment when I hadn't, from Chelsea to Windsor, my eyes fondly fixed on you. You seemed rather to go out of their reach when I was placed in some pretended assurance that you had left Qu'acre for Scotland, but now that I hear, by some equally vague voice of the air, that you are still at home--and this appears more confirmed to me--I have you intensely before me again; yes, and so vividly that I even make you out as sometimes looking at me. I think in fact it's a good deal the magnanimous sadness I so catch from you that makes me feel to-night how little longer I can bear my own black air of having fallen away while I yet really and intensely stick, and therefore get on the way to you again, so far as this will take me.|$|E

50|$|The {{largest and}} most {{conspicuous}} volcanoes on Mars occur in Tharsis and Elysium regions. These volcanoes are strikingly similar to shield volcanoes on Earth. Both have shallow-sloping flanks and summit calderas. The main difference between Martian shield volcanoes and those on Earth is in size: Martian shield volcanoes are truly colossal. For example, the tallest volcano on Mars, Olympus Mons, is 550 km across and 21 km high. It is nearly 100 times greater in volume than Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the largest shield volcano on Earth. Geologists <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that volcanoes on Mars are able to grow so large is because Mars lacks plate tectonics. The Martian lithosphere does not slide over the upper mantle (asthenosphere) as on Earth, so lava from a stationary hot spot is able to accumulate at one location on the surface for a billion years or longer.|$|E

5000|$|... “This is one {{relationship}} that's as refreshingly honest as {{they come}} with characters as real and sweet as their portrayers." [...] — Soap Opera Magazine in 1998, on the popularity of Lucky and Liz. Lucky and Elizabeth first made a supercouple name for themselves during the storyline of Elizabeth's rape in 1998. The young couple was compared to the romance of Lucky's parents Luke and Laura, notorious supercouple of the 1980s. As a result, they are commonly referred to by the portmanteau [...] "L&L" [...] or [...] "L&L2" [...] on internet message boards. Similar to the nuances of other supercouples, Lucky always calls Liz by a certain name, a popular detail to fans. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Magazine {{that it was his}} idea: [...] "I just made a decision that I wanted to call her Elizabeth. I don't know why. I really like the name. I think it's beautiful - and I also think she has a different relationship with him. Everyone else may call her Liz, but to him she's Elizabeth." [...] As the on-screen couple took the start of their relationship slow, their popularity with fans grew quickly. The gradual timing of the relationship was one reason for the popularity, as viewers watched them blossom from friends to something more. The slow progression made viewers feel the relationship was honest and innocent, something unique among soap opera couples at the time. Jackson described in a 1999 interview, “What's been portrayed is what people want to see. A kind of pure romance and pure love." [...] Herbst commented to Soap Opera Digest in 1998: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why people like them so much is because their relationship is so healthy. (...) Individually they have their own issues and problems that they need to work out. But I think people like seeing that - they like seeing them work out their problems together." [...] Elizabeth and Lucky first grow close as friends, while Lucky helps Liz deal with her rape and Liz helps Lucky deal with his family issues. Another factor in the couple's rise to supercouple status was the chemistry between original portrayers of the couple, Herbst and Jackson. Their chemistry grew as they bonded during Elizabeth's rape. Herbst explained in a 1998 interview:The slow progression of the couple's physical relationship was another reason for its success. Each character dealing with personal issues, the couple’s first kiss happened months into the relationship, and was much anticipated and celebrated by fans. The gradual pacing continued when the couple decided to wait to have sex, shortly before Lucky is presumed dead in April 1999 and off-screen for close to a year. Herbst and Jackson’s popularity continued after his departure; that July they were still voted number one actor, actress and couple by fans of Soaps In Depth.|$|E

40|$|The theme we {{have chosen}} for {{discussion}} in this paper {{is the theme of}} “play”. We feel that one of play {{is one of the most}} affordable ways of learning. Children often adopt this approach to learning. As we grow older we seem to disregard this method of learning. We wish to create a device that makes learning and exploration of that device fun. My new design motto is “to encourage play”. Words of wisdom “I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why games have led the way in interaction design in some respects is because the objective is to have fun. There’s not a productive outcome, so all the seriousness that we bring to work is not present in the design of these things. ” Brenda Laurel, 2001 “One of the first precepts of Electronic Arts, that interactive entertainment was going to be as big as traditional music and video entertainment, was driven by our belief that “play ” is a core human value; even a core mammalian value. We used an analogy that lion cubs learn to hunt and fight by playing together” Importance of play Bing Gordon, cofounder of Electronic Arts In experimental music in 1958 John Cage talks about the importance of play and describes play as “a way of waking up to the very life we’re living”. As we grow up the activity of play which as children allowed us to explore and understand the world can become lost [1]. With the greater availability of recorded music we are left with a more convenient but more passive way of enjoying music. Interfacing the key to play The mouse is capable of doing just a few things which leaves the user with few degrees of freedom; the commands are all done with too few physical gestures [2]. With a musical instrument the user has many more degrees of freedom. A violinist uses a broad range of physical gestures and choosing from a huge range of bowing pressures, pitch choices and so on. Making people play together, the phrase evokes visions of one of the highest forms of social expression [1]...|$|E
