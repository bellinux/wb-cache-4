40|$|The carcass {{and meat}} quality {{characteristics}} of three halothane genotypes in pigs were evaluated. Sixty crossbred Landrace×Large White pigs (NN= 25, Nn= 19, nn= 16) of ± 86 kg live weight were slaughtered, the carcasses chilled for 24 h at 2 °C, certain carcass and meat quality traits determined and {{the shoulder and}} leg cuts deboned and cut into primal cuts. Dressing percentage of the Nn pigs was higher (P< 0. 05) {{than that of the}} NN and nn pigs. Carcass length was the longest (P< 0. 05) for the nn pigs. Midline fat measurements as well as measurements at the 2 nd- 3 rd last rib (45 mm from the midline) indicated that the nn pigs had less fat (P< 0. 05) and a larger eye muscle width (P< 0. 05), depth (P< 0. 001) and area (P< 0. 001) than the NN or Nn pigs. This resulted in the nn pigs having the highest (P< 0. 05) percentage predicted carcass lean content. Fat, bone and lean yield of the shoulder identified the nn pigs with the least bone (P< 0. 05) and fat (P< 0. 001) and the highest lean yield (P< 0. 05), expressed as a percentage of total shoulder weight. Yield from the legs identified the nn pigs as having the lowest fat (P< 0. 001) and highest lean (P< 0. 05), expressed as a percentage of total leg weight. The primal lean cuts (topside, silverside, <b>thickflank</b> and rump) from the legs showed that the nn pigs had the highest values (P< 0. 05) for lean as a fraction of cold carcass weight. This resulted from the higher weight of these cuts (P< 0. 05) in the nn pigs. Calculation of bone yield in the legs showed that the femur weights were highest (P< 0. 05) for the Nn pigs, also when expressed as percentage of leg weight (P< 0. 05) and as a fraction of cold carcass weight (P< 0. 05). Comparison of meat quality traits show that the nn pigs had poor quality with regard to pH 45 (P< 0. 001), pH 24 (P< 0. 05), drip loss (P< 0. 001) and reflectance values (P< 0. 05) © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
