500|$|From {{the third}} season {{to the sixth}} season, the mysterious Syndicate was {{explored}} in detail. In the two part episode [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology {{in a new direction}} was originally conceived in September 1998. Director Kim Manners stated [...] "I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole story line of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore." ...|$|E

[...] The original script featured various flashback sequences to the actors Peter Donat, William B. Davis and Veronica Cartwright, all from scenes around twenty-to-thirty years earlier in the show. They did various makeup jobs on the actors to make them look younger. However, the writers eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} it [...] "just didn't [...] work", so they cut out most of that storyline, which ultimately led to the creation of a whole new direction in which the Cigarette Smoking Man provided a monologue explaining the history of the project instead. The first scene was shot in Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|The 350th {{anniversary of}} Monteverdi's death, celebrated in 1993, brought a further wave of {{interest}} in his works, and since that time performances of L'incoronazione have been given in opera houses and music festivals all over the world. In April 1994 the Juilliard School in New York presented a version based on Curtis's edition, with an orchestra that mixed baroque and modern elements. The New York Times's Allen Kozinn wrote that this production had done well to resolve daunting problems arising from Monteverdi's having left instrumentation and scoring details open, and from the numerous competing versions of the score. In 2000 the work was chosen by Opéra de Montréal as the company's first venture into baroque opera, with a performance directed by Renaud Doucet. Opera Canada reported that Doucet had found [...] "a perfect rhetoric for a modern crowd, creating an atmosphere of moral ambivalence that the courtiers of Monteverdi's day would have taken for granted." [...] Less successful, in the critics' eyes, was the innovative English National Opera (ENO) production directed by Chen Shi-Zheng in October 2007. According to The London Evening Standard critic Fiona Maddocks the cast was strong, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be playing in the wrong roles. For unexplained reasons much of the action took place underwater; at one point [...] "a snorkeller flip-flops across the stage in a harness." [...] Seneca [...] "wore green Wellington boots and pushed a lawnmower". At the end of 2007, in his opera review of the year, The Daily Telegraph's Rupert Christiansen compared ENO's production unfavourably with a punk musical version of the opera that had been staged during that year's Edinburgh Festival.|$|E

2500|$|Sharon {{wrote in}} his autobiography: [...] "We had become skilled at finding our way in the darkest nights and {{gradually}} we built up the strength and endurance these kind of operations required. Under the stress of constant combat we drew closer {{to one another and}} began to operate not just as a military unit but almost as a family. ... e were in combat almost every day. Ambushes and battles followed each other until <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> run together." ...|$|E
60|$|About noon <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> wake up {{from their}} {{lethargic}} state. Van der Kemp laid down his paddle, and, looking round, asked Nigel if he felt tired.|$|E
60|$|All of 'em {{hung back}} and looked at each other; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> think they'd 'ave a better chance when there wasn't so many numbers left in the bag.|$|E

6000|$|Dan felt a balm in this; he too {{had noticed}} a superfluity of ideals in Alice, he had borne {{the burden of}} {{realising}} some of them; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> relate in objectionable degree to his perfectionation. So he said gloomily, [...] "She was very good. And I was to blame." ...|$|E
60|$|If the Black Kendah saw him go, {{of which}} I am doubtful, for <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{be lost in}} {{consultation}} round their king and the dead general, Goru, they {{made no attempt to}} follow him. Another possibility is that they thought he was trying to lead them into some snare or ambush.|$|E
6000|$|To {{the eye of}} Bertram <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be lost in dreamy reverie, but Redhand observed, with {{a feeling}} of anxiety, that he who seemed to be their chief sat in that {{peculiar}} attitude which indicates intense attention.

6000|$|... "She {{is not the}} worst, {{though she}} {{sometimes}} is hard to bear. I can't {{tell you what it}} is, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> think so much of themselves. In the first place they never will say a word about papa." ...|$|R

60|$|At {{this point}} Mabel {{rose from the}} table, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> become aware of her existence. She began putting the dishes together. The young doctor looked at her, but did not address her. He had not greeted her. She {{went out of the}} room with the tray, her face impassive and unchanged.|$|E
60|$|Just {{before we}} reached the {{confines}} of the town, a pretty young girl, with some lovely lilies in her hand, ran forward and presented them to Good--somehow <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> like Good; I think his eye-glass and solitary whisker gave him a fictitious value--and then said that she had a boon to ask.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} we {{must have}} come upon the Selenites. There were six of them, and they were marching in single file over a rocky place, making the most remarkable piping and whining sounds. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> become aware of us at once, all instantly became silent and motionless, like animals, with their faces turned towards us.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went away}} {{then in a}} {{thoughtful}} mood. I said, {{this is a good}} pleasure excursion. I like it. The passengers are not garrulous, but still they are sociable.

40|$|Scholars and pundits alike {{have been}} {{qualifying}} our times as of “transition and turbulence”, “disorder” and “strategic unease”. Other concepts that recur in {{discussions on the}} present state of the world are ‘uncertainty’ and ‘unpredictability’. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> point to a world in flux. Let’s see what that means...|$|R
60|$|Lord Ballindine {{received}} them in {{the same}} costume, and very glad <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> see him again. When an Irish gentleman is popular in his neighbourhood, nothing can exceed the real devotion paid to him; and when that gentleman is a master of hounds, and does not require a subscription, he is more than ever so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, sir," [...] Mr. Richards said; [...] "there {{are three}} or four in my house, and there are ten at Mr. Sargent's, and two at Carr's, who have gone on the sick list. I sent for the doctor, {{and he may have}} seen them by this time; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have been knocked down and kicked." ...|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round on}} his friends {{with an air}} of {{combined}} solemnity and triumph. The solemnity without the triumph marked the faces of his friends as they returned the look in profound silence, for <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> feel that the prince {{was in a state of}} exaltation, and that something approaching to the nature of a prophecy had been uttered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not all of them, Gran'pa Jim, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} 'passed by the Board of Censors'--perhaps when {{their eyes were}} shut. I love the good pictures, and I know that you do, but some we have seen lately gave me the shivers. So, perhaps Miss Stearne is right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you'd better tell him, then, in {{your own}} popular way, which <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} so well," [...] responded the daughter. Mr. Wynn cast {{a quick glance at}} her, but there was no trace of irony in her face--nothing but a half-bored indifference as she walked toward the window.|$|R
50|$|Themes recur {{throughout}} the work, {{and although it}} is 13 separate songs, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> flow together. The cover artwork for this album was by Margie Schnibbe, another childhood friend of Phideaux Xavier's, who painted a 20-page booklet {{that was quite a}} departure from the Gothic imagery of the first three albums.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard {{something}} {{of this as}} I came up the lakes," [...] rejoined Ben; [...] "and fell in with a trader, an old acquaintance, from Canada, and a good friend, too, though he is to be my enemy, according to law, who gave me {{to understand that the}} summer would not go over without blows. Still, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be asleep at Mackinaw (Michilimackinac) as I passed there." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{girls were}} so ridiculously dressed, too, {{that they were}} in rags before supper. How could the boys help {{treading}} on their trains? And yet when their trains were trodden on, they often showed temper again, and looked as black, they did! However, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be pleased when Mrs. Alicumpaine said, 'Supper is ready, children!' And they went crowding and pushing in, as if they had had dry bread for dinner.|$|E
60|$|Both the shaggy man and Dorothy looked {{grave and}} anxious, {{for they were}} sorrowful that such a misfortune had {{overtaken}} their little companion. Toto barked at the fox-boy once or twice, not realizing it was his former friend who now wore the animal head; but Dorothy cuffed the dog and made him stop. As for the foxes, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> think Button-Bright's new head very becoming and that their King had conferred a great honor on this little stranger.|$|E
50|$|While many {{of these}} sacred lines extend as far as ten or twenty {{kilometers}} (and perhaps further), <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> maintain a remarkable straightness despite rugged topography and natural obstacles. The sheer number and length of these lines {{is often difficult to}} perceive from ground level, but from the air or hilltop vantage points, they are stunning.|$|R
50|$|Feeding {{habits of}} the {{caterpillar}} larvae are not well known; while <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> feed on eudicots, there is no obvious preference for a particular lineage of these. Most Tineodidae larvae <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be leaf miners as in closely related moth families. Those of Cenoloba obliteralis (and perhaps others) inhabit developing fruiit instead, where they eat the young seeds.|$|R
