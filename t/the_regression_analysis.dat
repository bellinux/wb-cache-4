In particular, a fuzzy clusterwise linear regression model (FCWLR model) with symmetrical fuzzy output and crisp input variables for performing fuzzy cluster analysis within a fuzzy linear regression framework is suggested. For measuring the goodness of fit of the suggested FCWLR model with fuzzy output, a fitting index is proposed. In order to illustrate the usefulness of FCWLR model in practice, several applications to artificial and real datasets are shown. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The goodness of fit, which represents the minimal difference between experimental and modeled data in a particular measure, does not reveal how reliable the parameter estimates are {{and it is not}} the sufficient criteria to prove the model was chosen correctly either. For example, if the experimental data was noisy or just insufficient amount of data points was processed, substitution of best fitted parameter values by orders of magnitude will not significantly influence the quality of fit. To address this issues the identifiability analysis could be applied as an important step to ensure correct choice of model, and sufficient amount of experimental data. The purpose of this analysis is either a quantified proof of correct model choice and integrality of experimental data acquired or such analysis can serve as an instrument for the detection of non-identifiable and sloppy parameters, helping planning the experiments and in building and improvement of the model at the early stages.|$|E
5000|$|Yule (1936) and Granger and Newbold (1974) {{were the}} first to draw {{attention}} to the problem of spurious correlation and find solutions on how to address it in time series analysis. Given two completely unrelated but integrated (non-stationary) time series, <b>the</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analysis</b> of one on the other will tend to produce an apparently statistically significant relationship and thus a researcher might falsely believe to have found evidence of a true relationship between these variables. Ordinary least squares will no longer be consistent and commonly used test-statistics will be non-valid. In particular, Monte Carlo simulations show that one will get a very high R squared, very high individual t-statistic and a low Durbin-Watson statistic. Technically speaking, Phillips (1986) proved that parameter estimates will not converge in probability, the intercept will diverge and the slope will have a non-degenerate distribution as the sample size increases. However, there might a common stochastic trend to both series that a researcher is genuinely interested in because it reflects a long-run relationship between these variables. Because of the stochastic nature of the trend it is not possible to break up integrated series into a deterministic (predictable) trend and a stationary series containing deviations from trend. Even in deterministically detrended random walks walks spurious correlations will eventually emerge. Thus detrending doesn't solve the estimation problem. In order to still use the [...] Box-Jenkins approach, one could difference the series and then estimate models such as ARIMA, given that many commonly used time series (e.g. in economics) appear to be stationary in first differences. Forecasts from such a model will still reflect cycles and seasonality that are present in the data. However, any information about long-run adjustments that the data in levels may contain is omitted and longer term forecasts will be unreliable. This lead Sargan (1964) to develop the ECM methodology, which retains the level information.|$|E
