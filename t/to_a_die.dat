Foster left school at the age of ten to {{apprentice}} himself <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> sinker. Foster left that position three years later to work in a white lead factory. Over the next ten years he worked in fertilizer plants in Reading, Pennsylvania and Jacksonville, Florida, as a railroad construction worker and sawmill employee in Florida, as a streetcar motorman in New York City, as a lumber camp and longshoreman in Portland, Oregon and as a sailor. Foster even homesteaded for a year in Oregon in 1905, although he also worked a series of odd jobs as a miner, sheepherder, sawmill worker and railroad employee during that year before abandoning the farm.|$|E
500|$|Another of Gestumblindi's riddles asks, [...] "What is that beast all girded with iron, which {{kills the}} flocks? [...] He has eight horns but no head, and runs as he pleases." [...] Here, {{it is the}} answer that is controversial, as the {{response}} has been variously translated as: [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has {{the name of a}} bear and runs when he is thrown;" [...] or, [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] The first problem is in translating the word húnn, which may refer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> (as suggested by the former translation), the [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight corners of a six-sided die and [...] "the flocks" [...] that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose. [...] Alternatively, húnn may refer to the king, his [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight defenders, which is more consistent with the latter translation, [...] "He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] Ultimately, the literary references prove inconclusive on the use of dice in Hnefatafl.|$|E

2500|$|During the [...] {{annealing}} process of die making, two main errors can occur, resulting {{in less than}} perfect dies. It is impossible to tell without expensive and lengthy tests whether these errors occurred, but they will lead to significantly weaker dies and a higher tendency to deteriorate quickly. The first thing which can happen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> in this process what metallurgists call decarburization. Decarburization {{is the result of}} an improper mix of metals and chemicals in the annealing furnace where the dies are sent to soften. If there is not enough ambient carbon in the furnace, the steel will give up some of its carbon and will become soft. The result is a thin surface of inadequate metal whose chemical composition has been altered and is below standard.|$|E

50|$|All {{rolls in}} the game are done by using 12-sided dice, and adding or {{subtracting}} a modifier (adding being far more common). Human-level abilities and skills add 1 to 4 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> roll result, while superhuman abilities can add anything from 5 up, with modifiers adding more than 12 through a single ability being somewhat rare, but not unheard of for superheroes. To use an ability against a foe or other opposing force, you have to simply meet or beat the other side's total result. Rolls are usually opposed (both sides roll).|$|E
5000|$|Coining is a {{cold working}} process similar in other respects to forging, which takes place at {{elevated}} temperature; it uses {{a great deal of}} force to plastically deform a workpiece, so it conforms <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>die.</b> Coining can be done using a gear driven press, a mechanical press, or more commonly, a hydraulically actuated press. Coining typically requires higher tonnage presses than stamping, because the workpiece is plastically deformed and not actually cut, as in some other forms of stamping. The coining process is preferred when there is a high tonnage.|$|E
50|$|This chart is {{the games}} system for {{overcoming}} {{one of the}} perceived flaws in a linearly progressive skill based game system. In a standard system, any modifier <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> roll has a greater effect on a lower skill level than a higher one. For example, a -1 modifier to a skill of 15 reduces that skill by about 7%, where a skill of 5 is reduced by 20%. To overcome this, any roll to dertermine the success of an action would first have the modifiers referenced on the Universal Modifier Chart, which would alter the penalty (or bonus) to the skill accordingly.|$|E
