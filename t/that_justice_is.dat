25|$|Conscious of the {{negative}} consequences of the real likelihood test on the judge in question and the administration of justice referred to in the previous paragraph, the court may lose sight of the rationale behind the apparent bias doctrine – <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> not merely done but that the public must see without doubt that it is done.|$|E
25|$|Also, an {{extremely}} independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, {{which is the}} duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> upheld.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} Rank Organisation {{in the early}} 1960s, Bogarde {{abandoned}} his heart-throb image for more challenging parts. He starred in the film Victim (1961), playing a London barrister who fights the blackmailers {{of a young man}} with whom he has had a deeply emotional relationship. The young man commits suicide after being arrested for embezzlement, rather than ruin his beloved's career. In exposing the ring of extortionists, Bogarde's character risks his reputation and marriage in order to see <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> done. Victim was the first British film to portray the humiliation gay people were exposed to via discriminatory law, and as a victimized minority; it is said to have had some effect upon the later Sexual Offences Act 1967 ending the illegal status of homosexual activity.|$|E

[...] "To {{say there was}} an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place," [...] the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as [...] "a white black man" [...] and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had [...] "abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular". Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he [...] "may not be welcomed anywhere by people who believe <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> bigger than even sport". Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had [...] "never been bothered about criticism, and I do not see why I should start now". Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' [...] "calm dignity {{in response to the}} primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{model of}} {{organizational}} justice proposed by Byrne (1999) and colleagues (Byrne & Cropanzano, 2000) [...] suggested that organizational justice is a multi-foci construct, one where employees see justice as {{coming from a}} source - either the organization or their supervisor. Thus, rather than focus on justice as {{the three or four}} factor component model, Byrne suggested that employees personify the organization and they distinguish between whether they feel the organization or supervisor have treated them fairly (interactional), use fair procedures (procedural), or allocate rewards or assignments fairly (distributive justice). A number of researchers used this model exploring the possibility <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> more than just 3 or 4 factors (e.g., Karriker & Williams, 2009).|$|E
2500|$|In such cases, {{there are}} strong policy {{considerations}} supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair {{if a person is}} kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts {{to be sure that the}} disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, [...] "if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> done rather than being asked to take it on trust".|$|E

2500|$|Parkes {{wrote that}} the genre of the {{anthology}} is an appropriate one in which to write about Nietzsche, claiming that he is [...] "above all a writer in many voices, and one problem with books written about his work {{is that they have}} been mainly 'monological,' with the author speaking in only one voice." [...] He argues <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> more likely to be done to Nietzsche's work when a multiplicity of perspectives is possible, and that Nietzsche and Asian Thought takes this idea further, with the inclusion of thinkers from East Asia as well as Europe. However, the work does not seek to recast Nietzsche as some kind of multicultural thinker, but instead serves to [...] "complicate" [...] our understanding of Nietzsche. One [...] "significant absence" [...] from the work is the work of Nishitani Keiji, a Japanese philosopher who lists Nietzsche as a major influence. Originally, Nietzsche and Asian Thought had been intended to contain a translation of an essay by Nishitani, first published in the 1930s, comparing Nietzsche's Zarathustra to Meister Eckhart, but considerations of time and space prevented this.|$|E
2500|$|In {{coming to}} his {{decision}} in the present case, Menon highlighted the principle upon which apparent bias stands {{as a ground for}} judicial review, separate from that of actual bias. Since justice is rooted in public confidence, it is imperative that [...] "right-minded people" [...] not hold the impression that [...] "the judge was biased". The appearance of impartiality is as important as actual impartiality, because there is public interest in ensuring <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> seen to be done. The reasonable suspicion test upholds this principle as it [...] "safeguards not only the fact but also the appearance of justice being done". Thus he held this to be the more appropriate test because the inquiry is focused on whether a reasonable member of the public would have the impression that the public authority acted with bias, regardless of whether the court thought it likely or possible. On the other hand, the adoption of the real likelihood test would shift the focus of the inquiry {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person to that of a judge who is no longer concerned strictly with the appearance of bias but rather with establishing whether there is in fact a sufficient possibility of bias.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that {{the differences between the two}} tests are largely semantic and that the two tests operate similarly. In Locabail, the judges stated that in a large proportion of the cases, application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome. It was also held that [...] "rovided that the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes an approach which is based on broad common sense, and without inappropriate reliance on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed members of the public, there should be no risk that the courts will not ensure both <b>that</b> <b>justice</b> <b>is</b> done and that it is perceived by the public to be done". In the Singapore High Court decision Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2005), Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang observed that the real likelihood test is in reality similar to that of reasonable suspicion. First, likelihood is in fact [...] "possibility", as opposed to the higher standard of proof centring on [...] "probability". Secondly, he suggested that real in real likelihood cannot be taken to mean [...] "actual", as this test relates to apparent and not actual bias. He also observed that both the court's and the public's perspectives are [...] "integral parts of a holistic process" [...] with no need to draw a sharp distinction between them.|$|E
