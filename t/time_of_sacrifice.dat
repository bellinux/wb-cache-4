40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether a remote, miniaturized pressure sensor could maintain calibration and function through organized thrombus {{over an extended}} period in a porcine model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). METHODS: Six adult pigs had an AAA surgically created and excluded. A sensor zeroed to atmospheric pressure was placed within the aneurysm sac and another within the suprarenal aorta of each animal. Pressure measurements were taken at the initial operation and then on a weekly basis over 2 months. The aortic sensors were correlated to an intra-arterial pressure catheter at the initial operation and at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> Back-table sensor correlation with atmospheric pressure was done at the time of explantation. RESULTS: Three animals died during the follow-up period. Five animals were available for 6 -week follow-up, of which 3 survived for the complete 8 -week protocol. Two of the surviving animals had an intra-aortic sensor. All 5 aneurysm sac sensors functioned throughout the experimental period. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice,</b> the sacs contained a large amount of organized thrombus in which the sac sensors were deeply embedded. The 3 aortic sensors also functioned throughout the course of the experiments. The pressures correlated within 5 mmHg to the catheter-based measurements taken at the initial operation and at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> Comparison to atmospheric pressure revealed no calibration offset in any sensor. CONCLUSIONS: This chronic implantation study demonstrates the durability of a remote, miniaturized pressure sensor within a surgically created aneurysm sac as well as the suprarenal aorta of a porcine AAA model. There was no calibration offset in any of the sensors, and they remained valid at explantation. We believe that this is further evidence of the potential applicability of this sensor for clinical use...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} better, noninvasive {{quantitative}} biomarkers for assessing the rate of progression and possible response to therapy in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In this study, we compared three electrophysiological measures: compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, motor unit number estimate (MUNE), and electrical impedance myography (EIM) 50 kHz phase values in a mild mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy, the Smn 1 c/c mouse. Smn 1 c/c mice (N =  11) and wild type (WT) animals (-/-, N =  13) were measured on average triweekly until approximately 1 year of age. Measurements included CMAP, EIM, and MUNE of the gastrocnemius muscle as well as weight and front paw grip strength. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice</b> at one year, additional analyses were performed on the animals including serum survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels and muscle fiber size. Both EIM 50 kHz phase and CMAP showed strong differences between WT and SMA animals (repeated measures 2 -way ANOVA, P< 0. 0001 for both) whereas MUNE did not. Both body weight and EIM showed differences in the trajectory over time (p< 0. 001 and p =  0. 005, respectively). At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice</b> at one year, EIM values correlated to motor neuron counts in the spinal cord and SMN levels across both groups of animals (r =  0. 41, p =  0. 047 and r =  0. 57, p  =  0. 003, respectively), while CMAP did not. Motor neuron number in Smn 1 c/c mice was not significantly reduced compared to WT animals. EIM appears sensitive to muscle status in this mild animal model of SMA. The lack of a reduction in MUNE or motor neuron number but reduced EIM and CMAP values support that much of the pathology in these animals is distal to the cell body, likely at the neuromuscular junction or the muscle itself...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{anti-inflammatory}} potential of adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of Tregitope 167 in an experimental colitis model. METHODS: The trinitrobenzene sulfonate (TNBS) model of induced colitis {{was used in}} Balb/c mice. Subsequently after intravenous adeno-associated virus-mediated regulatory T-cell epitopes (Tregitope) delivery, acute colitis was initiated by intra-rectal administration of 1. 5 mg TNBS in 40 % ethanol followed by a second treatment with TNBS (0. 75 mg in 20 % ethanol) 8 d later. Control groups included mice not treated with TNBS (healthy control group) and mice treated by TNBS only (diseased group). At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice</b> colon weight, the disease activity index and histology damage score were determined. Immunohistochemical staining of the colonic tissues was performed to asses the cellular infiltrate {{and the presence of}} transcription factor forkhead Box-P 3 (Foxp 3). Thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen tissue were collected and the corresponding lymphocyte populations were further assessed by flow cytometry analysis for the expression of CD 4 + T cell and regulatory T cell associated markers. RESULTS: The Tregitope 167 treated mice gained an average of 4 % over their initial body weight at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice.</b> In contrast, the mice treated with TNBS alone (no Tregitope) developed colitis, and lost 4 % of their initial body weight at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>sacrifice</b> (P < 0. 01). The body weight increase that had been observed in the mice pre-treated with Tregitope 167 was substantiated by a lower disease activity index and a decreased colon weight as compared to the diseased control group (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001, respectively). Immunohistochemical staining of the colonic tissues for CD 4 + showed that inflammatory cell infiltrates were present in TNBS treated mice with or without administration with tregitope 167 and that these cellular infiltrates consisted mainly of CD 4 + cells. For both TNBS treated groups CD 4 + T cell infiltrates were observed in the sub-epithelial layer and the lamina propria. CD 4 + T cell infiltrates were also present in the muscularis mucosa layer of the diseased control mice, but were absent in the Tregitope 167 treated group. Numerous Foxp 3 positive cells were detected in the lamina propria and sub-epithelium of the colon sections from mice treated with Tregitope 167. Furthermore, the Foxp 3 and glycoprotein A repetitions predominant markers were significantly increased in the CD 4 + T lymphocyte population in the thymus of the mice pre-treated with adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (cytomegalovirus promoter-Tregitope 167), as cytomegalovirus promoter compared to lymphocyte populations in the thymus of diseased and the healthy control mice (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 001, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study identifies adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of regulatory T-cell epitope 167 as a novel anti-inflammatory approach with the capacity to decrease intestinal inflammation and induce long-term remission in inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E
