40|$|AbstractBackgroundMagnesium level {{alteration}} {{may cause}} coagulation abnormality resulting in bleeding complication after off-pump {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting. In this study, we investigated the effect of magnesium on the postoperative coagulation profile and bleeding in OPCAB patients. MethodsIn a double blind clinical trial, six hundred patients were randomly allocated to two groups: group A (n= 150) and group B (n= 450). Group A received 50 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate (MS) in 100 ml 0. 9 % NaCl solution over 20 min before the anesthesia induction. Group B or control group received only 100 ml 0. 9 % NaCl solution {{at the same time}} points. OPCAB was performed with standard technique and device. Blood samples were collected 30 min before and 6 h after the surgery to analyze hemoglobin and blood coagulation tests. Postoperative exploration for bleeding, blood transfusion, and volume of transfusion was recorded. The two groups compared with t-test and χ 2 tests and p-valve < 0. 05 were considered as significant. ResultsHowever, postoperative hemoglobin was statistically lower in group A compared with group B, but platelet, PT, and aPTT tests were not statistically different between two groups. The serum MS level, exploration for bleeding, volume of packed cell transfusion, and volume of postoperative bleeding were statistically different between group A vs group B. ConclusionPreoperative MS use may be associated with the postoperative platelet dysfunction and increased <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>bleeding.</b> This is an important risk factor for postoperative bleeding in the OPCAB in absence of CPB use...|$|E
40|$|Pre-, per-, and {{post-operative}} anticoagulation at {{the therapeutic}} level is nowadays the most, {{if not the}} only, available effective method to prevent post-operative thrombo-embolism. There is no increased <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>bleeding</b> to be feared during the operation. The real danger of this prophylaxis consists of a treacherous tendency to acute relative overdosage after the operation. This is explained by the combined indirect action of anticoagulants and influences related to the operation. As its development can accurately be followed by laboratory tests, dangerous levels of anticoagulation can be prevented. Experiences in 242 surgical patients are presented to demon-strate {{the efficacy of the}} following post-operative routine: Coagulation studies (prothrombin time or thrombotest) at least twice daily during one week; fractionated administration of anti-coagulants and, if necessary, small amounts (0 - 25 - 1 mg.) of vitamin K 1. The results suggest that with this policy the risk of thrombo-embolism in surgery can be considerably reduced, if not abolished. Anticoagulation at the time of surgery is desirable for several reasons. First, treatment of thrombosis, even if it is started at the first or even doubtful manifestation of the post-operative complication, does not sig-nificantly reduce the frequency of lethal pulmon-ary embolism. The mortality of thrombosis still amounts to one in every few hundred operations and continues to cast a shadow over modern surgery, including minor operations in young adults. Embolectomy, even with the stand-by of extracorporeal circulation, does not save more than a fraction of the many who die annually from post-operative pulmonary embolism (Cooley...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} PUW (a fraction containing 60 % corilagin from a Chinese herbal plant Phyllanthus urinaria) on thrombosis and coagulation system. Methods: Myers's method {{was used to evaluate}} the protection of intravenously administered PUW against the male mouse sudden death caused by injection of 75 mg/kg arachidonic acid in the tail vein; Charlton's method was modified to observe antithrombotic effect of PUW in rat electrically stimulated carotid artery thrombosis model; and the model of venous thrombosis was produced to {{investigate the}} antithrombotic effect of PUW. Rosette assay was used to observe the effect of PUW on platelet-neutrophil adhesion. The effects of PUW were monitored on euglobulin lysis time (ELT), prothrombin time (PT), kaolin partial thromboplastin time (KPTT), and bleeding time (BT) in rats, according to the methods of Kowalski, HUANG Zheng-Liang, and GU Yue-Fang, et al, respectively. Results: The results showed that PUW administered intravenously significantly decreased the mouse mortality, prolonged the occlusion time of rat carotid arteries, and reduced the wet and dry thrombus weight of the inferior vena cava, respectively. PUW markedly inhibited the binding of activated platelets to neutrophils, obtaining 39. 7 mg/L of the medium inhibitory concentration. Intravenously administered PUW significantly shortened ELT, prolonged KPTT while had no influence on PT; PUW increased BT in rat tail tips but the BT caused by PUW was much shorter than that by aspirin or urokinase. Conclusion: It is suggested that PUW has the potential of antithrombosis due to its inhibition of platelet-neutrophil adhesion.

40|$|Coagulopathy in {{cirrhosis}} is {{a composite}} condition where liver synthetic deficit rebalances coagulation to a parallel reduction of both pro- and anticoagulant factors. Cirrhosis is therefore no longer considered a hypocoagulable state but rather a more unstable hemostatic balance with a lower threshold for tipping toward thrombosis or bleeding. <b>Tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>bleeding</b> in cirrhosis {{is due to the}} reduction in the synthesis of procoagulants and a low platelet count as well as hyperfibrinolysis. Variceal hemorrhage is a frequent bleeding complication in decompensated cirrhosis. However, the possible contribution of coagulopathy as a precipitant or an aggravating factor is poorly documented and further data are required to clarify its real contributing role. Moreover, apart from the gastrointestinal tract, the occurrence of spontaneous and procedure-related bleeding elsewhere in the body, whilst not uncommon, is less than would be expected. By contrast, a large-scale population-based study has shown the propensity towards venous thrombosis in patients with liver diseases. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a critical but frequent event occurring in up to 40 % of patients with liver cirrhosis. PVT causes deterioration of the clinical course, the complications of portal hypertension and an increase in post-transplant mortality. The pathogenesis of PVT includes both local alterations, like blood flow reduction and endothelial activation, and systemic derangement. Systemic prohemostatic alterations include high von Willebrand factor, low ADAMTS- 13, low levels of anticoagulants (antithrombin, proteins C and S) and increases in procoagulants like factor VIII. Low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin has proven to be safe and effective in both the treatment and prevention of PVT. In addition, patients in prophylaxis with enoxaparin showed a lower rate of decompensation and a better survival without bleeding complications. In such patients, circulating bacterial DNA, endotoxemia and markers of inflammation were attenuated compared to controls. These results therefore suggest a possible connection between enoxaparin, decrease of endotoxemia and reduction of portal hypertension. The approach to the coagulopathy in patients with liver diseases is changing: while the main goal for clinicians so far has been {{to reduce the risk of}} bleeding, the results of these new studies highlight the importance of preventing or treating thrombophilic disorders like PVT to avoid microcirculatory damage and eventually liver decompensation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{following}} {{pilot study}} tests {{the hypothesis that}} children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) present poor oral health compared to control subjects. To date, few analyses exist regarding a possible relationship between JIA and periodontitis. Methods: The study included 33 JIA patients and 28 control subjects between the age of 12 and 17. Detailed dental examinations and laboratory analyses were performed to assess periodontal (clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing) and oral hygiene status (plaque and gingival index). Antibodies for various periodontal pathogenic bacteria were analyzed using ELISA. The caries risk was measured {{by means of the}} DMFS- and DMFT-Index, the count of caries bacteria (mutans streptococci and lactoba-cilli), the salivary flow rate and buffer capacity. Furthermore, mouth opening and potential temporomandibular joint symptoms were characterized using the CMD report according to Ahlers and Jakstat. Nutritional status was assessed using a coded ques-tionnaire from the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE). Additionally, the duration of the disease, medication history and various blood parameters (erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate, CRP, ANA, HLA-B- 27) were determined in the JIA patients. Results: The results show that the risk of JIA patients to develop periodontitis is 3. 9 times higher compared to the control group (95 % confidence interval 1. 1 - 13. 9). Clinical attachment loss (p= 0. 046), the gingival index (p= 0. 003) and the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>bleeding</b> on probing (p= 0. 013) were significantly higher in JIA patients compared to controls. JIA patients had higher values of IgA (p= 0. 001) and IgG antibodies (p= 0. 002) as well as against Prevotella intermedia (p= 0. 001) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (p= 0. 003). There {{was no significant difference in}} the risk of caries and nutritional status between JIA patients and control subjects. Salivary flow rate (p= 0. 025) and buffer capacity (p= 0. 013) where significantly lower with JIA patients. JIA patients showed increased symptoms of temporomandibular dysfunction (p= 0. 001). The influence of disease onset, medication and blood parameters on the prevalence of periodontitis in JIA patients was not signifi-cant. Conclusion: A positive association was found between JIA and periodontitis; however, this relationship was not influenced by oral hygiene. Periodontal pathogenic bacteria, which are presumably involved in the development of periodontitis, were increased in IX JIA patients. Thus, immunoregulatory mechanisms may be responsible for the devel-opment of periodontitis. A close collaboration between rheumatologists and dentists is necessary for the early detection and treatment of inflammatory diseases of the mouth such as periodontitis. To confirm the results of this pilot study, further studies with a larger number of patients should be considered and particular focus given to specific periodontal pathogenic bacteria and their effect on immunoregulatory mechanisms...|$|E

To establish a possible association between familial dysfibrinogenemia and thrombophilia, data on cases with both affections were collected in a study {{within the framework of the}} SSC Subcommittee on Fibrinogen of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Registry forms of 51 cases were received. Twenty-six cases fulfilled the (arbitrarily chosen) criteria of familial dysfibrinogenemia and of thrombosis not due to other causes. Protein C and protein S deficiency and APC resistance as a cause of thrombosis could not be excluded in probands on anticoagulants or investigated before the discovery of the assays. The prevalence of dysfibrinogenemia in patients with a history of venous thrombosis is low, i. e. 0. 8 %, as deduced from 9 studies in 7 countries on 2376 patients. The 26 cases fulfilling the criteria are characterized by predominantly venous thrombosis at a young age. Severe bleeding was rare and limited to bleeding post partum. Homozygosity was established in 2 cases (Marburg and Naples), hypodysfibrinogenemia (less than 1. 5 mg antigen per ml) in 5 cases. A high incidence of problems related to pregnancy, in particular thrombosis post partum and spontaneous abortions was noted amongst the 15 women with thrombophilic dysfibrinogen. An association between dysfibrinogenemia and thrombophilia is indicated by studies on relatives of the 26 probands. Analysis of 187 investigated family members showed that thrombophilia affected 20 persons exclusively in the group of 99 relatives with dysfibrinogenemia, no thrombosis was reported in the group of 88 relatives without the defect. Convincing evidence for such an association became apparent for only 5 individual propositi of whom 2 or more family members had both the defect and thrombotic episodes at a young age (Caracas V, Frankfurt IV/Vlissingen, Melun, Naples and Paris V, also named Dusart). Mainly two mechanisms to explain thrombosis as a consequence of malfunctioning fibrinogen have been suggested: a) A defective binding of thrombin to abnormal fibrin which leads to increased thrombin levels (Malmo, Naples, New York I, Pamplona II, Poitiers), b) A defective stimulatory function of abnormal fibrin in the t-PA mediated fibrinolysis (Argenteuil, Chapel Hill III, Date, New York I, Nijmegen, Pamplona II, Paris V). Defects at the molecular level, elucidated in 15 out of the 26 cases fulfilling the criteria, were localised in the C-terminal part of the γ-chain (8 cases), in the N-terminal part of the Bβ-chain (3 cases) and in the Aα-chain (4 cases) of fibrinogen.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients with similarly low platelet counts {{differ in their}} <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>bleed.</b> <b>To</b> determine if differences in platelet function in ITP patients account for this variation in bleeding tendency, we conducted a single-center, cross-sectional study of pediatric patients with ITP. Bleeding severity (assessed by standardized bleeding score) and platelet function (assessed by whole blood flow cytometry) with and without agonist stimulationwas evaluated in 57 ITPpatients (medianage, 9. 9 years). After adjustment for platelet count, higher levels of thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) -stimulated percent P-selectin- and activated glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa–positive plateletswere significantly associatedwith a lower bleeding score,whereas higher levels of immatureplatelet fraction (IPF), TRAP-stimulatedplatelet surfaceCD 42 b,unstimulated platelet surface P-selectin, and platelet forward light scatter (FSC) were associated with a higher bleedingscore. Thus, platelet function tests related to platelet age (IPF, FSC) and activation through the protease activated receptor 1 (PAR 1) thrombin receptor (TRAP-stimulated P-selectin, activated GPIIb-IIIa, and CD 42 b), independent of platelet count, are associated with concurrent bleeding severity in ITP.
