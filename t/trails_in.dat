5|$|Another group, with no {{affiliation}} {{but with}} the same name, {{was created in the}} early 1970s to promote the maintenance of recreational <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the Ozarks.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 207 {{are located}} in the southeastern part of the Solomon Creek Watershed. They take up 6.7% of the watershed. Parts of Pinchot State Forest are also in the watershed; the forest {{occupies}} 12.6% of it. Two of the <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the 139-acre Sugar Notch Trail System {{are located in}} the sub-watershed of Sugar Notch Run. The creek is stocked with trout in some places. There are ATV <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the watershed.|$|E
50|$|Several {{portions}} of the old Wabash Railroad right of way have been converted to recreational use, including the Wabash Cannonball <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> northwest Ohio, the Wabash Heritage <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Indiana, the Wabash <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Illinois, and the Wabash Trace Nature <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Iowa.|$|R

50|$|In {{the north}} is the Maribyrnong River Trail {{as well as the}} Footscray Road Path which connects to the Capital City <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Docklands. Heading south the trail goes through Williamstown and intersects the lower Kororoit Creek <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Altona, then the Laverton Creek <b>Trail.</b> <b>In</b> the south the path terminates at the Skeleton Creek <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Altona Meadows.|$|R
5|$|Dogs are not {{permitted}} on any <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the park due {{to the presence of}} bears and other large mammals. Dogs are permitted at front country campsites that can be accessed by a vehicle and along paved roads.|$|E

Two campgrounds are {{on the banks of}} the lake: Doe Point and the Fish Lake Resort. Several <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the area lead to the much larger Pacific Crest Trail. Two snowparks are on Oregon Route 140.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} on average {{an hour and}} 24 minutes from Port Jervis, and 1 hours and 3 minutes from New York City. The Sloatsburg station, along with other nearby {{stations}} (Tuxedo, Harriman, or Suffern) on the Port Jervis lines also serve numerous hiking <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} major Native American <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the Nescopeck Creek watershed. These were the Lehigh Path, {{which is also}} known as the Warrior Trail, and the Trade Trail. Parts of these trails would become Vine Street and Broad Street in Hazleton, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Yarra River <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> the west. Intersects the Bushy Creek <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> the middle. Since the {{completion}} of the EastLink project (2008), the trail links to the Mullum Mullum Creek <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> the east, just 80 m west of Beckett Rd.|$|R

50|$|The Elroy-Sparta bike trail {{connects to}} the 400 <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Elroy and the La Crosse River <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Sparta.|$|R
5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|Detectives traced three {{distinct}} polonium <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> {{and out of}} London, at three different dates, which according to the investigation suggests Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun made two failed attempts to administer polonium to Litvinenko before the final and successful one. The first attempt took place on 16 October 2006, when radioactive traces were found in all places visited by the FSB operatives before and after their meeting with Litvinenko. They administered the poison to his tea, {{but he did not}} drink it.|$|E
5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light <b>trails)</b> <b>in</b> Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light <b>trails)</b> <b>in</b> Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E
50|$|Trails {{that lead}} along higher-drier park areas include: the Ridge <b>Trail</b> (<b>in</b> oak woodlands) and Anderson Flats <b>Trail</b> (<b>in</b> grasslands).|$|R
50|$|The Blind Creek <b>Trail,</b> <b>in</b> {{the outer}} eastern suburbs of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria, is a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians, which follows the Blind Creek from the Dandenong Creek <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Wantirna South to the Ringwood - Belgrave Rail <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> Boronia.|$|R
50|$|The {{first person}} to ever achieve The Triple Crown of Hiking was Eric Ryback. Ryback {{completed}} the Appalachian <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 1969 as a 16-year-old. He completed the Pacific Crest <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 1970 and chronicled it in his 1971 book The High Adventure of Eric Ryback: Canada to Mexico on Foot. Ryback completed the Continental Divide <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 1972 and chronicled it in his second book, The Ultimate Journey (now out of print). Reed Gjonnes, age 13, is the first child and youngest person to have thru-hiked all three trails to complete the Triple Crown. She hiked all three trails as continuous northbound hikes in one hiking season each. Along with her father Eric Gjonnes, she hiked the Pacific Crest <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 2011, the Appalachian <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 2012, and the Continental Divide <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 2013.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} constructing a greenway and connecting trail along Roaring Brook. Planned <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the greenway include the North Pocono rail trail and {{a link to}} the Nay Aug Park. The conservation plan recommended linking such a trail to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. A proposed pedestrian loop trail would have a footbridge over the stream.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{entertainment}} and recreation in urban areas, mostly in Amman, also attract tourists. Recently, the nightlife in Amman, Aqaba and Irbid {{has started to}} emerge {{and the number of}} bars, discos and nightclubs is on the rise. However, most nightclubs have a restriction on unescorted males. Alcohol is widely available in tourist restaurants, liquor stores and even some supermarkets. Valleys like Wadi Mujib and hiking <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> {{different parts of the country}} attract adventurers. Moreover, seaside recreation is present on the shores of Aqaba and the Dead Sea through several international resorts.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the {{watershed}} are biking and equestrian trails {{located in the}} lower portion of {{the watershed}}, in the immensely popular Aliso Canyon and its tributary, Wood Canyon. Aside from the main Aliso Creek Trail, the Wood Canyon Trail parallels a tributary of Aliso Creek (Wood Canyon Creek). There is also a bikeway along Sulphur Creek and along parts of English Canyon.|$|E
25|$|The long-abandoned Little Miami Railroad {{corridor}} {{was converted}} into a bike <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s and {{became part of the}} Little Miami Scenic <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 1984.|$|R
50|$|Round Mountain National Recreation Trail is a hiking <b>trail</b> <b>in</b> Roosevelt National Forest west of Loveland, Colorado. The {{trail was}} {{designated}} a National Recreation <b>Trail</b> <b>in</b> 1981.|$|R

Aiken Lava Bed from the lower end for 6 miles to the Round the Mountain Trail. The Cold Springs Trail #72 follows the western edge for 4 miles. Other <b>trails</b> <b>in</b> the area include the Gotchen Trail #40, Morrison Creek Trail #39, and Pineway Trail #71.|$|E
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow. This image, copied from the symbol used for waymarking the Ulster Way, has become the traditional waymarking symbol {{for all of the}} National Waymarked <b>Trails</b> <b>in</b> Ireland. Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E
