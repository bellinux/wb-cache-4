The current version of the sight is the PSO-1M2. This telescopic sight is different from the original PSO-1 only in that it lacks the now obsolete Infra-Red detector.

Overall quality was related to <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> and distraction, each having a similar magnitude of effect; however, the result was dependent upon program combination.

40|$|We review queueing-theory {{methods for}} setting {{staffing}} requirements in service systems where customer demand varies in a predictable pattern over the day. Analyzing these systems is not straightforward, because standard queueing theory {{focuses on the}} long-run steady-state behavior of stationary models. We show how to adapt stationary queueing models for use in nonstationary environments so that time-dependent performance is captured and staffing requirements can be set. Relatively little modification of straightforward stationary analysis applies in systems where service times are short and the <b>targeted</b> <b>quality</b> of service is high. When service times are moderate and the <b>targeted</b> <b>quality</b> of service is still high, time-lag refinements can improve traditional stationary independent period-by-period and peak-hour approximations. Time-varying infinite-server models help develop refinements, because closed-form expressions exist for their time-dependent behavior. More difficult cases with very long service times and other complicated features, such as end-of-day effects, can often be treated by a modified-offered-load approximation, {{which is based on}} an associated infinite-server model. Numerical algorithms and deterministic fluid models are useful when the system is overloaded for an extensive period of time.

40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} Time Temperature Integrators (TTIs) as an {{alternative}} means of process evaluation, besides in situ process monitoring and the physical-mathematical method, has {{received a lot of}} attention. The stringent requirement to which an adequate functioning TTI should respond, i. e., the temperature dependence of reaction rate constants for the monitored <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> attribute and the TTI shall be identical, is hard to realize in practice. Therefore, multicomponent TTIs have been suggested to evaluate the integrated impact of time and temperature on a <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> attribute. These monitoring devices consist of a number of temperature sensitive units, each with its own response of reaction rates to temperature. The question how from the combined reading of these individual systems, the impact of the heating process on a <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> parameter can be predicted has not yet been answered. In this theoretical study, we critically consider the restrictions of two interpolation methods in determining the impact on a <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> attribute from the reading of three other temperature sensitive systems. Possibilities of the 'Equivalent Point Method' and a polynomial expression as interpolation method are tested. Success of these transformations depends on kinetic characteristics of the components in the multicomponent TTI system and the actual product temperature history. Since only limited information is available on the product temperature history in processing conditions when TTIs are used, caution must be used in applying these interpolations. A single-component TTI with an activation energy (or z-value) identical to the <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> attribute activation energy (z-value) may be preferable to estimate the impact of the thermal treatment. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model of sales on the champagne wine market. It {{is assumed that}} goods are vertically differentiated on this market with the result that, for a given price, there is a generally accepted rank order. Three categories of actors operate on this market. Wine merchants are few in number but propose large volumes of a high-quality product they alone can provide. Wine growers are numerous, each proposing a small quantity (compared to merchants) of a low-quality product they alone can provide. Buyers are defined by the income available to them to purchase champagne and by their own individual <b>target</b> <b>quality.</b> This <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> (individual taste for product of a given quality) {{can be interpreted as}} a personal (not shared) preference relation based on qualities observed on the market and on the purchaser’s consumer habits. The importance of this behaviour is modulated by what is termed here a ‘myopia parameter’. The consumer’s choice (to buy or not to buy) depends on the surplus derived from four factors: product quality, product price, willingness to pay and <b>target</b> <b>quality.</b> These factors are modulated by the vertical differentiation parameter and the myopia parameter. The model is made dynamic by having the actors make adjustments over time. As bargaining advances, buyers adjust their <b>target</b> <b>quality</b> while sellers adjust their price depending on previous sales. Various simulations were carried out based on different pairings of the myopia and differentiation parameters. The results show that excessive product differentiation combined with a weak myopia parameter make the market unstable...|$|E

The <b>target</b> video <b>quality</b> lower bound captures the MT available energy {{at the beginning of}} the call, the time varying bandwidth availability and channel conditions at different radio interfaces, the target call duration, and the video packet characteristics in terms of distortion impact, delay deadlines, and video packet encoding statistics.
