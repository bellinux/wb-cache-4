50|$|The two {{definitions}} {{most common}} in older literature {{appear to be the}} 15 °C calorie and the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calorie.</b> Until 1948, the latter was defined as 4.1833 international joules; the current standard of 4.184 J was chosen to have the new <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calorie</b> represent the same quantity of energy as before.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} unit of {{measure is}} the Langley (1 <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calorie</b> per square centimeter or 41,840 J/m2) per unit time.|$|E
50|$|These {{values are}} {{mostly from the}} CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 62nd edition. The {{conversion}} between cal/g and J/g in the above table uses the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calorie</b> (calth) = 4.184 joules rather than the International Steam Table calorie (calINT) = 4.1868 joules.|$|E
50|$|A ton of TNT or tonne of TNT is a unit {{of energy}} equal to 109 (<b>thermochemical)</b> <b>calories,</b> {{also known as a}} gigacalorie (Gcal), equal to 4.184 gigajoules (GJ).|$|R
50|$|The SI unit {{of energy}} is the joule. Assuming that a TNT {{explosion}} releases 1,000 small (<b>thermochemical)</b> <b>calories</b> per gram (4.2 kJ/g), one tonne of TNT is equivalent to 4.2 gigajoules.|$|R
50|$|A gram of TNT {{releases}} 980-1100 calories upon explosion. To {{define the}} tonne of TNT, this was arbitrarily standardized by letting 1000 <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calories</b> = 1 gram TNT = 4184 J (exactly).|$|R
50|$|The tonne of {{trinitrotoluene}} (TNT) {{is used as}} a {{proxy for}} energy, usually of explosions (TNT is a common high explosive). Prefixes are used: kiloton(ne), megaton(ne), gigaton(ne), especially for expressing nuclear weapon yield, based on a specific combustion energy of TNT of about 4.2&#160;MJ/kg (or one <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calorie</b> per milligram). Hence, 1 t TNT = 4.2&#160;GJ, 1 kt TNT = 4.2&#160;TJ, 1&#160;Mt TNT = 4.2&#160;PJ.|$|E
5000|$|Mayer {{not only}} {{performed}} this demonstration, but determined also the quantitative factor of the transformation, calculating the mechanical equivalent of heat. The {{result of his}} investigations was published 1842 in the May edition of Justus von Liebig's Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie. It was translated as Remarks on the Forces of Inorganic Nature [...] In his booklet Die organische Bewegung im Zusammenhang mit dem Stoffwechsel (The Organic Movement in Connection with the Metabolism, 1845) he specified the numerical value of the mechanical equivalent of heat: at first as 365 kgf·m/kcal, later as 425 kgf·m/kcal; the modern values are 4.184 kJ/kcal (426.6 kgf·m/kcal) for the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calorie</b> and 4.1868 kJ/kcal (426.9 kgf·m/kcal) for the international steam table calorie.|$|E
5000|$|A ton of TNT equivalent, and its {{multiples}} the kiloton, the megaton, and the gigaton. Often used in {{stating the}} power of very energetic events such as explosions and volcanic events and earthquakes and asteroid impacts. A gram of TNT as a unit of energy {{has been defined as}} 1000 <b>thermochemical</b> <b>calories</b> (...) [...]|$|R
5000|$|The {{kilocalorie}} per mole is a unit {{to measure}} {{an amount of}} energy per number of molecules, atoms, or other similar particles. It is defined as one kilocalorie of energy (1000 <b>thermochemical</b> gram <b>calories)</b> per one mole of substance, that is, per Avogadro’s number of particles. It is abbreviated [...] "kcal/mol" [...] or [...] "kcal mol−1". As typically measured, one kcal/mol represents a temperature increase of one degree Celsius in one liter of water (with a mass of 1kg) resulting from the reaction of one mole of reagents.|$|R
