5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Chesney's {{predecessor}} Alexander {{has been}} credited with commissioning the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of Tournai marble.

5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> Nomura gave him goggles; however, <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E

5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were {{ahead of his}} time.

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>ideas</b> {{about change}} and permanence, or {{becoming}} and Being, was {{the influence that}} led Plato to formulate his theory of forms.

5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} {{a constitutional amendment}} against desegregation busing. He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. <b>This</b> <b>idea,</b> based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented.

5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.

5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety is that such love will be lost.|$|E

5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to be {{recognized}} as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor or just the first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. <b>This</b> <b>idea</b> was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E
