25|$|In many {{healthcare}} systems, prolonged ventilation as part {{of intensive}} care is a limited resource (in that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>so</b> many patients that can receive care at any given moment). It is used to support a single failing organ system (the lungs) and cannot reverse any underlying disease process (such as terminal cancer). For this reason, there can be (occasionally difficult) decisions to be made about whether it is suitable to commence someone on mechanical ventilation. Equally many ethical issues surround the decision to discontinue mechanical ventilation.|$|E

Homer admires her persistence but begins to have doubts, as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>so</b> many shortcuts someone can find. Mrs. Todd's habit of resetting her odometer shows remarkable evidence that something strange is going on. He also discovers evidence that her shortcuts are taking fewer miles than are in a straight line between the trip origin and its destination, something that would be impossible in reality. Mrs. Todd compares the shortcuts to folding a map to bring two points closer together, suggesting she has discovered a warped version of reality, akin to a wormhole.|$|E
