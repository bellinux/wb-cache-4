5|$|While the FAN was {{supplied}} {{economically and}} militarily by Sudan and Egypt, Goukouni received the armed support of Kamougué's FAT and Acyl's CDR {{shortly after the}} beginning of the battle, and was provided with Libyan artillery. On 6 June, the FAN assumed control of the city of Faya. This alarmed Goukouni, and he signed, on 15 June, a Treaty of Friendship with Libya. The treaty gave Libya a free hand in Chad, legitimising its presence in that country; the treaty's first article committed the two countries to mutual defence, and a <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> one constituted a <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> the other.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, {{it seemed}} {{unlikely}} that any media company, particularly the major studios and television network making Inferno and 12 Monkeys, would risk the negative publicity that would come from using the images in the spectrograms and a suggested <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> a U.S. president.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as Ferdinand, Tac HQ ran Otterington. This {{deception}} built a <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Rimini in the east of Italy, in support of Alexander's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line. It developed a pincer movement, in tandem with Ferdinand's threat to the west. However, once Otterington had gotten underway, with a major buildup of dummy armour, Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini. Clarke hastily implemented Ulster, a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the hope it would distract attention from that sector.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Pact, the Scandinavian countries and Finland were relieved. The Germans and Soviets were now allies, and there was no German <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> the Soviet Union. But shortly afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Next, the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, and later Moscow requested that the Baltic states allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement in September, while Latvia and Lithuania followed suit in October.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One of the key elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (although they had earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E

Knox takes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as a drug addict. Zero is sedated, but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby; Knox helps him escape, believing his life is in danger. The two men, Wright and Patterson, quarantine the area, as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease.|$|E

5|$|When {{the emperor}} Macrinus came to power, he {{suppressed}} the <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> his reign {{from the family}} of his assassinated predecessor, Caracalla, by exiling them—Julia Maesa, her two daughters, and her eldest grandson Elagabalus—to their estate at Emesa in Syria. Almost upon arrival in Syria, Maesa began a plot with her advisor and Elagabalus' tutor, Gannys, to overthrow Macrinus and elevate the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus to the imperial throne.|$|E
5|$|Although the ZNDH was {{now able}} to mount a {{credible}} <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> the insurgents, by then a new menace was arriving {{from the other side}} of the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Captains Scarlet and Brown are {{assigned}} to escort the President to the Spectrum Maximum Security Building in New York City. However, both officers are killed when the Mysterons use their powers over matter to engineer the crash of their Spectrum Patrol Car (SPC). From Scarlet and Brown's corpses, the Mysterons create two reconstructions, which are capable of perfectly imitating their biological templates and whose only programmed purpose is to execute the <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> the President. As a first assassination attempt, Brown's duplicate physically explodes after arriving with the President at the Maximum Security Building; although the tower is completely destroyed, the President escapes with his life by activating an emergency door seconds before the detonation.|$|E

5|$|Hardboiled had no {{specific}} {{goal for the}} Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have {{a clear idea of}} what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee, having merely been told that MI5 had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.|$|E

She hides in the closet and struggles to remain conscious. Mercer and Moe enter the room and are about to miss her, but Veronica’s cell phone rings and they knock her out. Parker (Julie Gonzalo) calls attention to Mercer. In addition to a bomb <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Hearst, Dean O’Dell notices his window being egged before a mysterious man enters and the Dean asks “What are you doing here?” Keith arrests Mercer and Moe. Logan intentionally gets himself arrested so he can go into the cell with Mercer and Moe.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens in}} 35,000 B.C., in {{what will become}} North Texas. Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E

5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after {{appearing on the}} verge of collapse and the communist <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive strategy, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} {{with the status quo}} in its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of a}} change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the role that the Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995. She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{column of}} sixteen Spaniards {{retreating}} from Xocorro were ambushed at Guaxeregui and killed to a man. The only {{survivor of the}} expedition was a seriously wounded African slave. The reinforcements sent from Comayagua to the Peñol were also attacked in Cares, and had to fight their way through to join the Spanish at the Peñol, suffering considerable hardship. The citizens of Santa María de Comayagua appealed to Montejo for help, and he sent a dozen mixed cavalry and infantry, who managed {{to break through the}} hostile natives encircling the settlement, and reinforce the town, where they were cut off from further Spanish assistance. Montejo was left with only eleven soldiers, and returned to Gracias a Dios to protect the colonists there, who included women and children. The Indians killed isolated Spaniards wherever they could find them. The natives, seeing the success of their fortress at Cerquín, started construction of a similar fortress near Gracias a Dios, and gathered a great quantity of supplies in storehouses there. Montejo urgently needed to halt their progress, but was unable to attack directly. Instead, he sent an African servant who managed to set the storehouses ablaze. The dismayed Indians of that district then sued for peace. A local Indian ruler called Mota plotted to attack Gracias a Dios, but the plan was betrayed to Monetejo. In a lighning raid, Mota was seized and taken back to Gracias as a prisoner, only to escape and resume his plans for an assault. Montejo eventually discovered his hiding place and launched another rapid raid, and kept him hostage in Gracias under close guard as guarantor of his people, thus defusing the immediate <b>threat</b> <b>against</b> Gracias a Dios.|$|E
