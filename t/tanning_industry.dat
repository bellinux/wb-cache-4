Its ancient forests were {{formerly}} important to the local economy, with wood being used for fuel, construction and bark in the <b>tanning</b> <b>industry.</b> Coppicing is being re-introduced by the EWT to encourage woodland grasses, flowers, invertebrates and birds. A few grasslands on the heavy clays of south- and mid-Essex are still grazed according to traditional methods, supporting a mixture of pasture and fen. Some brownfield sites, often on contaminated soil, have populations of nationally scarce species, particularly invertebrates.|$|E

Today, darker skin {{is viewed as}} fashionable and {{as a sign of}} well-being in some societies. This resulted in the development of <b>tanning</b> <b>industry</b> in several countries. However, in some countries, dark skin is not seen as highly desirable or indicative of higher class, especially among women.|$|E
25|$|With {{the coming}} of Independence and the Civil War, Carrick was {{initially}} occupied by the Anti-Treaty IRA until the town fell to the Free State army in 1922. By this stage, industrialisation had reached Carrick {{with the establishment of}} cotton factories and a local creamery. Most significant however for the economic development of the town was the arrival of the <b>tanning</b> <b>industry</b> in the 1930s, providing regular, dependable employment in the town for the first time. The local town council also embarked on building social housing projects in an effort to deal with appalling living conditions in the town for those economically disadvantaged. Despite these developments, economic opportunities were limited and poverty widespread - the town saw widespread emigration to Dublin, Britain and further afield especially during the long recessions of the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{sunscreen}} commenced to be SPF rated, although SPF labeling in the US was not standardised by the FDA until 1978. In 1971, Mattel introduced Malibu Barbie, {{which had}} tanned skin, sunglasses, and her very own bottle of sun tanning lotion. In 1978, both sunscreen with an SPF 15 rating {{as well as}} tanning beds first appeared. In 2007, there were an estimated 50,000 outlets for indoor tanning; it was a five-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and had spawned an auxiliary industry for indoor tanning lotions including bronzers, intensifiers, and accelerators. Since then, the indoor <b>tanning</b> <b>industry</b> has become more constrained by health regulations. In China, darker skin is still {{considered by many to}} be the mark of the lower classes. As recently as 2012, in some parts of China, ski masks were becoming popular items to wear at the beach in order to protect the wearer's face from the effects of the sun.|$|E
500|$|Chromium(III) salts, {{especially}} {{chrome alum}} and chromium(III) sulfate, {{are used in}} the tanning of leather. The chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the collagen fibers. Chromium tanned leather can contain between 4 and 5% of chromium, which is tightly bound to the proteins. Although the form of chromium used for tanning is not the toxic hexavalent variety, there remains interest in management of chromium in the <b>tanning</b> <b>industry</b> such as recovery and reuse, direct/indirect recycling, use of less chromium or [...] "chrome-less" [...] tanning are practiced to better manage chromium in tanning.|$|E

The Jewish population of Kolkata was 5,000 during World War II, but declined after Indian independence {{and the establishment of}} Israel; by 2013, there were 25 Jews in the city. India's sole Chinatown is in eastern Kolkata; once home to 20,000 ethnic Chinese, its population dropped to around 2,000 [...] as a result of multiple factors including repatriation and denial of Indian citizenship following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and immigration to foreign countries for better economic opportunities.

2500|$|Tanbark {{was used}} to {{manufacture}} tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather <b>tanning</b> <b>industry</b> located in Santa Cruz, and to preserve fish nets. The tanbark was harvested from the isolated trees inland, left to dry, corded, and brought out on mules or hauled out on [...] "go-devils". The go-devil was a wagon with two wheels on the front, while the rear had rails for pulling. Notley constructed a landing {{at the mouth of}} the Palo Colorado River like that at Bixby Landing to the south. The tanbark was loaded by cable onto waiting vessels anchored offshore at Notley's Landing. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of tanbark were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds. A small village grew up around Notley's Landing from 1898 to 1907. [...] Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created.|$|E
2500|$|Nantwich lies on {{the banks}} of the River Weaver on the Cheshire Plain. The town is {{believed}} to have been a salt-producing centre from the 10th century or earlier. A Norman castle was built at the crossing of the Weaver before 1180, probably near where the Crown Inn now stands. Although nothing remains of the castle above ground, it affected the town's layout. During the medieval period, Nantwich was the most important salt town and probably the second most important settlement in the county after Chester. By the 14th century, the town held a weekly cattle market at the end of Beam Street, and was also important for its <b>tanning</b> <b>industry</b> centred on Barker Street. A fire destroyed most of the town to the east of the Weaver in 1583. Elizabeth I personally contributed to the town's rebuilding, which occurred rapidly and followed the plan of the destroyed town. The salt industry peaked in the mid-16th century, with around 400 salt houses in 1530, and had almost died out by the end of the 18th century; the last salt house closed in the mid-19th century. Nikolaus Pevsner considers the decline in the salt industry to have been the critical factor in preserving the town's historic buildings. The town's location on the London to Chester road meant that Nantwich served the needs of travellers from the medieval era. This trade declined in the 19th century, however, with the opening of Telford's road from London to Holyhead, which offered a faster route to Wales, and later when the Grand Junction Railway bypassed the town.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of industrialization in Bangladesh, <b>tanning</b> <b>industries</b> have been playing {{a significant role in the}} country’s economy. Due to its importance as a labor based export oriented industry the full flourish of this industrial sector is essential. But due to the absence of proper waste management, using inferior technologies, lack of facilities for treating industrial wastes; the <b>tanning</b> <b>industries</b> especially located in Hazaribag, Dhaka are aggravating environmental problems day by day. The discharging and dumping of wastes near the water bodies without treatment makes it almost look like an area which is lying under the blanket of pollution. It is an emerging problem not only for the environment but also as the social context of the country. This study focuses on the tanneries of Hazaribag located in Dhaka to assess the present situation arising from such activities and proposed several mitigation measures. This was done by analyzing the affects of various chemicals over human health and the surrounding environment. An Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) was undertaken for assessing several physical, ecological, human use and socio-economic parameters of the surrounding environment of the area.
