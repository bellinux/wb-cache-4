Recently, the discovery of different isoforms of this enzyme, Cyclooxygenase- 1 (COX- 1) and Cyclooxygense- 2 (COX- 2), {{has led to the}} synthesis and introduction of novel drugs with selective inhibitory effect on COX- 2, the isoform produced in pathologic conditions (celecoxib in 1997 and rofecoxib in 1999). This study was carried out to design and synthesize two novel celecoxib derivatives with potential selective COX- 2 inhibitory activity. Method: The derivatives were designed according to the Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) data of selective COX- 2 inhibitors. The condensation reaction of 4 -hydrazinobenzoic acid and 4, 4, 4 -triflouro- 1 -p-tolylbutane- 1, 3 -dione {{led to the formation of}} 4 -(5 -p-tolyl- 3 -(trifluoromethyl) - 1 H-pyrazol- 1 -yl) benzoic acid [8]. The carboxyl group of this acid was reduced to hydroxyl and then converted to chloride by freshly distilled <b>thyonyl</b> chloride. Successive reaction of chloride derivative with sodium sulfite, phosphrous pentachloride and ammonia led to the formation of sulfonamide derivative and reaction of it with sodium azide led to the azide analogue. Results: About 4 grams of each derivative has been synthesized (total yield 60 - 70...|$|E
