50|$|Generally, FM demodulators are not {{affected}} by amplitude variations, since the baseband is contained in the frequency deviations. Some detectors, including the ratio detector, inherently limit gain by a nature of the circuit design.

30|$|After {{analyzing}} the results, {{it can be}} concluded that <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> of <b>the</b> dynamic overloads obtained is mainly caused by rail corrugation, while the average value is mainly caused by geometric variations in the track.

50|$|Vackář {{was also}} {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> of the variable-frequency oscillator {{as it is}} tuned through its range. Ideally, an oscillator's loop gain will be unity according to the Barkhausen stability criterion. In practice, the loop gain is adjusted {{to be a little}} more than one to get the oscillation started; as the amplitude increases, some gain compression then causes the loop gain to average out over a complete cycle to unity. If the VFO frequency is then adjusted, the gain may increase substantially; the result is more gain compression is needed, and that affects both the output amplitude of the VFO and its frequency stability.|$|E
50|$|These {{amplitude}} equations {{have been}} limited to the lowest order nontrivial nonlinearities. The solutions that interest us in stellar pulsation theory are the asymtotic solutions (time → infinity) because the time scale for <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> is generally very short compared to the evolution time scale of the star which is the nuclear burning time scale. The equationsabove have fixed point solutions with constant amplitudes, corresponding to single-mode(A1 0, A2 = 0) or(A1 = 0, A2 0) and double-mode(A1 0, A20)solutions. These correspond to singly periodic and doubly periodic pulsations of the star. It is important to emphasize that no other asymptotic solution of the above equations exists for physical (i.e., negative) coupling coefficients.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s, Phonofilm {{and other}} early motion picture sound systems {{employed}} optical recording technology, {{in which the}} audio signal was graphically recorded on photographic film. <b>The</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> comprising the signal were used to modulate a light source which was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing the signal to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a [...] "sound track". The projector used a steady light and a photoelectric cell to convert these variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to loudspeakers behind the screen. Ironically, the introduction of [...] "talkies" [...] was spearheaded by The Jazz Singer (1927), which used the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system rather than an optical soundtrack. Optical sound became the standard motion picture audio system throughout the world and remains so for theatrical release prints despite attempts in the 1950s to substitute magnetic soundtracks. Currently, all release prints on 35 mm film include an analog optical soundtrack, usually stereo with Dolby SR noise reduction. In addition, an optically recorded digital soundtrack in Dolby Digital and/or Sony SDDS form {{is likely to be}} present. An optically recorded timecode is also commonly included to synchronise CDROMs that contain a DTS soundtrack.|$|E

40|$|Subducted density {{compensated}} temperature anomalies have been invoked {{as a possible}} way for mid-latitudes to alter the climate variability of equatorial regions through the so-called `thermocline bridge', both in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The validity of this mechanism, however, depends crucially on whether such temperature anomalies can reach the equatorial regions sufficiently undamped to alter significantly the local heat balance. In this paper, the dynamics of density {{compensated temperature}} and salinity anomalies, {{also known as the}} `spiciness mode', is investigated theoretically, with the aim of getting insights into the physical and thermodynamical mechanisms affecting <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> of such anomalies...|$|E
40|$|The Lempel-Ziv {{complexity}} (LZ) {{has been}} widely {{used to evaluate the}} randomness of finite sequences. In general, the LZ complexity has been used to determine the complexity grade present in biomedical signals. The LZ complexity is not able to discern between signals with different amplitude variations and similar random components. On the other hand, amplitude parameters, as the root mean square (RMS), are not able to discern between signals with similar power distributions and different random components. In this work, we present a novel method to quantify amplitude and complexity variations in biomedical signals by means of the computation of the LZ coefficient using more than two quantification states, and with thresholds fixed and independent of the dynamic range or standard deviation of the analyzed signal: the Multistate Lempel-Ziv (MLZ) index. Our results indicate that MLZ index with few quantification levels only evaluate the complexity changes of the signal, with high number of levels, <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations,</b> and with an intermediate number of levels informs about both amplitude and complexity variations. The study performed in diaphragmatic mechanomyographic signals shows that <b>the</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>variations</b> of this signal are more correlated with the respiratory effort than the complexity variations. Furthermore, it has been observed that the MLZ index with high number of levels practically is not affected by the existence of impulsive, sinusoidal, constant and Gaussian noises compared with the RMS amplitude parameter.
