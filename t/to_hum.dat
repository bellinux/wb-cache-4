5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

Moments before the wedding, Nisha asks Prem's dog Tuffy to give Prem the necklace that Pooja had given her, along with a letter. Tuffy exits Nisha's room and instead of taking the letter to Prem, delivers it to Rajesh. Rajesh reads the letter and realizes that Prem and Nisha love each other. Subsequently, he halts the wedding and confronts both Nisha and Prem. In the end, Nisha and Prem marry each other {{with the consent of}} their families.

5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E

25|$|Plácido Domingo {{was born}} on January 21, 1941 in the Retiro {{district}} of Madrid, Spain. His mother recalled {{that she and her}} husband knew he would be a musician from the age of five, due to his ability <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> complex music from a zarzuela after seeing a performance of it. In 1949, just days before his eighth birthday, he moved to Mexico with his family. His parents, both singers, had decided to start a zarzuela company there after a successful tour of Latin America. Soon after arriving in Mexico, Domingo won a singing contest for boys, and his parents occasionally recruited him and his sister for children's roles in their zarzuela productions. Domingo studied piano from a young age, at first privately and later at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, which he entered when he was fourteen. At the conservatory, he also attended conducting classes taught by Igor Markevitch and studied voice under Carlo Morelli, the brother of Renato Zanelli. The two brothers were famous practitioners of both baritone and tenor roles. Domingo's conservatory classes constituted the entirety of his formal vocal instruction; he never studied privately with a singing teacher.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)". Derived from {{the theme of}} The $64,000 Question, the song was written by Redding and Cropper and its lyrics are about Redding's habit <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> or sing the horn lines. David Porter served as the {{background}} singer, singing the [...] "fa-fa-fa-fa-fa" [...] part alongside Redding.|$|E
500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} performance, critical {{reactions to}} the song were mixed to positive. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, {{in a review of}} Megalomania, viewed [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] as one of the highlight songs of the album saying, [...] "The sweeping strings, inspired sound effects, and driving country-pop melodies of the lushly produced opener 'Playmate to Jesus', [...] shows the reunion hasn't been completely without merit." [...] Time said the song [...] "has the dubious distinction of sounding vaguely like a Lady Gaga track that didn’t pass quality control," [...] but was [...] "relatively catchy, boasting the kind of musical infectiousness that causes you <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> it under your breath on the subway." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Rajani Mazumdar {{compared}} Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... <b>to</b> <b>Hum</b> Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) {{and added}} that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a [...] "spectacular stage that moves across global locations". She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places– the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk. While the Raichand house is described as [...] "expensive, almost like a museum", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note {{of the use of}} frontal camera angles {{in order to ensure that}} the [...] "spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} references to pop culture. Elaine mentions that a man she knows used to nod at her whenever she saw him, but suddenly stopped, leading her to state, [...] " [...] he went from nods to nothing." [...] This prompts George <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> the Tony Bennett song [...] "Rags to Riches", replacing the chorus with [...] "nods to nothing". During a discussion with Elaine, Jerry mentions the 1958 film The Blob. Jerry also mentions the novel Moby Dick, jokingly stating that [...] "when you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends".

500|$|The liberal {{political}} party Yabloko {{stated that the}} re-adoption of the Soviet anthem [...] "deepened the schism in [...] society". The Soviet anthem {{was supported by the}} Communist Party and by Putin himself. The other national symbols used by Russia in 1990, the white-blue-red flag and the double-headed eagle coat of arms, were also given legal approval by Putin in December, thus ending the debate over the national symbols. After all of the symbols were adopted, Putin said on television that this move was needed to heal Russia's past and to fuse the period of the Soviet Union with Russia's history. He also stated that, while Russia's march towards democracy would not be stopped, the rejection of the Soviet era would have left the lives of their mothers and fathers bereft of meaning. It took some time for the Russian people to familiarize themselves with the anthem's lyrics; athletes were only able <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> along with the anthem during the medal ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
500|$|... "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] {{was one of}} {{the very}} first {{psychedelic}} instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band. It was seen as Pink Floyd's first foray into space rock (along with [...] "Astronomy Domine"), although band members would later disparage this term. [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> a song he could not remember the name of (most commonly identified as Love's cover of [...] "My Little Red Book"). Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett followed Jenner's humming with his guitar and used it {{as the basis for the}} principal melody of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Bassist Roger Waters once told Barrett that the song's riff reminded him of the theme tune from Steptoe and Son (by Ron Grainer). Around the time the song was written, Barrett was also inspired by AMM and their guitarist Keith Rowe, who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar's fretboard. The free-form section (and also, [...] "Pow R. Toc H.") was inspired by Frank Zappa's free-form freak-outs and The Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High".|$|E

[...] Billboard cited it as Wilco's [...] "most difficult and uncompromising album to date." [...] Akiva Gottlieb of Stylus Magazine praised A Ghost Is Born as being [...] "even more brilliant" [...] than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, a sentiment echoed by Michael Metevier of PopMatters, who added that the album made him [...] "surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club wrote that A Ghost Is Born [...] "channels its shaggy sound into pop music" [...] that [...] "constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence, but it's still hard not <b>to</b> <b>hum</b> along." [...] James Hunter of The Village Voice felt that [...] "Wilco's ideas are unremarkable, but are worked out with intelligence and striking conception. And as it happens, the new organic emphasis tables some of Wilco's lamer stylistic obsessions." [...] Q called the album [...] "more meandering" [...] than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but also [...] "more confident, more coherent, yielding an all-enveloping warmth that's entirely resistant to any iPod shuffle function." ...|$|E
