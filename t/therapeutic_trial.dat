2500|$|Patients {{frequently}} show improvement {{even when}} given a sham or [...] "fake" [...] treatment. Such intentionally inert placebo treatments {{can take many}} forms, such as a pill containing only sugar, a surgery where nothing efficacious is actually done (just an incision and sometimes some minor touching or handling of the underlying structures), or a medical device (such as an ultrasound machine) that is not actually turned on. Also, due to the body's natural healing ability and statistical effects such as regression to the mean, many patients will get better even when given no treatment at all. Thus, the relevant question when assessing a treatment is not [...] "does the treatment work?" [...] but [...] "does the treatment work better than a placebo treatment, or no treatment at all?" [...] As one early clinical trial researcher wrote, [...] "the first object of a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trial</b> is to discover whether the patients who receive the treatment under investigation are cured more rapidly, more completely or more frequently, {{than they would have}} been without it." [...] More broadly, the aim of a clinical trial is to determine what treatments, delivered in what circumstances, to which patients, in what conditions, are the most effective.|$|E
40|$|Fifty-foot walking {{time was}} used in 51 of 187 {{clinical}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trials</b> of antirheumatic drugs and in only 21 instances was statistical significance reached. Measurement of the 50 -foot walking time showed no better performance in long-term trials of SAARDs than in short-term trials of NSAIDs. It is concluded that the 50 -foot walking time is a poor outcome measure in rheumatic disease trials, despite a high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility.

DESPITE criticism of its use, the 50 -foot walking time remains a hallowed outcome measure in clinical <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trials</b> of antirheumatic drugs. The Dictionary of the Rheumatic Diseases [1] emphasizes its lack of validity, while one-third of participants at a Conference on Outcome Measures [2] assigned it a score of zero when asked to number each of 20 outcome measures used in rheumatological clinical trials according to importance.

Factors that should prompt consideration of preventive therapy include the occurrence {{of two or more}} migraines per month with disability lasting three or more days per month; failure of, contraindication for, or adverse events from acute treatments; use of abortive medication more than twice per week; and uncommon migraine conditions (e.g., hemiplegic migraine, migraine with prolonged aura, migrainous infarction). Patient preference and cost also should be considered....Therapy should be initiated with medications that have the highest levels of effectiveness and the lowest potential for adverse reactions; these should be started at low dosages and titrated slowly. A full <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trial</b> may take two to six months. After successful therapy (e.g., reduction of migraine frequency by approximately 50 percent or more) has been maintained for six to 12 months, discontinuation of preventive therapy can be considered.|$|E

Morning serum cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and sleeping cortisol concentrations were significantly raised.

40|$|The immense {{progress}} made in childhood cancer survival has {{been due to}} the systematic and efficient conduct of large multicenter <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trials,</b> using the infrastructure developed by national cooperative groups.

However, participation in nontherapeutic trials in the cooperative group set-ting has lagged behind that of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trials</b> for a variety of reasons, such as lack of institutional resources, leading to low priority given to such acti-vities. The purpose of this report is to share some of the methods developed and successfully implemented by a coordinating center (City of Hope National Medical Center) to maximize institutional participation and patient enrollment and to standardize data collection and quality control, in order to ensure the successful execution of two large, extramurally funded, coopera-tive group nontherapeutic studies. To date, over 175 institutions have obtained regulatory approval for the protocols showcased here, accrual has been on target, and completeness and quality of the collected data have been excellent. The successful execution of these non-therapeutic studies shows the advantages of diverse study publicity techniques, detailed standardized ope-rating procedures, and effective utilization of techno-logical resources.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} cerclage, with and without cervical occlusion. DESIGN: Multicentre, stratified, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Hospital-based multicentre study with 18 tertiary centres from nine countries. POPULATION: Women {{with a history of}} cervical insufficiency (prophylactic trial) and women with a short cervix (<b>therapeutic</b> <b>trial)</b> were recruited from August 2006 to August 2011. METHODS: A centralised telephone randomisation service with a computer system was used to randomise women to cervical cerclage with or without cervical occlusion. Only the analyst performing the interim analyses was blinded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The take-home baby rate (number of infants discharged alive from the hospital), gestational age at delivery, and the number of days in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). RESULTS: Women (n = 309) were stratified into the prophylactic trial (n = 213) or the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trial</b> (n = 96). The trial stopped early due to slow recruitment and an interim analysis showing no benefit of occlusion. Final analysis comprised 197 women in the prophylactic trial and 87 women in the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trial.</b> No added effect of cervical occlusion was found in terms of the take-home baby rate in the prophylactic trial (92 versus 90 %, RR 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 94 - 1. 12) or in the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>trial</b> (81 versus 85 %, RR 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 79 - 1. 16). No effect of cervical occlusion was found in terms of gestational age at delivery and number of days the neonate spent in the NICU. Cervical occlusion was associated with no harm. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical occlusion with cerclage had no significant additional effect.
