40|$|A new {{midwater}} trawl for sampling deepsea nekton from discrete depths is described. Its mouth area is about 50 m 2. The <b>trawl</b> <b>body</b> {{is lined with}} small mesh netting and terminates in a 5 -net opening-closing codend device. Problems of delayed flushing of animals into the codend and of entanglement of animals in the netting were not acute. Compared to a 5. 4 m 2 Isaacs-Kidd {{midwater trawl}}, this trawl catches many more individuals and species of fishes and larger sizes of some fishes and cephalopods. This net will be most useful in sampling sparsely populated mesopelagic and bathypelagic waters...|$|E
40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a twin trawl setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm diamond meshes in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency. Around 85 % of saithe, 80 % of haddock, 44 % of witch flounder, 55 % of lemon sole, and 55 % of cod (below 68 cm) contacted the large mesh panel and escaped. We also demonstrated the need to account for potential selectivity in the <b>trawl</b> <b>body,</b> as it can bias the assessment of length-based escape behaviour. Our indirect assessment of fish behaviour was in agreement with the direct observations made for the same species in a similar section of the <b>trawl</b> <b>body</b> reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to a shift towards directed targeting of whiting, Sillago spp. by some penaeid trawlers in coastal waters off New South Wales, Australia, 3 experiments were done {{to examine the effects}} on the size and species selectivity of trawls associated with (i) a 40 % increase in mesh size used in the body, (ii) altering the configuration of mesh in the codend, and (iii) a separating grid in the extension section. Each experiment involved paired comparisons between conventional and modified gears during normal commercial fishing operations. The results showed that increasing mesh size in the <b>trawl</b> <b>body</b> from 45 to 63 mm had no effect on any catches and, while the grid has the potential to improve species selection by excluding macrofauna, further refinement and testing are required to minimize the escape of commercial sized whiting. Changing the orientation of mesh in the codend from diamond- (40 mm mesh opening) to square-shaped (41 mm mesh, hung on the bar) had a highly significant effect on the size selection of red spot whiting, Sillago flindersi: reducing the catches of small, unwanted individuals (< 17 cm total length) by up to 99 %, with minimal impact on the retention of larger, commercial sized individuals. We conclude that the use of square-mesh codends (with a bar length approaching 20 mm) by trawlers targeting whiting is an appropriate management tool for minimizing the fishing mortality of juvenile and maturing conspecifics...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to test a prototype species-selective bottom trawl for separating cod from haddock, secondarily saithe, in the Norwegian commercial roundfish fisheries. A sorting system incorporating a horizontal square mesh panel (150 mm bar length) dividing the <b>trawl's</b> <b>body</b> and extension sections into upper and lower compartments, leading aft to vertically-oriented trouser codends, was installed in a commercial roundfish trawl. First tests of the system, fishing around the clock, demonstrated approximately 90 % haddock separation in to the upper codend, 71 % cod separation in to the lower codend, and 72 % saithe separation into the upper codend. In situ video observations showed that fish, apparently haddock, entered the trawl at all levels, but subsequently many {{of those in the}} lower half attacked upwards and through the separating panel along its length as they passed towards the trouser codends. Applicability of the sorting system to commercial fisheries is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies with}} a new 17 m {{parallel}} twin-body trawl and a 17 m bulged belly trawl conducted off Cochin during 1974 - 77 are reported. The parallel twin <b>body</b> <b>trawl</b> showed an increase of 28 % in catch over that of bulged belly with a break up of 39. 9 % and 23. 1 % for prawns and fishes respectively. The increase in catch is attributed to the extra wide mouth opening (26. 6 %) of the parallel twin-body trawl. Parallel twin-body trawl had 8. 96 % lesser resistance which resulted in lower utilization of horse power...|$|R
40|$|Kaidun is a {{brecciated}} meteorite containing {{many different}} types of meteorites. It is composed of carbonaceous, enstatite, ordinary and R chondrites with smaller amounts of basaltic achondrites, impact melt products and unknown [1, 2]. Because of the multiple components and high abundance of carbonaceous chondrites, the Kaidun parent body was probably a large C-type asteroid in order to have accumulated clasts of many unrelated asteroids, and thus Kaidun contains previously unknown materials[1]. It has been suggested that the Kaidun parent <b>body</b> <b>trawled</b> through different regions of the solar system [3], but the formation of Kaidun meteorite is still uncertain. In this abstract, we report the first discovery of a brachinite-like clast in Kaidun...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{reducing}} mesh size while concomitantly varying the side taper and wing depth of a generic penaeid-trawl body were investigated to improve engineering performance and minimize bycatch. Five trawl bodies (with the same codends) were tested across various environmental (e. g. depth and current) and biological (e. g. species and sizes) conditions. The first <b>trawl</b> <b>body</b> comprised 41 -mm mesh and represented conventional designs (termed the ' 41 long deep-wing'), while the remaining trawl bodies {{were made from}} 32 -mm mesh and differed only in their side tapers, and therefore length (i. e. 1 N 3 B or 'long' and ∼ 28 o to the tow direction vs 1 N 5 B or 'short' and ∼ 35 o) and wing depths ('deep'- 97 T vs 'shallow'- 60 T). There were incremental drag reductions (and therefore fuel savings [...] by up to 18 and 12 % per h and ha trawled) associated with reducing twine area via either modification, and subsequently minimizing otter-board area in attempts to standardize spread. Side taper and wing depth had interactive and varied effects on species selectivity, but compared to the conventional 41 long deep-wing trawl, the 32 short shallow-wing trawl (i. e. the least twine area) reduced the total bycatch by 57 % (attributed to more fish swimming forward and escaping). In most cases, all small-meshed trawls also caught more smaller school prawns Metapenaeus macleayi but to decrease this effect {{it should be possible}} to increase mesh size slightly, while still maintaining the above engineering benefits and species selectivity. The results support precisely optimizing mesh size as a precursor to any other anterior penaeid-trawl modifications designed to improve environmental performance...|$|E
