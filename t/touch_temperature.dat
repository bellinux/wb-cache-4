5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature</b> readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
25|$|The cornea has unmyelinated {{nerve endings}} {{sensitive}} to <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature</b> and chemicals; {{a touch of}} the cornea causes an involuntary reflex to close the eyelid. Because transparency is of prime importance, the cornea does not have blood vessels. Instead, oxygen dissolves in tears and then diffuses throughout the cornea to keep it healthy. Similarly, nutrients are transported via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface, and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibres that innervate it. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5mm and a thickness of 0.5–0.6mm in the center and 0.6–0.8mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and immunologic privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.|$|E

50|$|The {{somatosensory}} {{system is a}} complex sensory system {{made up of a}} number of different receptors, including thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors.

50|$|The {{somatosensory}} system comprises a {{diverse range of}} receptors and processing centers to produce the perception of <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature,</b> proprioception, and nociception. Receptors are located throughout the body including the skin, epithelia, internal organs, skeletal muscles, bones, and joints. The cutaneous receptors of the skin project {{in an orderly fashion}} to the spinal cord, and from there, via different afferent pathways (dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract and spinothalamic tract), to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus and the primary somatosensory cortex. Again, adjacent areas on the skin are represented by adjacent neurons in all aforementioned structures. This projection pattern has been termed somatotopy.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} of trigeminal {{neuralgia}} the affected nerves are responsible for sensing <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature</b> sensation and pressure sensation in the facial area from the jaw to the forehead. The disorder generally causes short episodes of excruciating pain, usually for {{less than two minutes}} and usually only one side of the face. The pain can be described {{in a variety of ways}} such as [...] "stabbing", [...] "sharp", [...] "like lightning", [...] "burning", and even [...] "itchy". In the atypical form of TN, the pain presents itself as severe constant aching along the nerve. The pain associated with TN is recognized as one of the most excruciating pains that can be experienced.|$|E
5000|$|When {{assessing}} neuralgia to {{find the}} underlying mechanism, {{a history of the}} pain, description of pain, physical examination, and experimental examination are required. Since pain is subjective to the patient, it is important to use a pain assessment scale, such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire. [...] Qualifying the severity of the pain is essential in diagnosis and in evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment. Physical examinations usually involve testing responses to stimuli such as <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and vibration. Neuralgia can be further classified by the type of stimuli that elicits a response: mechanical, thermal, or chemical. Response to the course of treatment is the final tool used to determine the mechanism of the pain. Future research must focus on the relationships between all of these categories.|$|E

50|$|Afferent neurons' somas {{are located}} in the ganglia of the {{peripheral}} nervous system, and the axons of these cells travel from ganglion to ganglion and lead back to the spinal cord. The majority of these are unipolar neurons in that they have a single axon leaving the cell body and is sent towards the sensory organ. All of the axons in the dorsal root, which contains afferent nerve fibers, are used in the transduction of somatosensory information. Somatosensory receptors include senses such as pain, <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature,</b> itch, and stretch. For example, a specific muscle fiber called an intrafusal muscle fiber is a type of afferent neuron that lies parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers thus functions as a stretch receptor by detecting muscle length. All of these sensations travel along the same general pathway towards the brain, from the dorsal root ganglion they travel to the spinal cord. From the spinal cord to the medulla, which then leads to the medial lemniscus of the midbrain. From here it travels to the primary somatosensory cortex of the parietal lobe.|$|E
50|$|Research has {{suggested}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, rather than having bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{is based on the}} presence of enamel, which may need to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. In modern terrestrial animals with bare teeth, the teeth typically lack {{some or all of the}} standard amount of tooth enamel. Because Tyrannosaurus and other toothed theropods had enamel-covered teeth, they would have required some sort of lip-like covering to seal the mouth when closed. However, the discovery that Daspletosaurus horneri, a related genus, seemingly did not possess lips and instead seems to have possessed large scales similar to those of crocodiles on its face. Based on comparisons of bone texture of D. horneri with crocodilians, this suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus horneri also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in <b>touch,</b> <b>temperature</b> readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
40|$|Defining <b>touch</b> <b>temperature</b> {{limits for}} skin contact with both {{hot and cold}} objects is {{important}} to prevent pain and skin damage, which may affect task performance or become a safety concern. Pain and skin damage depend on the resulting skin temperature during contact, which depends on the object s initial temperature, its material properties {{and its ability to}} transfer heat. However, previous spacecraft standards have incorrectly defined <b>touch</b> <b>temperature</b> limits in terms of a single object temperature value for all materials, or have provided limited material-specific values which do not cover the gamut of most designs. A new approach is being used in new NASA standards, which defines <b>touch</b> <b>temperature</b> limits in terms of skin temperature at pain onset for bare skin contact with hot and cold objects. The authors have developed an analytical verification method for safe hot and cold object temperatures for contact times from 1 second to infinity...|$|E
