5|$|The {{first model}} in production, in June 1935, was the Model A. It {{contained}} {{most of the}} features {{that came to be}} standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of drawbars for each manual, and one for <b>the</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to <b>the</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using <b>the</b> <b>pedals.</b> As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound egress {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to <b>the</b> <b>pedals.</b> The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E

Unification also makes it possible to play any rank of pipes from any manual and <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> independently, unlike a traditional church organ, where a rank of pipes is playable only from one manual or <b>the</b> <b>pedals,</b> unless couplers are employed.|$|E

25|$|Note that if {{a normal}} right-side-drive {{crankset}} is installed backwards to create a left-side-drive bicycle, the threaded pedal holes {{at the end of}} the crank arms would be reversed. In this configuration, precession may loosen <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> over time, causing <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the crank arms. A front crankset designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a chainring for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of chainring sizes may be limited.|$|E

50|$|This {{force can}} be further {{increased}} by inserting a lever connected between the master piston, a pedal, and a pivot point. If the distance from <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> to <b>the</b> pivot is three times {{the distance from the}} pivot to the connected piston, then it multiplies <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> force by a factor of 3, when pushing down on <b>the</b> <b>pedal,</b> so that 10 N becomes 30 N on the master piston and 120 N on the brake pad. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> must move three times as far as the master piston. If we push <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> 120 mm down, the master piston will move 40 mm and the slave piston will move the brake pad by 10 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Dieterich Buxtehude (1637-1707), who was {{the most}} renowned {{composer}} of his time, was famous for his [...] "virtuosity and innovation at <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> board."

50|$|A {{curve is}} called equichordal {{when it has}} an equichordal point. Such a curve may be {{constructed}} as <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> curve of a curve of constant width.

25|$|Some penny-farthing riders {{used only}} back {{pedalling}} and got off {{and walked down}} steep hills, but most also used a brake.

Putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{motorized}} bicycle or motorbike varies widely according to intended use. Some motorized bicycles are powerful enough to be self-propelled, without use of <b>the</b> <b>pedals.</b> A development of the motorized bicycle is the moped, which commonly has only a vestigial pedal drive fitted primarily to satisfy legal requirements, and suitable only for starting the engine or for emergency use. The alternate design philosophy to the moped is the so-called motor-assist or pedal-assist bicycle. These machines utilize <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> as the dominant form of propulsion, with the motor used only to give extra assistance when needed for hills or long journeys.|$|E

25|$|Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals {{that require}} a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> and thus holds the shoe firmly to <b>the</b> <b>pedal.</b> Most clipless <b>pedals</b> lock onto <b>the</b> cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases the}} locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of <b>the</b> <b>pedal.</b> <b>The</b> clipless <b>pedal</b> was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.|$|R
25|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} {{have been}} demonstrated and marketed for both derailleur and hub gear mechanisms, often accompanied by a warning to disengage auto-shifting if standing on <b>the</b> <b>pedals.</b> These have met with limited market success.|$|E
25|$|In {{slippery}} conditions some riders {{prefer to}} ride fixed {{because they believe}} the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, {{there is also an}} increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of <b>the</b> <b>pedals,</b> shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel to allow <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, {{so that the}} rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that <b>the</b> <b>pedals</b> are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E

50|$|The issue {{involves}} a friction device in <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> {{designed to provide}} the proper “feel” by adding resistance and making <b>the</b> <b>pedal</b> steady and stable.
