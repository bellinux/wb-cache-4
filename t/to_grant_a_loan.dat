Fay and Williams (1991) found that when identical loan applications were submitted by men and women, women were less likely <b>to</b> be <b>granted</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan.</b> It was proposed in this study that gender discrimination could be occurring as a result of bank loan officers attitudes about women as successful business owners. Seventy bank loan officers from North Island branches of the ANZ, ASB and WestpacTrust banks filled in questionnaires assessing their attitudes towards women, men and successful business owners (Buttner & Rosen, 1988). Bank loan officers also read <b>a</b> mock <b>loan</b> application (Fay & Williams, 1991) and indicated whether they would grant the loan.

We derive a Value at Risk measure for the sample portfolio of loans and show how analyzing this can enable financial institutions to evaluate alternative lending policies on the basis of their implied credit risk and loss rate, and make lending rates consistent with the implied Value at Risk.

50|$|Many {{businesses}} have {{to account for}} risk exposure due to their different services and determine the cost needed to cover the risk. For example, auto insurance providers need to accurately {{determine the amount of}} premium to charge to cover each automobile and driver. A financial company needs to assess a borrower's potential and ability <b>to</b> pay before <b>granting</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan.</b> For <b>a</b> health insurance provider, predictive analytics can analyze a few years of past medical claims data, as well as lab, pharmacy and other records where available, to predict how expensive an enrollee is likely to be in the future. Predictive analytics can help underwrite these quantities by predicting the chances of illness, default, bankruptcy, etc. Predictive analytics can streamline the process of customer acquisition by predicting the future risk behavior of a customer using application level data. Predictive analytics in the form of credit scores have reduced the amount of time it takes for loan approvals, especially in the mortgage market where lending decisions are now made {{in a matter of hours}} rather than days or even weeks. Proper predictive analytics can lead to proper pricing decisions, which can help mitigate future risk of default.|$|R
40|$|Public {{policies}} to support entrepreneurship and innovation {{play a vital}} role when firms have difficulties in accessing external finance. However, some authors have found evidence of long-term inefficiency in subsidized firms (Bernini and Pelligrini, 2011; Cerqua and Pelligrini, 2014) and ineffectiveness of public funds (Jorge and Suárez, 2011). The aim of the paper is to assess the effectiveness in the selection process of applications to public financial support for stimulating innovation. Using a binary choice model, we investigate which factors influence the probability of obtaining public support for an innovative investment. The explanatory variables are connected to firm profile, the characteristics of the project and the macroeconomic environment. The analysis is based on the case study of the Portuguese Innovation. Incentive System (PIIS) and on the applications managed by the Alentejo Regional Operational Program in the period 2007 – 2013. The results show that the selection process is more focused on the expected impact of the project than on the firm’s past performance. Factors that influence the credit risk and the decision <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> bank <b>loan</b> do not seem to influence the government evaluator regarding the funding of some projects. Past activities in R&D do not significantly affect the probability of having an application approved under the PIIS, whereas {{an increase in the number}} of patents and the number of skilled jobs are both relevant factors. Nevertheless, some evidence of firms’ short-term inefficiency was found, in that receiving public financial support is linked to a smaller increase in productivity compared to non-approved firm applications. At the macroeconomic level, periods with a higher cost of capital in financial markets are linked to a greater probability of getting an application for public support approved, which could be associated with the effectiveness of public support in correcting market failings...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} law {{concerned}} {{with the role of}} banks as their customers' financial advisers in England and Germany. At present, the law related to financial advice in England and Germany appears to be a motley conglomerate of isolated concepts and lines of authority which fail to form a homogenous body of rules capable of guiding those who are involved in the banking business. Recent developments such as the 'misselling' of pension funds and other investment products have undermined consumer confidence in the financial services industry and have raised the question whether the present legal concepts can still be seen as adequate means to protect the interests of consumers. This thesis argues that the duties of banks which assume the role of their customers' financial adviser should be extended so as to ensure that only those financial products are sold to customers which are positively suitable to their individual needs. Furthermore, it is argued that banks which provide their customers with investment advice should disclose to them any substantial conflict of interest on their part. Additionally, the duties of lenders should also be in creased. This thesis maintains that, in certain circumstances, there should be an obligation {{on the part of a}} lender not <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to a financially inexperienced consumer. Furthermore, it is argued that - with regard to third party guarantees involving substantial financial risks for the guarantor - a lender should be under the obligation to ensure that the guarantor receives independent legal advice before signing the guarantee agreement. On a more general level, this thesis calls for the development of a partnership between banks and their customers and regards it as the law's task to counterbalance existing inequalities of bargaining powers between banks and their customer to further the forming of such a partnership. It also supports the idea of informal conflict resolution systems such as the Banking Ombudsman Scheme. </p...|$|E
40|$|In Sweden we have {{environmental}} objectives to achieve {{for the year}} 2020. Swedish banks have a responsibility {{like everyone else in}} a society to act environmentally responsible. When Swedish banks are lending to SMEs they are taking a risk, however, banks are risk averse and want to minimize their risk. By lending to a company that does not take environmental responsibility the risk are increasing. In this study we want to research if Swedish banks take environmental responsibility of companies into account when lending to SMEs. Previous studies show that banks do make an environmental consideration when lending to companies, but there is lack of similar studies in Swedish banks. Additionally, the previous findings have shown to be contradictory. We also thought {{it would be interesting to}} see whether Swedish banks are familiar with the {{environmental objectives}} since we are not far from 2020. Additionally, we want to find out if there have been any changes since previous years, and if Swedish banks work differently with environmental issues in their lending process to SMEs. Thus, our problem statement is: Do Swedish banks take SMEs environmental responsibility into account in the lending process? And are the Swedish banks familiar with the environmental objectives? Some theories that are discussed in this study are the environmental risks that the banks are exposing themselves to when lending to SMEs. The environmental risks are divided into three categories, reputational risk, direct risk and indirect risk. Another theory that we discuss is the information asymmetry, which also affects the lending process. <b>To</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> that is not too risky for the bank, and still fair to the company, the bank need to make an assessment. The assessment is based on the information SMEs gives Swedish banks and therefore the companies have the possibility to not be completely truthful. This is a quantitative research with a deductive approach, and in order to get our results we sent out surveys to Swedish banks that work with lending to SMEs. A total of 75 surveys were sent to the Swedish banks and the 32 answers we received constituted a response rate of 51, 6 % since only 62 surveys reached the respondents. The result from our survey showed that Swedish banks do take the environmental responsibility of the company into account when lending to SMEs, however, they are not familiar with the environmental objectives. Thus, they do consider the companies’ environmental responsibility when granting loans to SMEs, however, we do not know whether the environmental objectives are included in this process or not. We could also see from the result of our survey that Swedish banks environmental responsibility has change with time. The conclusion of this research is that Swedish banks do take environmental responsibility of the company into account when lending to SMEs. This is something they should consider to develop and incorporate in their environmental work. However, they are not familiar with the environmental objectives...|$|E

When the Business Development Bank refused to extend the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime was a businessman with a bad reputation with a history for losing money on past business ventures and that he was already behind on his current payments, the president of the bank François Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suit that Beaudoin was to win in 2004. It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. The Prime Minister's ethics counsellor Howard Wilson, who was appointed by and reported to the Prime Minister, determined that Prime Minister Chrétien had not violated any conflict-of-interest rules, noting that there were no clear rules on lobbying Crown corporations for making loans to business ventures that the Prime Minister may or may not had a stake in. There was no comment on ethics of Chrétien's lobbying by the ethics counsellor Wilson. The revelation of the Grand-Mere affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mere story during the election was the work of the Martin fraction.|$|R

The Library of Congress writes that 'in 1962 the Soviet Union agreed <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>a</b> US$32 million <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> modernise the Somali army, and expand it to 14,000 personnel. Moscow later increased the amount to US$55 million. The Soviet Union, seeking to counter United States influence in the Horn of Africa, made <b>an</b> unconditional <b>loan</b> and fixed <b>a</b> generous twenty-year repayment schedule.'The army was tested in 1964 when the conflict with Ethiopia over the Somali-inhabited Ogaden erupted into warfare. On 16 June 1963, Somali guerrillas started an insurgency at Hodayo, in eastern Ethiopia, a watering place north of Werder, after Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie rejected their demand for self-government in the Ogaden. The Somali government initially refused to support the guerrilla forces, which eventually numbered about 3,000. However, in January 1964, after Ethiopia sent reinforcements to the Ogaden, Somali forces launched ground and air attacks across the border and started providing assistance to the guerrillas. The Ethiopian Air Force responded with punitive strikes across its southwestern frontier against Feerfeer, northeast of Beledweyne and Galkayo. On 6 March 1964, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed to a cease-fire. At the end of the month, the two sides signed an accord in Khartoum, Sudan, agreeing to withdraw their troops from the border, cease hostile propaganda, and start peace negotiations. Somalia also terminated its support of the guerrillas.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 66 - 67) As of September 26, 1962 {{a survey}} conducted by the Federal Reserve System showed that there was a total of nearly 11 billion dollars represented by 750, 000 loans, which were made to borrowers other than brokers, dealers, or bankers and which were collateralized either wholly or partly by securities. This represents just under one-tenth of all loans which were outstanding at the member banks as of the survey date. This study seeks to determine how well documented are the policies used to determine whether <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> or reject <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of this type and to what degree these policies limit the amount of decision making to be exercised by the loan officer handling the loan. Eight criteria were selected for the study. These criteria were (1) loan territory, 2) margin requirement, 3) interest rate, (4) length of loan. (5) ratio of amount of loan to annual income, (6) purpose of loan, (7) compensating balances, (8) amount of loan. The study consisted of two basic parts. The first part of the study consisted of personal interviews with bank lending officers in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles County, to determine how the above criteria were stated in their bank. The second part of the study consisted of a survey of the opinions of leading banking executives throughout the country on the same criteria. An analysis of both parts of the study indicated that the criteria are for the most part well documented and flexible in nature allowing a relatively high degree of decision making {{on the part of the}} loan officer...|$|R
