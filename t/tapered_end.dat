25|$|Although the {{direction}} of reading has been determined, {{the point where the}} text starts has not. Philippi's line numbers were arbitrary, but kept by Barthel. The main asymmetry is that line 12 (Fischer's line 1) is 90cm long, running three quarters the length of the Staff. The space occupied by lines 12 and 13 is 30mm wide at the thick end of the staff (at the end of line 12 and beginning of line 13), but only 17mm wide at the <b>tapered</b> <b>end</b> (at the end of line 13). Past the cut-off point (the beginning) of line 12, the baseline of line 13 shifts upward, and the glyphs widen to fill in the gap. From that point on, 13 is parallel with line 11 rather than antiparallel as is normally the case for adjacent lines.|$|E
2500|$|... "Through-holed and wedged" [...] {{is one of}} {{the primary}} means of joining Windsor chair parts. A {{cylindrical}} or slightly tapered hole is bored in the first piece, the matching cylindrical or <b>tapered</b> <b>end</b> of the second piece is inserted in the hole as a round tenon, and a wedge is driven into the end of this tenon, flaring it tight in the hole. The excess portion of the wedge is then cut flush with the surface. This supplies a mechanical hold that will prevail when the glue fails. In general, early Windsor chair joints are held together mechanically, making glue a redundant detail in their assembly.|$|E
2500|$|A {{knitting}} needle or knitting pin {{is a tool}} in hand-knitting to produce knitted fabrics. [...] They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, {{but they are not}} nearly as sharp as sewing needles. [...] Their purpose is two-fold. [...] The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the <b>tapered</b> <b>end</b> through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E

2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. [...] The darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the <b>tapered</b> <b>end</b> of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E

40|$|Micro {{thruster}} is {{the power}} plant of mini-spacecraft. It enables the mini-spacecraft to realize orbit adjustment, station keeping and attitude controlling. Micro nozzle is one of key parts of the micro thruster. The surface roughness of its inner surface significantly influences the thrust performance of the thruster. In this paper, a residual surface model is developed for micro-nozzle obtained by micro machining using a ball end mill and a <b>taper</b> <b>end</b> mill. The residual surface model is then used to investigate {{the relationship between the}} surface quality and nozzle thrust performance in nozzle flow field. A thrust measuring apparatus is designed and manufactured to inspect the thrust performance of the machined micro nozzles. Both simulation and experiment results indicate that good machined surface quality is obtained with <b>taper</b> <b>end</b> mill. The nozzle machined with the <b>taper</b> <b>end</b> mill has better thrust performance than that with the ball end mill under the same inlet pressure...|$|R

50|$|Weight and {{strength}} are clearly essential for success, but technique {{is also important}} for balancing the caber when lifting it, and flipping up the held (<b>tapered)</b> <b>end</b> to promote a clean toss.|$|E
50|$|The tosser {{balances}} the caber upright, <b>tapered</b> <b>end</b> downwards, against {{his or her}} shoulder and neck; the caber being supported by stewards or fellow-competitors while being placed into position. The tosser then crouches, sliding his interlocked hands down the caber and under the rounded base, and lifts it in his cupped hands. While standing he must balance the caber upright - not an easy victory with the heavier end at the top, and less-experienced tossers {{may be unable to}} stop the caber falling to one side after lifting it. The tosser then walks or runs a few paces forward to gain momentum, and flips the <b>tapered</b> <b>end</b> upwards so that the large end hits the ground first and - if well tossed - the caber falls directly away from the tosser.|$|E
25|$|Meigle 25 is a hogback {{tombstone}} {{dating to}} the late 10th century. The sides of the monument are decorated with carved rooftiles and the ridge of the recumbent stone is sculpted with a fishtailed beast. The stone <b>tapers</b> at one <b>end,</b> and {{the sides of the}} monument together with this <b>tapering</b> <b>end</b> are sculpted with concave-sided roof-tiles. The stone demonstrates stylistic affinities with early hogback stones from the Glasgow area. The ridge of the stone is carved with an elongated beast with its head at the higher end of the monument, the beast has the tail of a fish at the <b>tapering</b> <b>end</b> if the stone. The creature's head is similar to the heads of animals on Meigle 1 and Meigle 5.|$|R

50|$|Normally a güira {{consists}} of an open-ended tube with many sound-producing nodules protruding its outer (usual) playing surface. The body of the güira is generally some type of thin sheet steel. One commercial variant commonly called a torpedo is fully enclosed with <b>tapered</b> <b>ends</b> and is supplied with mineral or glass beads or metal shot inside to double as a shaker. Given its unwieldy shape and the additional weight of <b>tapered</b> <b>ends</b> and shaker fill, using a güira as a shaker may be impractical. Regardless of how it is used, its traditional main function is to propel the tempo, not only to add its uniquely swishy metallic timbre's sabor ("flavor").|$|R

50|$|Scour {{marks and}} flute casts are scours dug into soft, fine {{sediment}} which typically get filled by an overlying bed (hence the name cast).
