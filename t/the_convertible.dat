5|$|The 757-200M, a {{convertible}} version {{capable of carrying}} cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200 Combi, the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door {{in the manner of}} the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included <b>the</b> <b>convertible</b> model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>convertible</b> {{featured}} a removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching {{over to the}} right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with <b>the</b> <b>convertible</b> the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. <b>The</b> <b>convertible</b> also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. <b>The</b> <b>convertible</b> assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E
25|$|Several car {{magazines}} at {{the time}} lauded <b>the</b> <b>convertible.</b> Production ceasing in 1991 after Mazda marketed a limited run of 500 example for 1992 for the domestic market only. In Japan, the United Kingdom, and other regions outside the US, a turbocharged version of <b>the</b> <b>convertible</b> was available.|$|E
50|$|A factory <b>convertible</b> entered <b>the</b> model range. However, the Baur {{remained}} on sale, alongside <b>the</b> factory <b>convertible.</b> <b>The</b> M3 <b>convertible</b> was only offered for the European market.|$|R

25|$|The updated Hornet Brougham <b>convertible,</b> <b>the</b> sole <b>convertible</b> {{available}} from Hudson, was attractive but overpriced at US$3,288 for a six-cylinder car in 1954.|$|R
50|$|For the 2008 model year, <b>the</b> Sebring <b>convertible</b> was {{redesigned}} with styling cues {{such as the}} hood's strake lines {{recalling the}} Chrysler Crossfire. <b>The</b> new <b>convertible</b> body style debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles International Auto Show as an early-2008 model. It was the bestselling four-place open-top cars in the United States, trailing only <b>the</b> Ford Mustang <b>convertible.</b>|$|R
50|$|Saab {{manufactured}} various models at the Valmet Automotive {{plant in}} Uusikaupunki, Finland, between 1969 and 2003, {{in a joint}} venture established in 1968 together with Valmet. After 2003 Saab did not manufacture any cars in Finland, as the production of <b>the</b> 9-3 <b>convertible</b> then moved to Graz, Austria. In 2010 production of <b>the</b> 9-3 <b>convertible</b> was moved again to Trollhättan. This {{marked the first time}} that Trollhättan manufactured <b>the</b> 9-3 <b>convertible.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>convertible</b> roof {{is fully}} {{automatic}} — an unusual feature {{in such a}} small car — and can be opened partially {{to act as a}} sunroof whilst the car is driving at speed. <b>The</b> <b>convertible</b> model forsakes the rear hatchback of the Hardtop Mini, replacing it with a drop down 'tailgate' that is reminiscent of the classic Mini — it incorporates similarly prominent external hinges, and with the roof in the closed position, the rear roof section and luggage shelf can be raised with two handles, semi-tailgate style, to access the luggage space easier. <b>The</b> <b>convertible</b> also adds two small power windows for the rear seat passengers which are lowered automatically when the roof opens. The roof is made from a heavy cloth, with many layers of insulation; the rear window is glass with an integral heater/defroster, but no washer or wiper.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>convertibles</b> were a {{far more}} {{involved}} project. This required the redesigning of the car's unit construction and the fabrication of a replacement rear deck lid, floor reinforcements, quarter panel caps, tonneau cover and a windshield that was raked back an extra 10 degrees. They received a manual convertible top that took up residence in the area once designated for the rear seats. <b>The</b> ASC McLaren <b>convertibles</b> use a smaller top than <b>the</b> Mustang <b>convertible</b> that is unique to that car, as are the seals, weatherstripping, windshield moldings, etcetera. Only 557 convertibles were built during its 1984-1986 production run.|$|R
25|$|Tax advantages. The {{market for}} {{convertibles}} is primarily pitched towards the non taxpaying investor. The price will substantially reflect (1) {{the value of}} the underlying shares, (2) the discounted gross income advantage of <b>the</b> <b>convertible</b> over the underlying shares, plus (3) some figure for the embedded optionality of the bond. The tax advantage is greatest with mandatory convertibles. Effectively a high tax-paying shareholder can benefit from the company securitising gross future income on <b>the</b> <b>convertible,</b> income which it can offset against taxable profits.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} remains {{faithful to}} the marine-nautical theme of the 100EX. <b>The</b> 2-door 4-seat <b>convertible</b> features rearward opening coach doors and a two-tone colour scheme that delineates between {{the upper and lower}} bodywork and frames the teak wood panelling of <b>the</b> <b>convertible's</b> tonneau cover. Unlike the 2004 concept car, however, the production unit eschews the EX's aluminium bonnet in favour of more easily maintained stainless steel.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> fixed-profile <b>convertible</b> {{variant of}} <b>the</b> 500 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2009 {{designated}} the 500C (C for Cabrio), historically recalling <b>the</b> fixed-profile <b>convertible</b> of <b>the</b> original 1957 Fiat 500 [...] - [...] {{as well as}} similar fixed-profile <b>convertibles</b> such as <b>the</b> Citroën DS 3 (2013), Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948-1990) and <b>the</b> Nash Rambler <b>Convertible</b> [...] "Landau" [...] Coupe (1950).|$|R

As {{a result of this}} design, the trunks of convertible models were notorious for leaking.|$|E
50|$|Due to its lighter {{weight and}} {{improved}} aerodynamics <b>the</b> Firebird <b>Convertible</b> was finally available through GM's normal ordering procedures. ASC still converted T-top cars into <b>convertibles</b> but <b>the</b> ordering process was simplified and dealers {{would no longer}} need to have the cars drop shipped to ASC in Michigan. <b>The</b> <b>Convertibles</b> were offered with one of three engine options: LHO 3.1L V6, the L03 5.0L V8 for the base Firebird, or the LB9 5.0L V8 Trans Am only.|$|R

2500|$|North America: About 50% of <b>the</b> global <b>convertible</b> market, {{mostly from}} the USA (even if Canada is well {{represented}} in the Material sector). This market is more standardised than <b>the</b> others with <b>convertible</b> structures being relatively uniform (e.g. Standard Make-Whole take over features, Contingent Conversion @ 130%). Regarding the trading, <b>the</b> American <b>convertible</b> market is [...] "centralised" [...] around TRACE which helps in terms of price transparency.

Most of the trading operation are based in New-York.|$|R

25|$|Yield: Yield of <b>the</b> <b>convertible</b> bond at the {{issuance}} date, could {{be different from}} the coupon value if the bond is offering a premium redemption. In those cases the yield value would determine the premium redemption value and intermediary put redemption value.|$|E
50|$|Like its coupe and {{liftback}} siblings, <b>the</b> American GT <b>convertible</b> is ST204 with 5S-FE engine, while <b>the</b> Japanese <b>convertible,</b> and European GT cabriolet are the 3S-GE powered ST202.
