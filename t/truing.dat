50|$|In {{grinding}}, {{the wheel}} follows a simple path. For example, in plunge grinding a shaft, the wheel moves in towards {{the axis of}} the part, grinds it, and then moves back out. Since each slice of the wheel repeatedly contacts the same slice of the workpiece, any inaccuracies in the geometric shape of the grinding wheel will be transferred onto the part. Therefore, {{the accuracy of the}} finished workpiece geometry is limited to the accuracy of the <b>truing</b> dresser. The accuracy becomes even worse as the grind wheel wears, so <b>truing</b> must occur periodically to reshape it.|$|E

5000|$|A wheel <b>truing</b> {{stand is}} a {{specialized}} tool for [...] "truing" [...] (straightening) bicycle wheels. Individual models differ slightly, but all consist of an axle stand {{on which the}} wheel can rotate and calipers, to measure slight deviations of the wheel's rim from ideal alignment. The stand is {{used in conjunction with}} an appropriately sized spoke wrench to loosen or tighten the spokes that connect the wheel's hub to the rim.|$|E
5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the grinding tool and several <b>truing</b> steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. Grinding tool alignment, grinding tool referencing and grinding tool <b>truing</b> also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{diamond plate}} is a steel plate, {{sometimes}} {{mounted on a}} plastic or resin base, coated with diamond grit, an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones. [...] The plate may {{have a series of}} holes cut in it that capture the swarf cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. <b>Truing</b> (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a diamond plate to wear away is a very thin coating of grit and adhesive, and in a good diamond plate this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a diamond plate retains its flatness. Rubbing the diamond plate on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional <b>truing</b> methods.|$|E
60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it is granted that its premisses are <b>true</b> in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also be <b>true.</b> But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known that if this is <b>true,</b> then that is <b>true.</b> Suppose it also known that this is <b>true,</b> then it follows that that is true.' When it is the case that if this is <b>true,</b> that is <b>true,</b> we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and this is <b>true,</b> then that is <b>true.</b> In other words, 'anything implied by a <b>true</b> proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a <b>true</b> proposition is true'.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras and prove the completeness of the very <b>true</b> MTL-logic. In this paper, the concept of very <b>true</b> operators on MTL-algebras is introduced and some related properties are investigated. Also, conditions for an MTL-algebra to be an MV-algebra and a Gödel algebra are given via this operator. Moreover, very <b>true</b> filters on very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras are studied. In particular, subdirectly irreducible very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras are characterized and an analogous of representation theorem for very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras is proved. Then, the left and right stabilizers of very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras are introduced and some related properties are given. As applications of stabilizer of very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras, we produce a basis for a topology on very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras and show that the generated topology by this basis is Baire, connected, locally connected and separable. Finally, the corresponding logic very <b>true</b> MTL-logic is constructed and the soundness and completeness of this logic are proved based on very <b>true</b> MTL-algebras...|$|R
