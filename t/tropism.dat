5|$|The term viral <b>tropism</b> {{refers to}} the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is {{mediated}} through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} <b>tropism</b> of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue <b>tropism</b> is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tropisms</b> are growth {{responses}} {{of plants that}} result in curvatures of plant organs toward or away from certain stimuli. <b>Tropisms</b> can be positive, {{in which case the}} plant will bend toward a stimulus, or negative, in which case the plant will bend away from a stimulus.

5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both, X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral <b>tropism,</b> as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tropisms</b> {{in plants}} {{are the result}} of {{differential}} cell growth, in which the cells {{on one side of the}} plant elongates more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth. Among the common <b>tropisms</b> seen in plants is phototropism, the bending of the plant toward a source of light. Phototropism allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. Geotropism allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards. <b>Tropisms</b> generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones.|$|R

25|$|Although AAV2 is {{the most}} popular {{serotype}} in various AAV-based research, {{it has been shown that}} other serotypes can be more effective as gene delivery vectors. For instance AAV6 appears much better in infecting airway epithelial cells, AAV7 presents very high transduction rate of murine skeletal muscle cells (similarly to AAV1 and AAV5), AAV8 is superb in transducing hepatocytes and AAV1 and 5 were shown to be very efficient in gene delivery to vascular endothelial cells. In the brain, most AAV serotypes show neuronal <b>tropism,</b> while AAV5 also transduces astrocytes. AAV6, a hybrid of AAV1 and AAV2, also shows lower immunogenicity than AAV2.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tropisms</b> are growth-mediated plant {{movements}} that help plants {{to respond to}} changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, {{as well as the}} presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (<b>tropisms).</b> The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight experiments done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two <b>tropisms</b> through experiments carried out {{in the absence of a}} significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i. e. the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the unknown mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in <b>tropisms</b> and the cell cycle...|$|R
25|$|Until the 1990s, {{virtually}} all AAV biology was studied using AAV serotype 2. However, AAV is highly prevalent in humans and other primates and several serotypes have been isolated from various tissue samples. Serotypes 2, 3, 5, and 6 {{were discovered in}} human cells, AAV serotypes 1, 4, and 7–11 in nonhuman primate samples. As of 2006 there have been 11 AAV serotypes described, the 11th in 2004. AAV capsid proteins contain 12 hypervariable surface regions, with most variability occurring in the threefold proximal peaks, but the parvovirus genome in general presents highly conserved replication and structural genes across serotypes. All of the known serotypes can infect cells from multiple diverse tissue types. Tissue specificity {{is determined by the}} capsid serotype and pseudotyping of AAV vectors to alter their <b>tropism</b> range will likely be important to their use in therapy.|$|E
500|$|Vermigli is {{best known}} for his polemics against the Catholic {{doctrine}} of transubstantiation and for the Reformed doctrine of [...] "sacramental presence". He argued that transubstantiation, the belief that the substance of bread and wine are changed into Christ's body and blood, was not based on any argument from scripture. He also argued on the basis of Chalcedonian Christology, that because Christ retained his divine nature when he became man (the divine nature was added to the human nature rather than his human nature being made divine), the substance of the bread and wine remain the same rather than being changed into the substance of Christ's body and blood. Finally, he used the analogy of the believer's union with Christ against the idea of transubstantiation. Because the believer retains their human nature even though God has joined them with Christ, it follows that the Eucharistic elements do not need to be transformed to be Christ's body. Instead of the substance of the elements changing into Christ's flesh, Vermigli emphasized the action of the sacrament as an instrument through which Christ is offered to the partaker. He also disagreed with the Anabaptist belief that the Eucharist is simply symbolic or figurative, a view called memorialism or <b>tropism.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Plants {{may respond}} both to {{directional}} and non-directional stimuli. [...] A {{response to a}} directional stimulus, such as gravity or sunlight, is called a <b>tropism.</b> [...] A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as temperature or humidity, is a nastic movement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason that}} {{different}} routes of administration lead to different cell types being transfected (e.g., different <b>tropism)</b> {{is that the}} [...] inner limiting membrane (ILM) and the various retinal layers act as physical barriers for the delivery of drugs and vectors to the deeper retinal layers.

2500|$|Entry inhibitors (or fusion inhibitors) {{interfere}} with binding, fusion and entry of HIV-1 {{to the host}} cell by blocking one of several targets. [...] Maraviroc and enfuvirtide are the two currently available agents in this class. [...] Maraviroc works by targeting CCR5, a co-receptor located on human helper T-cells. Caution should be used when administering this drug however due to a possible shift in <b>tropism</b> which allows HIV to target an alternative co-receptor such as CXCR4. [...] In rare cases, individuals may have a mutation in the CCR5 delta gene which results in a nonfunctional CCR5 co-receptor and in turn, a means of resistance or slow progression of the disease. [...] However, as mentioned previously, this can be overcome if an HIV variant that targets CXCR4 becomes dominant. [...] To prevent fusion of the virus with the host membrane, enfuvirtide can be used. [...] Enfuvirtide is a peptide drug that must be injected and acts by interacting with the N-terminal heptad repeat of gp41 of HIV to form an inactive hetero six-helix bundle, therefore preventing infection of host cells.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tropisms</b> {{occur in}} four {{sequential}} steps. First, {{there is a}} perception to a stimulus, which is usually beneficiary to the plant. Next, signal transduction occurs. This leads to auxin redistribution at the cellular level and finally, the growth response occurs.|$|R
