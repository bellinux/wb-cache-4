5|$|Sesame Street {{international}} co-productions are educational children's {{television series}} {{based on the}} American Sesame Street but tailored to <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> which they are produced.

5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>in</b> which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
