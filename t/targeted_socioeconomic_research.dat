40|$|The {{published}} research {{plans of the}} US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) have each been criticized by the Office of Technology Assessment for focusing largely {{on the development of}} technological “hardware” and giving little attention to <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> (broadly defined). This paper first examines <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> areas that EPA might be expected to cover and shows that its plans for doing so are inadequate. The paper then identifies gaps in ERDA 2 ̆ 7 s coverage of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> that remain unfilled even in the agency 2 ̆ 7 s updated plan. Several reasons for this neglect of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> are hypothesized, namely: the dominance of research management by scientists and technologists; the apparent irrelevance and/or lack of success of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> performed in the past; the greater political acceptability of technological compared with non-technological approaches to pollution control: the public 2 ̆ 7 s apparent faith in our ability to develop technological solutions to energy and environmental problems; and the compatibility of new technology development with economic growth. Following a discussion of these reasons, it is concluded that senior management positions in both agencies must no longer be monopolized by those with solely scientific and technical backgrounds; instead, managers should be appointed who not only have appropriate social science or professional qualifications but are also able to communicate to their colleagues, to lawmakers, and to the public at large, the importance of having a balanced research program with both technological and socioeconomic components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fourteen {{years after}} the birth of the journal Agroji~resrry Sysrems, biophysical studies {{continue}} to dominate agroforestry research while other important areas have not received the attention they deserve. This paper reviews the progress in one of these under-researched areas, socioeconomics. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of published <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> papers and a survey of agroforestry socioeconomic researchers are used to evaluate the achievements in agroforestry <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> over the past 14 years: what are the major advances, gaps in knowledge, and constraints for closing those knowledge gaps? Although agroforestry socioeconomics remains a field in its infancy, both the scope and the quality of <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> are slowly improving. The recent trend away from literature reviews, qualitative, and purely descriptive quantitative research based on small sample sizes, and toward more rigorous statistical analyses of better and larger data sets is encouraging. Priority areas for future research include theoretical and empirical analyses of agroforestry adoption decisions, improved economic analyses, and policy studies at local, national, and regional levels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Environmental {{issues and}} risk have become central in <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> and policy {{planning}} {{in order to}} ensure sustainable development. As environmental risk is difficult to assess and measure, different indexes have been developed to evaluate specific aspects of such risk. Environmental risk typically involves problems generated by the consumption of energy (fuels), water shortages, disasters, global warming, poverty, and population growth. Environmental indexes are typically disaggregated and deal with separate aspects of environmental risk. Some useful overall indexes exist, such as the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI).

40|$|Draft {{report of}} the 5 th meeting of TAC, held in Rome from January 30 to February 2, 1973, TAC Chairman Sir John Crawford presiding. The meeting was devoted {{primarily}} to a preliminary discussion of priorities for international agricultural research. Crawford said he was looking not for hard and fast priorities, but for a framework within which TAC could make specific decisions. He mentioned potential expenditures of $ 70 - 80 million {{by the end of}} the decade. There was agreement on giving first priority to food production while also considering food quality, particularly protein. To introduce a separate discussion of priorities in <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research,</b> economists from CIAT, CIMMYT, IRRI, and FAO made presentations. TAC considered the social and policy implications of introducing new technological packages, translation of field level research results into public policy, and whether <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>research</b> warranted establishment of its own IARC. Sir John said that TAC would consider the subject further following a seminar being organized by USAID at Centers Week in July. Having heard revised proposals from WARDA, TAC decided it needed still further information before making a decision on CGIAR support. It decided to supplement a report on water management by Dean Peterson by seeking information from the centers about their programs. TAC received a USAID proposal to establish a resource base on soybeans at the University of Illinois; it approved a resolution establishing a standing subcommittee on grain protein, and discussed a progress report by its Sub-Committee on Research Needs for Protein in Tropical America. TAC made detailed comments on the report of a task force commissioned by the CGIAR sub-Committee on African Livestock and endorsed the proposed creation of a multidisciplinary African livestock production systems center, initially separate from ILRAD.
