5|$|Gymnopils maritimus {{is clearly}} a {{different}} species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings materialized {{following}} a brief hiatus by Howling Bells, whereupon {{the band members}} worked on other projects. Additionally, Juanita became a first-time mother after giving birth. This, along with frustration from the long period of inactivity and creation inspired her and she started to write songs again, at which point she got <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band involved. They made demos and sent them out to prospective producers, one being Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins). Moulder was busy at the time so he recommended that the band contact an assistant of his, Catherine J. Marks (Foals, The Killers), who after meeting, Howling Bells chose to produce the album.|$|E

5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus.|$|E

The entire area was fenced off, and remaining houses on the mountain were purchased by the Nazi Party and demolished.
