40|$|Content {{processing}} is a {{vast and}} growing field that integrates different approaches borrowed from the signal processing, information retrieval and machine learning disciplines. In this article we deal with {{a particular type of}} content processing: the so-called content-based transformations. We will not focus on any particular application but rather try to give an overview of different techniques and conceptual implications. We first describe the transformation process itself, including the main model schemes that are commonly used, which lead to the establishment of the formal basis for a definition of content-based transformations. Then we take a quick look at a general spectral based analysis/synthesis approach to process audio signals and how to extract features {{that can be used in}} the content-based transformation context. Using this analysis/synthesis approach we give some examples on how content-based transformations can be applied to modify the basic perceptual axis of a sound and how we can even combine different basic effects in order to perform more meaningful <b>transformations.</b> We <b>finish</b> <b>by</b> going a step further in the abstraction ladder and present transformations that are related to musical (and thus symbolic) properties rather than to those of the sound or the signal itself...|$|R
40|$|Mouse embryo {{cells with}} a {{targeted}} {{disruption of the}} insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) genes (R- cells) are refractory to <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> the simian virus 40 large T antigen and/or an activated and overexpressed Ras, both of which readily transform cells from wild-type littermate embryos and other 3 T 3 -like cells. R- cells are also refractory to <b>transformation</b> induced <b>by</b> overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta. Since the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta is required for <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> bovine papillomavirus, we inquired whether the IGF-IR was also required for <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> bovine papillomavirus E 5 oncoprotein. We show here that R- cells are refractory to <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> E 5; reintroduction into R- cells of a human IGF-IR restores the susceptibility to transformation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTissue-specific factors {{influence}} whether {{cells are}} susceptible to <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> erbB oncogenes. Avian fibroblasts resist <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> insertionally activated c-erbB (IAc-erbB), whereas erythroblasts are transformed by this mutant of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In studies presented here, NIH/ 3 T 3 cells resisted <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> IAc-erbB. This finding indicates that the nonpermissiveness of fibroblasts is conserved between avian and murine species. Surprisingly, expression of IAc-erbB blocked <b>transformation</b> <b>by</b> a v-erbB allele. The trans-dominant interference by IAc-erbB occurred despite expression at levels lower than for v-erbB. Together with previous reports, {{the results indicate that}} IAc-erbB can exert opposite growth effects in different tissues. The switch from positive to negative growth regulation, which depends on the cellular context, provides novel insight into tissue-specific regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Evasion of cell-specific inhibition apparently contributes to the distinct tissue tropisms of various erbB mutants...|$|R
