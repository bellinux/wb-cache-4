25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E
500|$|If {{trustees}} {{wished to}} invest in [...] "wide range" [...] investments, {{they were required to}} have <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> valued and divided into two parts– three quarters of the value in one part, and a quarter in the other. The quarter was to be invested in [...] "wide range" [...] investments, while the remainder was restricted to [...] "narrow range" [...] investments. The valuation had to be done by [...] "a person reasonably believed by the trustee to be qualified to make it". This division of funds was permanent, and the quarter and three quarters became distinct units. The permanence of the division was the Act's most controversial section.|$|E
500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This is {{that where}} trust funds are wrongly mixed with the trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the amounts owed to them, or whether to take the unauthorised investment as part of <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund.</b> This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The primary rule in regard to a mixed fund, therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is {{an exception to the}} primary rule, exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the wrongdoer and those claiming through him".|$|E

50|$|Since {{recommendations}} of the Greenspan Commission were adopted in the early 1980s, Social Security payroll taxes have exceeded benefit payments. In FY2008, Social Security received $180 billion more in payroll taxes and accrued interest than it paid out in benefits.
