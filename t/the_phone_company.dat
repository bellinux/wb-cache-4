5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

That day the storm became extratropical, yet still had negative effects on Canada. In Carbonear a boy broke his leg after being blown into a car and thousands of dollars in damage, as well as broken polls, uprooted trees, interrupted telephone service, damaged chimneys and power outages were reported in St. John's, Canada. There were also reports of roof damage and a trailer being torn for its foundation.

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the phone at cost, give it to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company,</b> then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.|$|E

During the marriage, they had five children {{and the house was}} filled with love, laughter, music, books and words. Both loved jazz music and Rosalie joked that Jim married her to get access to her collection of jazz recordings. Over time, her interest in the folk music of her childhood was piqued and she began to study at the University of Utah with noted folklorist, Wayland Hand. She learned to accompany herself on guitar during this period and attended folklore society meetings and seminars.|$|E

25|$|They {{continued}} to fight {{even as the}} American press trumpeted the rapid crumbling of German resistance. The regiment helped to capture the Ruhr Pocket, where thousands of German troops and hundreds of German vehicles were captured. The unit crossed the Altmuhl River on 25 April, the Danube River on 27 April, and the Isar River on 30 April. There Major Butler collapsed due to exhaustion on 30 April, and Lt. Col. J. A. Gallagher assumed command {{for the last few}} days of the war. When hostilities ceased on 7 May 1945, the regiment had during six months of fighting experienced 300 percent turnover due to casualties. The regiment assumed occupation duties in Hammelburg and Bad Bruckenau until it was shipped home in the summer of 1945. Lt. Col.

500|$|Bret buys a new cup for $2.79 {{so that he}} and Jemaine {{no longer}} have to share one cup. A month later, they find out that their check for the phone bill bounced because their account was short $2.79. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> charges them a $30 {{overdraft}} fee, causing the cheque for their gas bill to bounce, and both services are scheduled to be cut off. Immediately after finding this out, their power goes off. Bret ends up selling his guitar to pay the bills, and he performs on stage with Jemaine while playing air guitar and making guitar sounds. Murray writes up his negative opinion of the show in the New Zealand consulate newsletter, giving them [...] "two stars out of 100". When Bret asks Murray for some of the emergency band fund, Murray tells him that he invested the money with a Nigerian man named Nigel Seladu who contacted him over the internet. Nigel promised Murray his money back with [...] "a thousand percent interest" [...] and [...] "a share of his family fortunes". Jemaine and Bret are certain that this is merely a scam.|$|E
2500|$|The {{device was}} {{the topic of}} a {{landmark}} court case, Hush-A-Phone v. United States.

Indeed, because Hush-A-Phone eventually won its case against <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company,</b> the final legal proceedings involving the Hush-A-Phone turned out to be relevant to the eventual breakup of the Bell system.|$|E

2500|$|On December 27, 2009, reports {{began to}} surface that AT had {{suspended}} online {{sales of the}} iPhone. Spokesman Fletcher Cook said that <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> periodically [...] "modifies" [...] its distribution channels, but had no further comment on the suspension of sales in the New York City area. One AT employee incorrectly stated that, [...] "New York wasn't ready for the iPhone," [...] and that it lacked {{a sufficient number of}} cell towers to meet the heavy data demands imposed upon the network by iPhone users. Sales of the popular iPhone resumed December 30, 2009. This incident has revived speculation that AT's wireless network is not up {{to the demands of the}} current generation of 3G smartphones. The official AT statement is that a large amount of fraudulent activity caused the withdrawal of sales in the area.|$|E
2500|$|After the Henderson Home was {{transferred}} to its new Homestead location in 1969 it was then renovated and converted to a telephone museum, with exhibits of early telephone and switchboard technology stretching back to the 1880s. The museum's exhibits were developed in cooperation with Bell Canada, the Canadian successor to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> established by Melville with Reverend Henderson's assistance, after Alexander Graham gave his father [...] 75% of the Canadian patent rights to the invention. The exhibits included {{a model of the}} nation's first telephone factory, a three-story building established by some of Bell's friends in Brantford, Thomas Cowherd and his son James. Other artifacts included telephone components, an original 'telephone exchange' or switchboard, and early model telephones leading up to the Contempra telephone produced by Bell Canada's affiliate equipment manufacturer, Nortel. In 1973 Bell Canada also later offered an [...] "extensive and valuable" [...] collection of telephone and telecommunications equipment on permanent loan for display in the museum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry has gravitated to Omaha {{over the last}} 30 years. After the U.S. government relocated the Strategic Air Command here after World War II the city became {{home to one of}} the world's most advanced and secure phone systems. Other factors in the city's success include Omaha's location in the Central Time Zone, making it more convenient to call either coast during the work day, as well as local speech patterns, described as [...] "pure American," [...] making it easily understood everywhere. Nebraska state regulators granted local phone companies wide latitude to deploy new services rapidly, and Omaha's Metropolitan Community College created telecommunications-related courses and training programs. Since the early 1980s a number of large hotel and travel reservation operations, including those for Marriott, Hyatt, Radisson and Westin hotels, as well as the traffic information center for Greyhound Bus Lines have all been located in the city. After the AT breakup, US West, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company</b> whose 14-state territory includes Nebraska, adopted the slogan [...] "Dial 800 and get Omaha" [...] to promote its services. Worldwide telecommunications company West Corporation was founded in Omaha in 1986 and is currently still headquartered there. Other nationwide companies with major call center operations located in Omaha include Paypal, Cox Communications, and Aflac.|$|E

2500|$|Fonda {{was brought}} up as a Christian Scientist, though he was baptized an Episcopalian at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Grand Island. [...] He said, [...] "My whole damn family was nice." [...] They were a close family and highly supportive, {{especially}} in health matters, as they avoided doctors due to their religion. Despite having a religious background, he later became an agnostic. Fonda was a bashful, short boy who tended to avoid girls, except his sisters, and was a good skater, swimmer, and runner. He worked part-time in his father's print plant and imagined a possible career as a journalist. Later, he worked after school for <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>company.</b> He also enjoyed drawing. Fonda {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts of America; Teichmann reports that he reached the rank of Eagle Scout. However, this is denied elsewhere. When he was about 14, his father took him to observe the lynching of a young black man accused of rape.
