5|$|The Town of Christchurch {{by-election}} in 1860 {{was triggered}} by the resignation of Richard Packer as the Member of the House of Representatives for the Town of Christchurch electorate, and occurred during the term of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. The previous representative of the electorate, the politician Henry Sewell, had returned after three years in England and the general expectation was that Sewell would be the sole contender for election. The Lyttelton Times wrote several provocative editorials, generally endorsing Sewell for his obvious ability, but criticising him for not publicly <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> policies and plans. Sewell eventually arranged a public meeting the evening prior to nomination day; {{this was the only}} public meeting during the election campaign. After a lengthy address, which was favourably received by the Lyttelton Times, a second contender for the office put his name forward at that meeting: the publican Michael Hart. Sewell, a former premier and one of New Zealand's most senior politicians at the time, was successful against the political novice Hart.|$|E

He was shy and did not seek the company of others, but received company courteously and enjoyed telling stories or <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> art. He gained a reputation as a loner, but he maintained social contacts, enjoyed writing letters, and continued to travel on occasion to visit friends.|$|E
