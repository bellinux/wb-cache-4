5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} of {{hearings}} into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by <b>the</b> <b>vendor.</b> Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{criticism}} {{is focused on the}} lack of disclosure of the money received from <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> it rates, raising conflict of interest issues. Also a source of criticism is the lack of disclosure on <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> component scores and the lack of transparency in Gartner's methodology used to derive <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> position on <b>the</b> MQ map.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Data was {{collected}} from food vendors {{in a poor}} resource community in Ghana, which showed that <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> constituted {{an important source of}} oro-faecal transmission. Following this, the WHO five keys of safer food were utilized in an evidence based training programme for <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> to improve their food handling practices. Impact assessment of the food safety training showed that 67. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> had acquired some knowledge from the workshop and were putting it into practice. Lack of food safety equipment was a major hinderance to behavioral change among <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> as far food handling practices are concerned...|$|R
5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, <b>The</b> <b>Vendor</b> of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a Hotelling spatial competition model, {{in which two}} vendors simultaneously decide, firstly, on location, and, secondly, on price. We assume quadratic transportation costs, so that <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> would locate at maximum distance in equilibrium. However, we introduce a counter-acting behavioural/psychological/emotional 'attraction' factor that 'confuses' <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> and pulls them together. We examine the combined effects of economic price-softening driving <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> apart, versus behavioural attraction, on the vendors' location decision...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>vendor's</b> letter {{requesting}} {{electronic transfer}} and delaying {{what was to}} be a concurrent surrender of the title documents until notification of the receipt of the funds was made by the purchaser was to <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> advantage. Performance of the deed requested constituted acceptance by the purchaser that he was waiving his right to have <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> strict contractual obligation performed. It did not import a further obligation on the purchaser regarding the method of settlement.|$|R

As the pro-dater is eager to date again, the next date is immediately set up with the next wealthy foreigner.|$|R
25|$|Covered {{entities}} that out-source {{some of their}} business processes to a third party must ensure that their vendors also have a framework in place to comply with HIPAA requirements. Companies typically gain this assurance through clauses in the contracts stating that <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> will meet the same data protection requirements that apply to the covered entity. Care {{must be taken to}} determine if <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> further out-sources any data handling functions to other vendors and monitor whether appropriate contracts and controls are in place.|$|E
25|$|By storing {{all this}} {{information}} <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> can determine the customer needs very precisely whenever a customer requests a product or an update. As already stated <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> can also easily inform the customer about some adaptations the customer needs to make to its configuration in order to let the product function properly. Another advantage of storing this information in a system {{is that it will}} ease the process of online delivery. The checking of the configuration needs and constraints can all be done automatically when a customer does a request.|$|E

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> {{is aware}} of the {{customer}} request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the configuration management system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.|$|E
25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendorâ€™s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases it is possible that <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback {{can be found in the}} CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E
25|$|This {{may require}} {{professional}} project management and several iterations {{in the planning}} process with <b>the</b> <b>vendor</b> of the imaging system, as technical interdependencies are complex.

50|$|Alternatively, <b>the</b> {{software}} <b>vendor</b> sends <b>the</b> user {{a unique}} product serial number. When the user installs the application it requests that the user enter their product serial number, and checks it with <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> systems over <b>the</b> Internet. The application obtains the license limits {{that apply to}} that user's license, such as a time limit or enabling of product features, from <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> system and optionally also locks the license to the user's system. Once activated the license continues working on the user's machine with no further communication required with <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> systems. Some activation systems also support activation on user systems without Internet connections; a common approach is to exchange encrypted files at an Internet terminal.|$|R
50|$|GDS is {{different}} from a computer reservations system, which is a reservation system used by the service providers (also known as vendors). Primary customers of GDS are travel agents (both online and office-based) to make reservation on various reservation systems run by <b>the</b> <b>vendors.</b> GDS holds no inventory; the inventory is held on <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> reservation system itself. A GDS system will have real-time link to <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> database. For example, when a travel agency requests a reservation on {{the service of a}} particular airline company, the GDS system routes the request to the appropriate airline's computer reservations system. This enables a travel agent with a connection to a single GDS to choose and book various flights, hotels, activities and associated services on all <b>the</b> <b>vendors</b> operating in <b>the</b> same route who are part of that GDS network.|$|R

25|$|There may be {{circumstances}} in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages.

Agents connect to <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> equipment through traditional PSTN telephone lines, or over voice over IP. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at <b>the</b> <b>vendor's</b> data centre, {{rather than at the}} {{call centre operator}}'s premises. <b>The</b> <b>vendor's</b> telephony equipment then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.|$|R

25|$|The {{distribution}} {{begins with}} the request for a product by the customer. This can be done automatically when the current product of the customer searches for an update at the online repository.
