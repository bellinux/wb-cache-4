5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, the zoo abandoned its elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote regions where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> properly socialized.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt was strangled in {{the summer}} of 1505 by his three {{retainers}} (including Albert Cupi, Dean of Baranya) who wanted to seize his wealth. His brother, John Ernuszt, brought charges against the assassins, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> sentenced. Cupi was even employed by Ernuszt's successor, George Szatmári. During the investigation which followed his murder, 300,000 gold florins were found and confiscated for the royal treasury.|$|E
5|$|In 1644, Giovanni de’ Medici {{proposed}} that Fort St. Angelo in Birgu be abandoned {{and a new}} fort be constructed on Orsi Point. The new fort would have been also called Fort St. Angelo, and would be manned with the garrison of the old fort. He drew up plans for the proposed fort, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> implemented.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1959 season, only 15 hurricanes {{are known}} to have reached Category5 intensity. There are no known Category5 storms {{occurring}} before 1959. It is possible that some earlier storms reached Category5 over open waters, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> recognized because they never affected land and remained at sea.|$|E
5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed very little to the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.|$|E

5|$|Injury limited him to only 28 {{appearances}} in 1948–49, as Blackpool struggled to a 16th-place finish. He {{spent the summer}} touring theatres in a variety act with his brother Ronnie, though he was troubled by an ankle injury he picked up in a charity game. Blackpool finished seventh in 1949–50, and though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> title contenders vast crowds still turned out home and away to witness the entertaining football they displayed. At this time he received the maximum wage allowed for a professional player – £12 a week.|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1943, a Royal Air Force {{breakdown}} lorry {{heading to the}} airfield at Ta' Qali at night with no street light hit the arch and severely damaged its Santa Venera-facing façade. The central arch was dismantled by military personnel {{under the supervision of}} the Public Works Department about two months later. The arch was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed.|$|E

5|$|Robertson, now Baker's {{literary}} executor, {{was successful}} in having two additional novels published after Baker's death. One of those, Testosterone, was filmed in 2003. Directed by David Moreton and starring Antonio Sabato Jr., the plot was significantly altered and the film was a critical and financial failure. Both Boy Wonder and Fuel-Injected Dreams have been optioned for the movies several times, most recently in 2004, though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> produced. Baker's work has also been published in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Shirayuki {{handed over}} the rescued seamen to troops on Endau the {{following}} day. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> seen again, but {{are believed to have}} been executed in retaliation for losses sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion, which occurred south of Mersing {{about the same time as}} the naval action off Endau. Davies, four other officers, and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore and made their way to Singapore, together with shot down aircrew.|$|E
5|$|Shooting for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{began at}} the end of December 1919 and {{concluded}} {{at the end of}} January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. But Hermann Warm claimed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.|$|E

5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists {{do not know if}} sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> deposited in the first place. Either way, this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E
5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E

5|$|Although the Palaeologi {{emperors}} recaptured Constantinople {{from the}} Western Europeans in 1261, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> able {{to regain control}} of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to the plight of the Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began {{to attract the attention of}} biologists, and were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> classified as any of these.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1915 and June 1916, Bogdan-Pitești managed another press venue, Libertatea ("Freedom"). Its {{political}} director was retired statesman Nicolae Fleva, later replaced by Arghezi. In February 1916, Galaction and Arghezi launched Cronica, another review with a pro-German agenda, and which may itself {{have been published}} with discreet assistance from Bogdan-Pitești. Although Bogdan-Pitești, Domnica and Caragiale paid a mysterious visit to Berlin in early 1916, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>never</b> listed as foreign spies by Siguranța Statului counter-intelligence. Bogdan-Pitești's name then surfaced in a February 1916 conversation between German statesman Matthias Erzberger and Raymund Netzhammer, the Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest. Erzberger asked if the Vlaici landowner could ever help advance the Germanophile cause; the Archbishop, a loyal German subject, replied that Bogdan-Pitești was unreliable. Allegations later surfaced that Bogdan-Pitești {{was one of the}} men receiving payoffs from the German spy Albert E. Günther, manager of Steaua Română company. The dossier attesting this was lost, but secondary sources have it that Bogdan-Pitești alone received 840,000 lei from Günther's hands.|$|E
