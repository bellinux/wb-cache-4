5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage. It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May 1957 the BBC {{produced}} a live outside broadcast from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated {{on a trip}} from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500passengers carried, and <b>this</b> <b>increase</b> in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No.1 Talyllyn returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. <b>This</b> <b>increase</b> in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century {{and led to a}} surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.|$|E

Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the money always keeps circulating locally, benefiting only the local economy.|$|R

Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds).

5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, St. Louis became home to a {{substantial}} Bosnian immigrant community, which became the second-largest in the United States in 1999. The city also began to see an increase in immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Many immigrants reported moving to St. Louis, particularly its south side Bevo Mill neighborhood, due to the low cost of living compared to other American cities. Despite <b>this</b> <b>increase,</b> the foreign-born population of the St. Louis region was roughly one-third of the national average in 2010.|$|E

As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months.

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>increase</b> of {{interest}} in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as Underworld and Van Helsing, and the Russian Night Watch and a TV miniseries remake of Salem's Lot, both from 2004. The series Blood Ties premiered on Lifetime Television in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England turned vampire, in modern-day Toronto, with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled True Blood, gives a Southern Gothic take to the vampire theme.|$|E
