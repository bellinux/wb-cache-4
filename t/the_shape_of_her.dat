Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa {{and that she had}} been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E
5|$|Whistler was {{not entirely}} content with the realism the {{painting}} displayed in its original form, a trait he blamed on the influence Courbet had on him at the time. Later, between 1867 and 1872, he reworked it {{to give it a}} more spiritual expression. Even though Symphony was begun before Whistler first met Rossetti, the Pre-Raphaelite influence is still clear. The painting was an early experiment in white on white, with a woman standing in a white dress in front of a white background. This colour scheme was a subject he would return to later, in two paintings that would be given the titles of Symphony in White, No. 2 (1864) and Symphony in White, No. 3 (1865–67). The panel is long and slender, and the model's pose and <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clothes further emphasise the vertical nature of the painting. The woman is bold, almost confrontational, in her direct gaze at the viewer, and her features are highly individualised. Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E

500|$|Mona Simpson {{was drawn}} {{in a way}} so {{that she has a}} little bit of Homer in her face, such as <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> upper lip and her nose.

500|$|Glenn Close, who was {{directed}} by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way {{so that she would}} somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say [...] "d'oh!" [...] properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on May 24, 1988, and contained video compilation of two different dates from the tour, Turin and from Florence, as well as clips from her concert in Tokyo, Japan. The video had an introduction, where Madonna was shown practicing with her troupe on the stage, rehearsing the songs and the dance moves. Madonna, who had gone through rigorous exercises and aerobics to prepare herself for the tour, demanded from director Egbert van Hees that <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body be given prominence in the footage {{to be used for}} the video. She believed that her new shape and figure would make her appear highly attractive. In 1999, Warner Bros. re-released the video in DVD format, along with some of Madonna's other video albums. The music video appears in an aspect ratio of [...] (4:3) on the single-sided, single-layered DVD. The concert relied heavily on magenta tones; from the lighting to Madonna’s outfits. A stereo soundtrack accompanied the DVD release, where the songs were mixed without having a surround sound effect.|$|E

500|$|Mona Penelope Simpson (née Olsen), {{voiced by}} Glenn Close, is Homer's {{deceased}} long-lost mother and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] where she reveals {{that she was}} forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the hippie movement and participated in various acts of activism. The writers used this episode as an opportunity to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. Prior to the seventh season, Mona Simpson had only made two brief flashback appearances, the first being season two's [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] and the second being season six's [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] and in both episodes she was voiced by Maggie Roswell. Mona dies in the episode [...] "Mona Leaves-a", as Homer struggles {{to come to terms with}} her death. The character is named after writer Richard Appel's wife, whose maiden name is Mona Simpson. Mona was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. Glenn Close recorded original material for another episode, season fifteen's [...] "My Mother the Carjacker". Mona also has a speaking appearance in season ten's [...] "D'oh-in in the Wind", this time voiced by Tress MacNeille.|$|E

50|$|Venables’ {{exposure}} to European traditions {{as well as}} trainings at various academic institutions resulted in <b>the</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> philosophy and style. While Venables {{was a student at}} Bard, she discovered her artistic style when she revisited the house of a childhood friend who was an older woman that had died. Venables had magical memories of the house and everything in the house, including the smell and sound, remained exactly the same as when she was a child. Although the friend, an artist as well, was not physically present, the way she decorated her house reflected her artwork and herself. Thus taking photographs of the house from different angles are portraits of the friend and of Venables’ time revisiting her world. Her goal was to connect her memories with the present physical space. This was the defining style of Venables’ future work.|$|R

[...] Similarly, Davey C.

50|$|Karin Putsch-Grassi’s {{technique}} is stimulated by experimenting with new techniques and clays. She works on <b>the</b> relationship between <b>shape</b> and surface, using both throwing and also slap building as <b>her</b> creative technique. <b>The</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pieces are simple, {{and have a}} well-defined and linear outline. The final appearance {{is the result of}} processes similar to those that nature undergoes, i.e. submitted to continuous changes by atmospheric factors.Most recently, Karin Putsch-Grassi has been using the technique named by her as “CUT & STRETCH”. It consists of making incisions in the surface of the ceramic work, which is subsequently pulled, lengthened or even widened until it creates uncontrollable clefts and fissures which are produced by the non-uniform thickness and by the consistency of the clay. The surface shows the traces of the work progress, and it is the firing of the piece that establishes this special moment.|$|R
2500|$|Stella's {{replacement}} Lunafreya {{was conceived}} by Tabata; {{he wanted a}} heroine who would properly portray the darker and more somber elements of the rewritten story of Final Fantasy XV. Lunafreya was described as the [...] "keystone" [...] linking the narratives of Final Fantasy XV, Kingsglaive and Brotherhood. While {{she did not have}} an active role in Kingsglaive, her character strength was conveyed through a single-minded determination. During the design process, it was decided that Lunafreya would assume and accept responsibility from a young age, putting her in direct contrast with Noctis; this required Lunafreya to be older than Noctis, which influenced elements of her character design. According to Tabata, the relationship between Noctis and Lunafreya was not a typical love story despite their being engaged. He also defined Lunafreya's personality as being stronger than either Stella or Noctis. Lunafreya was designed by Naora. Her appearance was defined by Tabata as [...] "strong and heroic", which would be conveyed by her expressions and actions. Lunafreya was designed to give off the look of a strong-willed woman. To achieve this, the designers focused on <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes and mouth, blending her appearance in Final Fantasy XV with that in Kingsglaive so she could project an air of grace and strength even when standing still. Her expressions reflected a notably wide range of emotions born from her goals, which resulted in her expression being [...] "serious and somewhat sad". To convey Lunafreya's strong will and her high-born status through her appearance, Naora consulted a professional hairstylist and makeup artist; the way makeup was applied to her eyes and mouth was changed accordingly, and her hairstyle was done to resemble [...] "something that would require the assistance of a handmaiden". Care was taken not to make her too prim, so that players could relate more to her.|$|E
