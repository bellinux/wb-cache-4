5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left {{to go to the}} nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's {{trouble with}} her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive {{to speak with}} Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up {{on the fact that}} Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and panics. Meanwhile, Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found {{at the scene of the}} crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E

50|$|The cheek bulges, and {{the wide}} and deep {{depression}} below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, whereby {{it is possible for}} such an animal to pull <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth are fixed and very close to <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal {{would not be able to}} suck unless <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around <b>the</b> teat <b>of</b> a milk gland.|$|R
25|$|The singer may {{occasionally}} adopt {{a position}} facing <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and away from}} the audience, with eyes closed, a position that has acoustic benefits, aids concentration for performing long intricate songs from memory, and perhaps has some additional ancient significance.|$|E
25|$|Under the 1830 Act any householder {{who paid}} rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £ today), to sell beer or cider {{in his home}} (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels {{on a table in}} <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

50|$|This bifid {{variation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle originates as {{a single}} structure from the zygomatic bone. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth.|$|R
2500|$|Green Lake Room:The {{uppermost}} of the [...] "Scenic Rooms", it {{is named}} for a deep, malachite-colored pool in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In the 1940s, when the military was testing the feasibility of Carlsbad Cavern as an emergency fallout shelter, the Green Lake was used to look for ripples caused by a nuclear bomb test many miles away. None appeared.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 Super Bowl XLII GoDaddy {{advertisement}} {{received a}} negative {{response from the}} press. Adweeks Barbara Lippert {{described it as a}} [...] "poorly produced scene in a living room where people are gathered to watch the Super Bowl. As we watch them watch, a guy at his computer in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> drags the crowd over to GoDaddy.com to view the banned ad instead." [...] Lippert also said, [...] "it will probably produce a Pavlovian response in getting actual viewers in their own living rooms to do the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundaries}} of the camp and the number, use and location of its buildings evolved during the war, but certain main divisions of the camp existed for significant periods of time. [...] "Garrison Square" [...] contained officers' quarters, post headquarters, a post office and parade ground. [...] "White Oak Square" [...] housed both Union soldiers and prisoners until late in 1863. White Oak Square included the original camp prison and the building that would become the infamous [...] "White Oak Dungeon." [...] Prisoners who were being punished were subject to close confinement in small, dark and dirty conditions in this [...] "dungeon." [...] The [...] "dungeon" [...] was a room , lit by one closely barred window about [...] off the floor, with entry only through a hatch about [...] square in the ceiling. The room had a damp floor and an intolerable stench from a sink (latrine) in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is a {{pyramidal}} roof on {{towers of}} square plan. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof is rhomboid in form, {{with the long}} diagonal running from <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> roof to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supporting tower. Each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower is topped with an even triangular gable from <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> which runs a ridge to <b>the</b> apex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof. Thus <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyramidical roof do not correspond with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower but with <b>the</b> peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gables.|$|R

2500|$|Next Dann {{drove the}} {{children}} {{back to their}} home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, but the boys spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to {{set fire to the}} house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape). [...] She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. She wandered into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a [...]22 semi-automatic Beretta pistol. Her Smith & Wesson [...]357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm. Dann then re-entered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a [...]32 Smith & Wesson from the waistband of her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car.|$|E
2500|$|Olivia is {{revealed}} {{to be linked to}} the drug Cortexiphan, a chemical developed by William Bell, which supposedly allows children injected with it to retain higher brain functions which would normally deteriorate with age. Olivia was {{one of a group of}} preschool-age children who served as subjects of the experiment in her childhood home of Jacksonville, Florida. [...] As a result, Olivia is capable of unspecified psychic abilities, as demonstrated when she shuts off a series of lights wired into a bomb as a kill switch simply by thinking it. Walter has a video of Olivia as a child, ostensibly recorded during the drug trials, which shows her curled up in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> next to a badly charred bed with Walter saying: [...] "It's all right, you didn't mean it." [...] We later learn that Olivia started the fire with her mind. Olivia also had the ability to discern if an object originated in the alternate dimension due to a [...] "glimmer" [...] that only she could see. When trying to reawaken this ability in her as an adult, Dr. Bishop hypothesized that this ability was partially derived from Olivia's fear about seeing into the alternate dimension. [...] When Olivia regains part of her memories of her meeting with Bell, she is told that she is the only successful subject suitable to pass through dimensions without many known negative side-effects. She has been called the guardian of the gateway by Bell, who will prevent the invasion by the alternate dimension.|$|E
