5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Lake Waiau {{provided}} {{drinking water}} for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cords of newborn babies in its water, {{to give them the}} strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>umbilicals</b> {{also have}} cables for {{electrical}} {{power to the}} bell and helmet lights, and for voice communications and closed circuit video cameras. In some cases the breathing gas is recovered to save the expensive helium. This is done through a reclaim hose in <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals,</b> which ducts exhaled gas through a reclaim valve, through <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals</b> {{and back to the}} surface, where the carbon dioxide is scrubbed and the gas boosted into storage cylinders for later use.|$|R
50|$|A {{gas panel}} inside the bell is {{supplied}} by <b>the</b> bell <b>umbilical</b> and <b>the</b> emergency gas cylinders, and supplies <b>the</b> divers' <b>umbilicals</b> and sometimes BIBS sets. There will be racks to hang <b>the</b> divers' <b>umbilicals,</b> which for this application {{must not be}} buoyant.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> left <b>umbilical</b> vein disappears, whereas <b>the</b> right <b>umbilical</b> vein partly remains, {{with its}} {{peripheral}} and central portions developing into the ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosum, respectively. According to this (Matsumoto’s) hypothesis, <b>the</b> right <b>umbilical</b> portion should {{lie to the}} right of the gallbladder bed.|$|R
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and providing it through <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 30ft (9m). Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously {{delivered}} unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant {{was found on}} the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord. The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> diver's <b>umbilical</b> {{length is}} {{generally}} limited {{to prevent the}} diver from reaching hazard zones from <b>the</b> bell. <b>The</b> <b>umbilicals</b> may be tied off at the racks to limit the deployable length to about 5m less than the shortest distance to the hazard, or in-water tending may be used.|$|R
50|$|Lateral to this {{structure}} are <b>the</b> medial <b>umbilical</b> ligament (which {{is a different}} structure, not to be confused) and <b>the</b> lateral <b>umbilical</b> ligament.|$|R
30|$|In the infraumbilical properitoneal {{space are}} the urachus and <b>the</b> obliterated <b>umbilical</b> arteries, which are {{developmental}} remnants, forming the medial and <b>the</b> median <b>umbilical</b> ligaments, respectively [18].|$|R
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord of {{a newborn}} is bluish-white in color. After birth, <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord is {{normally}} cut, leaving a 1–2inch stub. <b>The</b> <b>umbilical</b> stub will dry out, shrivel, darken, and spontaneously fall off within about 3 weeks. This will later become a belly-button after it heals. Occasionally, hospitals may apply triple dye to <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> stub to prevent infection, which may temporarily color the stub and surrounding skin purple.|$|E
50|$|It {{represents}} the remnant of <b>the</b> fetal <b>umbilical</b> arteries, which serves no purpose in humans after birth, {{except for the}} initial part that becomes <b>the</b> adult <b>umbilical</b> artery.|$|R
50|$|As {{soon as the}} diver is breathing, {{the bell}} will be {{returned}} to the surface. This requires <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals</b> to be cleared from the trunking and the door sealed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> medial <b>umbilical</b> {{ligament}} (or cord of umbilical artery) is a paired structure {{found in}} human anatomy. It {{is on the}} deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall, and is covered by <b>the</b> medial <b>umbilical</b> folds (plicae umbilicales mediales). It {{should not be confused}} with <b>the</b> median <b>umbilical</b> ligament, a different structure that represents the remnant of the embryonic urachus.|$|R
25|$|Umbilical hernia* is {{a failure}} of <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> ring of the {{abdominal}} wall to close. They are very common and {{can be caused by}} genetics or by traction on <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord or by the cord being cut too close to the body. They are corrected by surgery.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> vein is {{directly}} connected to the central circulation, {{it can be used}} as a route for placement of a venous catheter for infusion and medication. <b>The</b> <b>umbilical</b> vein catheter is a reliable alternative to percutaneous peripheral or central venous catheters or intraosseous canulas and may be employed in resuscitation or intensive care of the newborn.|$|E

50|$|Code red - Divers {{return to}} the bell without delaying to {{retrieve}} tools and prepare for immediate ascent. The bell can not be recovered until <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals</b> have been safely stowed.|$|R
5000|$|The mishap was {{traced to}} an {{unforeseen}} design {{flaw in the}} silo's construction - {{there was not enough}} room for <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals</b> to detach properly which resulted in wiring being ripped out of the Titan. It was solved by adding extra lanyards to <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals</b> so they would have sufficient [...] "play" [...] in them to separate without damaging the missile. The flight was nonetheless considered a [...] "partial" [...] success in that the Titan had cleared the silo successfully. The inadvertent rolling motion of the vehicle may have also prevented a worse disaster as it added stability and prevented it from colliding with the silo walls as it ascended.|$|R
50|$|Helium {{is a very}} {{effective}} heat transfer material, and divers may lose heat rapidly if the surrounding water is cold. To prevent hypothermia, hot-water suits are commonly used for saturation diving, and the breathing gas supply may be heated. Heated water is produced at the surface and piped to the bell through a hot-water line in <b>the</b> bell <b>umbilical,</b> then is transferred to the divers through their excursion umbilicals.The umbilicals also have cables for electrical power to the bell and helmet lights, and for voice communications and closed circuit video cameras. In some cases the breathing gas is recovered to save the expensive helium. This is done through a reclaim hose in <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals,</b> which ducts exhaled gas through a reclaim valve, through <b>the</b> <b>umbilicals</b> {{and back to the}} surface, where the carbon dioxide is scrubbed and the gas boosted into storage cylinders for later use.|$|R
25|$|The human venous system {{develops}} {{mainly from}} the vitelline veins, <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> veins and the cardinal veins, all of which empty into the sinus venosus.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord in some mammals, {{including}} {{cows and}} sheep, contains two distinct umbilical veins. There {{is only one}} umbilical vein in the human umbilical cord.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{and other}} placental mammals have an {{umbilical}} scar (commonly {{referred to as}} to a navel) which starts to heal when <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord is cut after birth.|$|E
50|$|The medial {{inguinal}} fossa is {{a depression}} {{located within the}} inguinal triangle on the peritoneal surface of the anterior abdominal wall between the ridges formed by <b>the</b> lateral <b>umbilical</b> fold and <b>the</b> medial <b>umbilical</b> ligament, corresponding to the superficial inguinal ring.|$|R
50|$|Both wet {{bells and}} closed bells use a bell {{umbilical}} to provide surface supplied gas, electrical power, communications and heating {{water to the}} bell and through the bell gas panel to the divers. It may also return reclaimed breathing gas from the divers to the surface gas system. <b>The</b> bell <b>umbilical</b> is generally not intended for lifting the bell. <b>The</b> bell <b>umbilical</b> is connected to through-hull fittings on a closed bell, which {{are connected to the}} bell panel inside, for distribution to the interior of the bell and to the divers via <b>the</b> diver's <b>umbilicals.</b> <b>The</b> bell gas panel is operated by the bellman.|$|R
25|$|While in {{the water}} the divers will often use a hot water suit {{to protect against the}} cold. The hot water comes from boilers on the surface and is pumped down to the diver via <b>the</b> bell's <b>umbilical</b> and then through <b>the</b> diver's <b>umbilical.</b>|$|R
25|$|Breathing gases may be {{supplied}} {{from the surface}} through a diver's umbilical, or airline hose, which provides breathing gas, communications and a safety line, with options for a hot water hose for heating, a video cable and gas reclaim line. The diver's breathing gas supply is significantly more secure than for scuba; communications are simplified and the divers position is either known or can be traced reliably by following <b>the</b> <b>umbilical.</b> Several major risks are thereby mitigated, but the system also has serious disadvantages in some applications, as diver mobility is constrained by the length of <b>the</b> <b>umbilical,</b> and it may snag on obstructions.|$|E
25|$|The blood within <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord, {{known as}} cord blood, {{is a rich}} and readily {{available}} source of primitive, undifferentiated stem cells (of type CD34-positive and CD38-negative). These cord blood cells {{can be used for}} bone marrow transplant.|$|E
25|$|Cord blood can be {{harvested}} from <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> cord {{of a child}} being born after preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching (see PGD for HLA matching) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> lateral <b>umbilical</b> fold is an {{important}} reference site with regards to hernia classification. A direct hernia occurs medial to <b>the</b> lateral <b>umbilical</b> fold, whereas an indirect hernia originates lateral to the fold. This later case {{is due to the}} placement of the opening of the deep inguinal ring in the space lateral to <b>the</b> lateral <b>umbilical</b> fold, which allows the passage of the ductus deferens, testicular artery, and other components of the spermatic cord in men, or the round ligament of the uterus in women.|$|R
