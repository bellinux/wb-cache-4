The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and <b>the</b> <b>players</b> would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E

50|$|It {{is found}} that either Alwan or Greta will leave <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> group {{depending}} on which faction <b>the</b> <b>player</b> joins.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of each player's turn, {{based on the number of}} countries <b>the</b> <b>player</b> owns and whole continents <b>the</b> <b>player</b> holds, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> gains additional MODs and energy. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> places <b>the</b> MODs and then has the opportunity to buy additional commanders, cards, and space stations. Then <b>the</b> <b>player</b> may play command cards that he has sufficient energy to activate. Next comes the attack phase which, if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> successfully takes three contested territories, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> receives one bonus energy and one bonus command card.

50|$|The plot {{starts off}} with the start of <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> racing career in Angel City. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> starts racing a new crew leader called Nina (Crew name: Total Power Junkies), who doesn't respect <b>the</b> <b>player</b> and thinks that <b>the</b> <b>player</b> does not {{have what it takes}} to beat her in a race. She lets <b>the</b> <b>player</b> use one of her cars and wagers a bet with <b>the</b> <b>player</b> (<b>the</b> same with TK in the {{original}} Juiced). After <b>the</b> <b>player</b> beats her in the race, she gives <b>the</b> <b>player</b> more respect, and apologizes for being pushy before the race, as well as giving <b>the</b> <b>player</b> her cell phone number. This is where the career starts, giving <b>the</b> <b>player</b> a wider choice of race events and allowing <b>the</b> <b>player</b> to collect cars and get more respect from Nina and other crew leaders.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>player</b> must {{successfully}} qualify {{in eight}} different races to win. At <b>the</b> beginning, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> must take 80th place or better to advance.

If <b>the</b> <b>player</b> fails to meet to qualify or if the timer runs out, the game is over. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> does, however, {{have the option to}} continue, but if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> fails to qualify in the final race, the game is automatically over, and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> cannot continue.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{presented}} in 3rd person.

50|$|Interacting with <b>the</b> <b>Player's</b> Zooble or meeting other Zoobles lets it earn Zoints, {{which were}} {{important}} on unlocking other Zoobles in the game, a spring and a slide for <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> Zooble to play with. Also, interacting with other Zoobles and playing minigames can earn more Zoints and when <b>the</b> <b>player</b> collected enough Zoints, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can advance to another region, thought he cannot take <b>the</b> Zooble <b>the</b> <b>player</b> chose to that new region and must choose a new Zooble to advance.

5000|$|The {{only way}} <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can {{interact}} with this world directly is through <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> hand, with which <b>the</b> <b>player</b> {{can pick up}} people, trees, food, and influence <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>player</b> can also cast miracles. However, {{a certain amount of}} [...] "Prayer Power" [...] (in essence, [...] "Mana") from <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> believers is needed to do this.One of the game's most innovative features is that its user interface is almost button-less. The HUD is much simpler than other such [...] "creator" [...] series, such as The Sims and RollerCoaster Tycoon, and <b>the</b> <b>player</b> sees little else on the screen but <b>the</b> world, <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> hand, and toolbars which <b>the</b> <b>player</b> can make disappear. To do things such as cast miracles, <b>the</b> <b>player</b> moves <b>the</b> hand in such {{a way to make a}} symbol on the ground, which is called a gesture. This activates the miracle, and if <b>the</b> <b>player</b> has enough mana, it appears in <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> hand ready to cast.|$|R
50|$|Areas {{are marked}} by <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> progress.

5|$|Until the 1906–07 season, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> {{were not}} paid to play hockey, {{as the team}} was abiding by the {{principles}} of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. <b>The</b> <b>players</b> could work for the government, and the work allowed <b>the</b> <b>players</b> {{to play for the}} team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status of each and every player had to be publicized.|$|E
5|$|A Joust-themed pinball {{table was}} {{released}} in 1983, designed by Barry Oursler and Constantino Mitchell. The game includes artwork and themes from the arcade version.

50|$|The game focuses {{mostly on}} reality {{fighting}} than fictional.

50|$|The game is {{presented}} in 3rd person.

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> {{they refused}} to divulge more {{strategic}} material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One of the most publicised {{of a series of}} betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, the matter was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine <b>the</b> <b>players.</b> The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards <b>the</b> <b>players</b> hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict <b>the</b> <b>players,</b> and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, <b>the</b> <b>players</b> received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes.

50|$|Dhoos: When {{a player}} is found {{cheating}} or {{making a mistake}} while playing the game, then <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is made to pay all <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> Generally <b>the</b> <b>player</b> pays 15 points to each of <b>the</b> remaining <b>player.</b> In some places <b>the</b> <b>player</b> pays total points collected on that round to each of <b>the</b> other <b>player.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{kinds of}} enemies {{are found in}} the game, each of which reacts to <b>the</b> <b>player</b> differently.
