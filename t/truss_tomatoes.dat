It opened in October 2016 and produces 39MW of thermal energy from over 23000 mirrors and a 127 m tower, used for heating, electricity, and desalination to irrigate tomatoes in greenhouses.

50|$|As of 2015, Sundrop Farms is {{constructing}} a 20 hectare solar-powered greenhouse facility near its original site, south of Port Augusta in South Australia. This facility, scheduled for completion in 2016, {{is expected to}} produce 15,000 tons of <b>truss</b> <b>tomatoes</b> each year to supply the Australian supermarket operator Coles under a ten-year contract. Sundrop Farms operations will be primarily powered by a new concentrated solar thermal power plant and seawater will be withdrawn from Spencer Gulf and desalinated to feed produce. The project was expected to generate around 100 jobs during {{the construction of the}} greenhouse facility (underway as at October 2015) and approximately 200 jobs once operational. In 2014, private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts invested $100 million in the company. The development has been supported by the Government of South Australia which has provided approximately $6 million in grant funding. A $150 million development contract was awarded to John Holland in 2014 to construct the expanded facility over an 18-24 month time-frame and the total project cost is an estimated $205 million.|$|E
40|$|For a more {{sustainable}} greenhouse horticulture, a considerable {{reduction of the}} use of energy is needed, but trade-offs with production and quality are not acceptable. The Next Generation Greenhouse Cultivation is a concept for energy saving, consisting of modules that can be implemented step by step into practice.

To validate the results of a desk study an experiment in a greenhouse of 1000 m 2 equipped according to the concept was performed. The experiment proved {{that it was possible to}} produce 69 kg. m- 2 <b>truss</b> <b>tomatoes</b> with an energy demand for heating of 750 MJ. m- 2.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{automated}} vegetable-harvesting level, a robot system for <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> harvesting and two key technologies of picking-point recognition and end-effector design were proposed. An algorithm used the segmentation feature of the color difference 2 r-g-b to recognize the <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> fruit and the assistant mark. According to the growth characteristics of the stem of <b>tomato</b> <b>truss,</b> the approximate fitting curve of stem and the contour of assistant mark were extracted to generate the optimal picking-point for location of <b>tomato</b> <b>truss.</b> The hardware structure of an end-effector based on flexible transmission was designed, and the function of cutting and grasping could be realized simultaneously by the end-effector.

40|$|Deep {{sea water}} (DSW) that {{was applied to}} 3 <b>trusses</b> of {{cultivated}} <b>tomato</b> for 2 weeks affected fruits properties. However, advantageous effects on the soluble solids content, acidity, and dry matter content of the fruit tend to decline from 1 st truss to the successive trusses. Thus {{it is necessary to}} study the effect of DSW application when it is applied for longer than 2 weeks in cultivated multi-trusses. In this study, DSW treatment was applied for different durations to obtain effect on fruits development and fruit properties of the 1 st to 3 rd truss in a 3 <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> cultivation system using a nutrient film technique. The results of the study show that DSW treatment has strong effect on fruit enlargement during the stage of rapid fruit growth, which lasts until the fruit almost reaches the final size. Treated plants produced tomatoes with better organoleptic with higher soluble solids content and higher acidity, higher dry matter content, a thicker and more resistant cuticle and also gave higher yields (weight and no of fruits) than in single <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> cultivation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} source-sink {{relationships}} {{on the performance}} of tomato and hot pepper was investigated in glasshouse experiments by pruning <b>tomato</b> <b>trusses</b> and hot pepper fruit from plants trained to a single stem. The objectives were to characterize the effect of time, method and intensity of pruning on the yield and quality of tomato and hot pepper. Pruning at anthesis as compared to pruning at fruit-set had little effect on yield and fruit quality of both crops. Yield per truss increased steadily with intensity of pruning in tomato, due to increase in fruit size and fruit number per truss. Thus, total yield was not affected by pruning. In hot pepper fruit size increased with intensity of pruning but total yield was significantly reduced and total plant dry mass depressed at higher source : sink ratios (two and three fruit pruned {{out of a total of}} six). Occurrence of fruit disorders such as blossom-end rot and fruit cracking increased with increasing source: sink ratio. Pruning of one <b>truss</b> in <b>tomato</b> and one fruit in hot pepper gave the best fruit quality in terms of fruit size, pericarp thickness and freedom from defects, without decreasing total and marketable yield. Removing a middle <b>truss</b> of <b>tomato</b> (third <b>truss)</b> gave the highest yield as compared to removing the youngest truss (sixth truss) or the oldest truss (first truss). The yield increase (relative to the control) in the remaining individual trusses tended to decrease with increasing distance of the trusses from the pruned truss. In hot pepper removal of the youngest fruit (sixth fruit) resulted in the highest yield in comparison to removal of the middle fruit (third fruit) and the oldest fruit (first fruit). The quantity of yield increase in the remaining individual fruits had no consistent trend regarding the relative distance of the fruits from the pruned fruit. Two pruning methods were tried on hot pepper and tomato to compare yield and fruit quality. The first method involved pruning of the first three consecutive <b>trusses</b> of <b>tomato</b> and the first three consecutive fruit of hot pepper out of a total of six. The second method involved pruning of three alternating <b>tomato</b> <b>trusses</b> or hot pepper fruit. Yield and yield components did not differ significantly for the two methods, but pruning alternate <b>trusses</b> of <b>tomato</b> and fruit of hot pepper reduced occurrence of fruit disorders.

40|$|Some {{hundred years}} ago, wise men decided that preharvest {{research}} and applications {{had to be}} regarded separated from the postharvest handling and behaviour. Over the years, both areas developed completely separated. Control over both areas was obtained by different companies and advisory boards, with mostly not too good means of communication between them. This decision hampered seriously the consistent and integral development of knowledge on food production and usage. Bridging the gap between all the knowledge and expertise available in the preharvest area of growing food and the postharvest area of storing and processing food, has become and is still {{becoming more and more}} important {{over the last couple of}} years. In this paper, based on theoretical considerations, on plausible (but unproven) mechanisms and applying the fundamental rules of chemical kinetics, a pathway to deduce general and generic models is developed towards a possible approach to integrate all available knowledge. Still the validity of this approach is not proven. However, a number of examples from both the applied as well as the fundamental point of view are elaborated to indicate such an interaction exists, and to indicate how to tackle the modelling problem. The examples range from physiological disorders like core brown, internal brown, chilling injury and the biological age of individual tomatoes in <b>truss</b> <b>tomatoes</b> as related to the maturity at harves...|$|E
40|$|High tomato diets {{have been}} {{observed}} to significantly {{reduce the risk of}} prostate cancer; however, the causal agents within tomato that produce this effect are uncertain. Lycopene, the principle and highly abundant carotenoid within tomato fruit, has been suggested to be the major causative agent due to its in vitro antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic effects; however, in vivo evidence is inconclusive, with whole tomato supplementation being more protective than pure lycopene. This implicates the involvement of other tomato nutrients and carotenoids in the protective effect. This was investigated by applying hexane extracts of tomatoes with or without alltrans- lycopene as their principal fruit carotenoid, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran to PC 3 prostate cancer cells. High performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array analysis verified that orange grape (RO) and tangerine (TAN) tomatoes had almost exclusively β-carotene and tetra-cis-lycopene as their principal carotenoid, respectively. In contrast, red grape (RR), tangerine wild-type (TWT), and commercial truss (<b>TRUSS)</b> <b>tomatoes</b> contained predominantly all-trans-lycopene. An MTT cell inhibition assay revealed that the TAN tomato extract treatment had a barely significant inhibitory effect upon PC 3 cells compared with the control, while β- carotene tomato extracts had no significant impact on PC 3 proliferation. When the tomato lines with all-trans-lycopene as their predominant carotenoid were pooled, a similar inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth was observed, with a tendency for TAN tomato extract to inhibit growth slightly better. This preliminary study demonstrates that tetra-cis-lycopene as well as all-trans lycopene may both have an anti-carcinogenic effect on prostate cancer cells...|$|E

40|$|Two {{promising}} {{techniques to}} measure water uptake {{in a direct}} way were evaluated on substrate-grown <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> plants (Lycopersicon esculentum 'Clothilde'). The first technique, which is called the mass-balance technique, determines tomato water uptake using automated weight measurements of substrate mass and collected leachate. It was found that leachate could not be recorded appropriately in a 1 -minute time interval by the tipping bucket gauges used in this study. Therefore, the tipping bucket readings had to be corrected and modified. The second technique computes the water uptake by a single tomato plant based on the thermal energy balance of a stem segment and, therefore, {{it is called the}} heat-balance technique. The stem segment was carefully selected {{at the base of a}} tomato stem so that the whole-plant water uptake could be determined. However, it was found that an independent measurement of minimum water uptake during the night was needed to correctly calculate water uptake during the whole day. As a result, the major pitfalls of the two techniques were identified. With appropriate modifications, a good correlation between the measurements was found, even during a period of imposed drought stress. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Postharvest storage, {{handling}} {{and distribution of}} fruit at low temperatures {{is the most common}} and manageable approach to control ripening and subsequent deterioration and to maximize product shelf-life. However, tomatoes, as many other subtropical fruits, are susceptible to develop symptoms of chilling injury, a physiological disorder caused by the exposure to low temperature above the freezing point. Development of chilling injury depends on temperature, time, ripening stage and tomato type/cultivar. We studied the effect of home-refrigerator storage temperature on the quality of two types of tomato: cocktail tomato (cultivars ‘Amoroso’ and ‘Brioso’) and <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> (cultivars ‘Capricia’ and ‘Roterno’). Fully ripe tomatoes were stored for 10 days at two temperatures: 4 °C as simulation of home-refrigerator storage and 15 °C as an optimal storage temperature. We evaluated several quality parameters: weight loss, firmness, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, carbohydrates, titratable acidity and citrate content. Although we did not observe any apparent symptom of chilling injury, we found that 4 °C temperature stimulates firmness decay in both cocktail tomato cultivars, increasing fruit susceptibility to mechanical injury. Moreover, already after 5 days of 4 °C storage, tomatoes generally showed decreased sugar and increased acid content (especially in cocktail tomatoes) compared to 15 °C stored fruit, indicating a loss of sensoric quality at 4 °C...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{horticulture}} {{is driven}} by quality and yield, which are highly dependent on plant health status. Today the grower can only react and intervene when symptoms become visible {{but in most cases}} with already irrecoverable damage. The challenge is to monitor the plant's physiological status in a continuous way to anticipate unfavourable environmental conditions more rapidly. The objective of the reported research was to develop real-time mathematical algorithms to monitor plant stress as a basis for an on-line early-warning system. <b>Truss</b> <b>tomato</b> plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Clothilde') were cultivated inside two greenhouse compartments. During the growing season several severe and moderate stress conditions such as an increased and decreased indoor temperature were applied alternately in between the two compartments. In total 17 stress experiments were executed, duplicated over two compartments. The stress intensity was function of the outdoor climate and the duration of the applied stressor such that the achieved minimal indoor temperature ranged from 12. 8 degrees C to 16 degrees C for the cold shock and the maximal indoor temperature ranged from 27. 6 degrees C to 36. 7 degrees C for the heat shock. Climate and plant variables were sampled every 20 seconds. Leaf temperature was measured as a plant response and was on-line modelled as function of climate variables with a black-box model approach. The plant health status was evaluated by the calculated steady state gain of the black box model. Depending on stress intensity and health status of the plant in combination with the environmental conditions changes in plant status could be detected, some minutes after stress situations were applied.

40|$|A novel {{system for}} heating/cooling {{greenhouses}} based on air/water heat exchangers {{connected to a}} thermally stratified water storage tank was tested in a small greenhouse compartment at the Experimental Station of the Cajamar Foundation in Almería, Spain. The system maintained a closed greenhouse (no natural ventilation) throughout the winter and spring during which a <b>truss</b> <b>tomato</b> crop was grown. Atmospheric CO 2 concentration could be maintained during the daytime allowing for greater net photosynthesis {{in relation to a}} reference greenhouse in which traditional natural ventilation was used to control temperature and humidity. Three fine wire heat exchangers (Fiwihex®) were installed 1 m above the crop when at full development. The heat exchangers allowed for a very efficient transfer of the sensible and latent heat accumulated in the compartment. During the winter, the daytime temperatures were maintained below the ventilation set point (30 °C). During the night, the system was able to maintain temperatures above the heating set point (12 °C), with stored warm water temperatures between 15 and 17 °C after clear days. After cloudy days, with water temperatures between 11 and 13 °C, the system could always keep a temperature gradient with the exterior of 4 - 6 °C, enough to maintain greenhouse air temperatures above 8 °C the entire night. When seasonal night air temperatures exceeded the heating set point, the hot water {{at the top of the}} tank was cooled to the wet bulb temperature by means of an open cooling tower. The cooled water was used for cooling the greenhouse, which allowed for closing the greenhouse for a longer period. The water condensate during the cooling mode, allowed for a high water saving and maintained the relative humidity very constant during the day (around 80 %). During the night, humidity was kept at 90 % without ever reaching saturation...|$|R

40|$|The {{systemic}} {{model for}} floral induction, dubbed florigen, was conceived in photoperiod-sensitive plants but implies, in its ultimate form, a graft-transmissible signal that, although activated by different stimuli in different flowering systems, {{is common to}} all plants. We show that SFT (SINGLE-FLOWER <b>TRUSS),</b> the <b>tomato</b> ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), induces flowering in day-neutral tomato and tobacco plants and is encoded by SFT. sft tomato mutant plants are late-flowering, with altered architecture and flower morphology. SFT-dependent graft-transmissible signals complement all developmental defects in sft plants and substitute for long-day stimuli in Arabidopsis, short-day stimuli in Maryland Mammoth tobacco, and light-dose requirements in tomato uniflora mutant plants. The absence of donor SFT RNA from flowering receptor shoots and the localization of the protein in leaf nuclei implicate florigen-like messages in tomato as a downstream pathway triggered by cell-autonomous SFT RNA transcripts. Flowering in tomato is synonymous with termination of the shoot apical meristems, and systemic SFT messages attenuate the growth of apical meristems before and independent of floral production. Floral enhancement by systemic SFT signals is therefore one pleiotropic effect of FT orthologs...|$|R
40|$|Recent contradicting {{evidence}} on the contributions of xylem and phloem to tomato fruit growth highlights {{the need for a}} more thorough insight into the dynamics of sap flow through the tomato peduncle. In fact, knowledge on sap flow dynamics through small plant parts remains scarce, {{due to a lack of}} direct measurements. Most currently available sap flow sensors use needles, making them inappropriate for the direct measurement of sap flow through small plant parts such as a tomato peduncle. Therefore, a non-invasive sap flow sensor based on the heat field deformation (HFD) principle was tested on the peduncle of a <b>tomato</b> <b>truss.</b> This mini HFD sensor, consisting of a heater element and three thermocouples stitched on insulation tape, was wrapped around the peduncle and allowed continuous monitoring of changes in the heat field around the heater caused by sap flow. Actual influx into the <b>tomato</b> <b>truss</b> was calculated based on fruit growth data and estimates of fruit transpiration and was compared with the dynamics measured with the mini HFD sensor. Additionally, heat girdling of the peduncle was performed to block phloem influx to study the dynamics of xylem and phloem influx using the mini HFD sensor. First results of the mini HFD sensor were promising and the measured sap flow dynamics through the tomato peduncle agreed well with the calculated sap influx. Results of the girdling experiment suggested opposite patterns of xylem and phloem influx, with a decreased xylem influx during the daytime. Furthermore, the pattern of xylem influx revealed a close relation with the total water potential in the stem. As such, the mini HFD sensor provided direct measurements of sap flow dynamics through a tomato peduncle and, hence, has a large potential to finally resolve the controversy on water influx into developing fruits...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{studies in}} Arabidopsis {{established}} FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) {{as a key}} flower-promoting gene in photoperiodic systems. Grafting experiments established unequivocal one-to-one relations between SFT (SINGLE FLOWER <b>TRUSS),</b> a <b>tomato</b> homolog of FT, and the hypothetical florigen, in all flowering plants. Additional studies of SFT and SP (SELF PRUNING, homolog of TFL 1), two antagonistic genes regulating {{the architecture of the}} sympodial shoot system, have suggested that transition to flowering in the day-neutral and perennial tomato is synonymous with ‘termination’. Dosage manipulation of its endogenous and mobile, graft-transmissible levels demonstrated that florigen regulates termination and transition to flowering in an SP-dependent manner and, by the same token, that high florigen levels induce growth arrest and termination in meristems across the tomato shoot system. It was thus proposed that growth balances, and consequently the patterning of the shoot systems in all plants, are mediated by endogenous, meristem-specific SFT/SP ratios, and that shifts to termination by elevated SFT/SP ratios are triggered by mobile florigen. Florigen is a universal growth plant hormone inherently checked by a complementary antagonistic systemic system. Thus, an examination of the endogenous functions of FT-like genes, or of the systemic roles of the mobile florigen in any plant species, that fails to pay careful attention to the balancing antagonistic systems, or to consider its functions in day-neutral or perennial plants, would be incomplete...|$|R

Taste-related attributes [dry matter content (DM), total soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), glucose, fructose and citric acid content] and health-promoting attributes (lycopene, ß-carotene, vitamin C, and total antioxidant activity) of tomato fruits harvested {{on the vine}} from the fifth or tenth truss positions were determined. The quality of tomato fruits was improved by high EC. A high EC in the root zone increased the DM content, total SSC, TA, as well as glucose, fructose and citric acid contents. A significantly higher lycopene and ß-carotene content was also observed [on a fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) basis] with a high EC in the root zone. The accumulation of different compounds that determine tomato fruit quality differed between the fifth and tenth truss. In particular, the lycopene content was reduced, whereas the ß-carotene content was increased in the tenth truss {{with respect to the}} fifth truss, most likely because of higher temperatures during ripening of the tenth truss. Fruit pruning increased fruit FW by 42 % and positively influenced the DM content and total anti-oxidant activity, while a negative effect was observed on lycopene and citric acid contents (on a FW and DW basis). EC and fruit pruning both had a strong effect on fruit size; however, EC had a much stronger impact on taste and health-related fruit quality attributes.

40|$|The florigen {{paradigm}} {{implies a}} universal flowering-inducing hormone that {{is common to}} all flowering plants. Recent work identified FT orthologues as originators of florigen and their polypeptides as the likely systemic agent. However, the developmental processes targeted by florigen remained unknown. Here we identify local balances between SINGLE FLOWER <b>TRUSS</b> (SFT), the <b>tomato</b> precursor of florigen, and SELF-PRUNING (SP), a potent SFT-dependent SFT inhibitor as prime targets of mobile florigen. The graft-transmissible impacts of florigen on organ-specific traits in perennial tomato show {{that in addition to}} import by shoot apical meristems, florigen is imported by organs in which SFT is already expressed. By modulating local SFT/SP balances, florigen confers differential flowering responses of primary and secondary apical meristems, regulates the reiterative growth and termination cycles typical of perennial plants, accelerates leaf maturation, and influences the complexity of compound leaves, the growth of stems and the formation of abscission zones. Florigen is thus established as a plant protein functioning as a general growth hormone.

Hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) light-grown fruits have stronger assimilate sinks than dark-grown fruits, and (2) responses depend on light treatment provided, and fruit development stage. Seven light treatments [dark, 12 -h white, 24 -h white, 24 -h red and 24 -h blue light, dark in the first 24 days after anthesis (DAA) followed by 24 -h white light until breaker stage, and its reverse] were applied.

The dynamics of greenhouse climate were analyzed using a simple greenhouse climate model (GCM), while the growth and development of a determinate tomato crop were quantified using the INTKAM greenhouse crop simulation model. By combining the GCM and INTKAM models, ways to improve tomato production under tropical lowland greenhouse were investigated. Model calculations were calibrated and validated with experiments in six prototype greenhouses with three different near infrared (NIR) transmissivities during three periods with different tropical lowland climate characteristics. The greenhouses having high natural ventilation capacity showed a climate closely coupled to the outdoor climate. Greenhouse air temperature TAir was affected more by variation in ventilation and leaf area index than by the applied NIR transmission. Simulation shows that lowering TAir can be achieved by: (i) reducing near infrared radiation (NIR) transmission especially for bigger greenhouses and humid conditions, (ii) increasing ventilation openings and (iii) transpiration cooling, especially under hot and dry conditions. GCM study indicated that naturally ventilated model greenhouses of up to size of 14400 m 2 were capable to create TAir close to or lower than outdoor air temperature Tout when the greenhouse crops had leaf area index of higher than 0. 5. Crops with low number of trusses produced substantially lower fruit weight than crops with high number of <b>trusses.</b> Determinate <b>tomato</b> clearly exhibit high fruit abortion, with the number of fruits per truss decreasing as truss number increases. This partly can be explained by low source – sink strength ratio during the productive period. Effort to increase tomato production might require adequate crop management aimed at finding the appropriate source – sink balance. Scenario studies revealed that fruit production by a determinate tomato crop can be increased slightly by using zero NIR transmittance plastic film and by planting three crops per year (which is current practice). However, when the number of fruits can be maintained constant through appropriate crop management measures, the production would increase with increasing fruit load and the lengthening production period through fewer plantings per year.  ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant {{architecture}} {{and the timing}} and distribution of reproductive structures are fundamental agronomic traits shaped by patterns of determinate and indeterminate growth. Florigen, encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and SINGLE FLOWER <b>TRUSS</b> (SFT) in <b>tomato,</b> acts as a general growth hormone, advancing determinate growth. Domestication of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) converted it from a lanky photoperiodic perennial to a highly inbred, compact day-neutral plant that is managed as an annual row-crop. This dramatic change in plant architecture provides {{a unique opportunity to}} analyze the transition from perennial to annual growth. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore these architectural changes, we addressed the role of day-length upon flowering in an ancestral, perennial accession and in a domesticated variety of cotton. Using a disarmed Cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCrV) as a transient expression system, we delivered FT to both cotton accessions. Ectopic expression of FT in ancestral cotton mimicked the effects of day-length, promoting photoperiod-independent flowering, precocious determinate architecture, and lanceolate leaf shape. Domesticated cotton infected with FT demonstrated more synchronized fruiting and enhanced "annualization". Transient expression of FT also facilitated simple crosses between wild photoperiodic and domesticated day-neutral accessions, effectively demonstrating a mechanism to increase genetic diversity among cultivated lines of cotton. Virus was not detected in the F(1) progeny, indicating that crosses made by this approach do not harbor recombinant DNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend our understanding of FT as a general growth hormone that regulates shoot architecture by advancing organ-specific and age-related determinate growth. Judicious manipulation of FT could benefit cotton architecture to improve crop management...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate {{the potential of the}} single <b>truss</b> system of <b>tomato</b> production to produce high yields of quality fruit under New Zealand conditions. The NFT hydroponic system was used to grow the plants so that nutrient solution conductivity could be maintained close to predetermined levels. In the first experiment three cultivars were compared. At the time of fruit set of the first truss four conductivity treatments (2, 4, 6 and 8 mS cm- 1) were applied. Yield and fruit quality data was obtained from each of six crops over an 18 month period. Yield (fruit size) decreased with increasing conductivity for all three cultivars. Season also had a significant effect on yield, with an April harvested crop having the highest yield. Both fruit brix and titratable acidity were increased at the higher conductivity levels. There were also cultivar and seasonal differences in fruit quality, with the cherry cultivar 'Cherita' consistently producing the highest brix and titratable acidity levels. Brix levels were found to be low in the December harvested crop, while acidity was highest in the December, April and July harvested crops. Season, solution conductivity and cultivar influenced plant leaf area and leaf area index. Solution conductivity also effected foliar mineral levels, as did cultivar. Three successive multi truss crops were grown in a pumice media system to provide fruit quality data for sensory evaluation and comparison with single truss and commercial compositional fruit quality. The same three cultivars as were compared in the single truss crop experiment were grown at three conductivity levels (2, 4 and 6 mS cm- 1) applied at the time of fruit set of the first truss. Fruit samples were taken from the 5 th and 6 th trusses for quality evaluation. Season and solution conductivity had an effect on fruit dry matter percentage and brix. Fruit shelf life was affected by season, conductivity and cultivar, with a longer shelf life obtained from fruit grown at the higher conductivity levels. The December harvested crop had the lowest overall shelf life. Fruit firmness was only affected by solution conductivity, with the fruit from the higher conductivity treatments being firmest. Sensory evaluation of Rondello fruit on three separate occasions showed that the higher conductivity treatment scored highest for most attributes, and that these sensory scores correlated well with brix and titratable acidity levels. A second single truss crop experiment focused on manipulation of the source/sink relationship (fruit and leaf number combinations) of three successional crops and the effect of spring and winter CO 2 enrichment on two of the three crops. The summer crop also evaluated the effect of crop shading and source/sink relationship on fruit yield, as high fruit temperatures were suspected to have reduced yield in the previous summer single truss crops. Yield and fruit quality data was collected from all three crops, along with fruit and environmental temperature recordings from the summer crop. It was found that season and fruit number effected yield, with the 8 fruit per plant treatment resulting in the greatest yield. Leaf number (either 2 or 3) and season affected fruit dry matter percentage, brix and leaf area, while fruit number influenced brix levels. CO 2 enrichment (1000 ppm) had no effect on either spring or winter fruit yield, but did advance crop maturity allowing an extra crop per year to be produced. Thus yearly yield was increased by CO 2 enrichment. CO 2 enrichment improved fruit quality in the spring crop, but had no effect on the winter crop. Shading of the summer crop resulted in an increase of 10 % in total fruit yield and 19 % in marketable fruit yield, due to the presence of smaller fruit and heat induced ripening disorders in the unshaded crop. Both leaf number and shading treatments affected titratable acidity, with unshaded fruit having greater percent citric acid levels. Shelf life and fruit firmness was greater in the shaded crop. Air, canopy and fruit temperatures were reduced under shade, with exposed fruit often reaching extreme temperatures (above 40 °C). Having established that leaf and fruit temperatures were reaching extreme levels during the summer in a single truss cropping situation, the effect of these temperatures on photosynthesis and fruit respiration was examined. The effect of leaf age on photosynthesis was also examined as single truss plants do not continue to produce young foliage to maintain photosynthesis levels. After harvest, net photosynthesis and the light compensation point, which had been increasing began to fall rapidly at all light levels. It was found that after an initial drop as leaves matured, leaf age did not effect net photosynthesis. Plants exposed to 800 PAR showed maximum net photosynthesis at temperatures between 25 – 27 °C. Net photosynthesis ceased at 43 °C. Fruit truss respiration rates were determined at 4 temperatures (25, 30, 35 and 40 °C), on 3 occasions (18, 26, 36 and 40 days after fruit set). 5 different tissue sample combinations were assessed comprising, the whole truss with sealed and unsealed cut surfaces, fruit only with sealed and unsealed calyx scar and calyx, peduncles and plant stem only. It was found that temperature, truss portion assessed and stage of fruit maturity all affect fruit respiration rate, with the fruit only (calyx scar unsealed) resulting in the greatest CO 2 efflux. It was concluded that while the fruit epidermis is relatively impermeable to gas escape, the main route for Co 2 is through the calyx scar. Mature green fruit had the greatest response of increased CO 2 production with increasing temperature, while temperatures above 25 °C disrupted the climacteric pattern of CO 2 evolution. It was concluded that in single truss plants, when temperatures were above 30 °C, net photosynthesis is reduced, while fruit respiration begins to increase rapidly, both responses having a detrimental effect on yield. The single truss system was shown to produce yields and fruit quality equal to those of good multi <b>truss</b> commercial <b>tomato</b> producers in New Zealand. This was achieved by CO 2 enrichment for crop advancement and summer crop shading, while moderate levels of solution conductivity produced good quality fruit. However, there is the possibility of further improving these yields by utilisation of other technologies such as a movable bench system and manipulation of plant density, timing of conductivity application, and different cultivars. The potential of this system for high quality, high yielding tomato fruit production warrants commercial evaluation...|$|R

The theoretical framework that describes its basic properties {{has been in}} place for almost a century, {{yet at the same time}} only little is known about the dynamics of long distance transport inside the living plant. The latter is caused by the fact that the two pathways in which transport takes place, the xylem and the phloem, are virtually inaccessible to invasive experimentation. As a result a wide range of questions about the dynamics of long distance transport have yet to be answered. Examples of such questions, as addressed in this study, are: how fast does phloem sap move; how variable is the phloem sap flow velocity between species and over the diurnal cycle; what percentage of the potential flow conducting area in xylem tissue is functional. Or with regard to fruits: what percentage of the influx to fruits occurs through the xylem, what percentage through the phloem; does the xylem remain functional throughout fruit development; and does backflow from the fruit to the plant occur. Here, we show that NMR flow imaging provides a non-invasive and quantitative means to answer these intriguing questions. In order to be able to compare the results from different plants, the flow imaging data need to be independent from anatomical characteristics such as conduit diameter. To quantify flow, the signal from a known quantity of water in a reference object is compared with the signal from flowing water in the plant. When the NMR signals arising from the flowing water in the plant and that of the reference object have different relaxation rates, quantification problems may arise. In porous materials relaxation is influenced by pore diameter. Correspondingly, the relaxation of flowing water in plants will be influenced by conduit diameter. We developed a T 2 resolved flow imaging method to measure the T 2 relaxation behaviour of the flowing water (chapter 2), and used it to determine how xylem conduit diameter affects T 2 relaxation. Furthermore, we investigated whether conduit diameter dependent T 2 changes need to be corrected for when quantifying results of NMR flow imaging (chapter 3). We found that conduit diameter indeed affected the T 2 of the flowing water. However, because the effects were relatively small, T 2 resolved flow imaging was not needed to correct for conduit diameter induced changes in T 2. Standard, non flow resolved T 2 imaging sufficed. The accuracy of the quantification of volume flow in the xylem in all cases was ± 10 % or better. The T 2 resolved flow imaging sequence that was developed will be of interest for research that deals with liquids moving through microscopic conduits, such as porous media, bioreactors, and biomats. With regard to the dynamics and basic properties of xylem and phloem transport, three subjects are taken into account: xylem transport, phloem transport, and long distance transport to fruits. For the xylem, one of the questions to be solved is how much of the potential flow conducting area that is present in the xylem anatomy, is in reality used to conduct flow. Xylem tissue consists of many conduits of varying diameters, ranging from small to large. We investigated the relationship between xylem conduit diameter distribution and flow conducting area in stems of various plant species (chapter 3), and the relation between the diurnal dynamics of xylem sap flow and the flow conducting area (chapter 4). We found that in the stems with the widest conduits only a small proportion of the potential flow conducting area conducted flow (as low as 31 %). In stems that only possessed narrow conduits, a much larger part of the total xylem conduit cross sectional area conducted flow (up to 86 %). We conclude that when wide conduits are present and are functional, the role of the narrowest conduits in terms of the conductance of water is almost negligible. Secondly, we found that the flow conducting area does not stay constant throughout the diurnal cycle. Decreases in xylem flux at night were accompanied by a decrease in velocity, but also by a decrease in flow-conducting area. It is well known that plant stems exhibit a diurnal pattern of shrinkage and expansion due to changes in xylem pressure. However, the diurnal changes in the flow conducting area were opposite to the changes in stem diameter and thus could not be explained by pressure dependent elastic changes in conduit diameter. With regard to the phloem we investigated the following questions: how fast does phloem sap move, how variable is the sap flow velocity between species and over the diurnal cycle; and what percentage of the shoot-bound xylem sap is returned to the root system by means of the phloem (chapter 4). Furthermore we investigated how phloem volume flow responds to local cooling (chapter 6). We compared the diurnal phloem and xylem flow dynamics in poplar, tomato, castor bean, and tobacco. In contrast to the highly variable sap flow velocities in the xylem, the sap flow velocities in the phloem remained very constant throughout the diurnal cycle. The differences in the average phloem flow velocity between the four species also were remarkably small (0. 25 - 0. 40 mm/s). We hypothesize that upper and lower bounds for phloem flow velocity may exist: when phloem flow velocity is too high, wall bound (parietal) organelles may be stripped away from sieve tube walls; when sap flow is too slow or is highly variable, phloem borne signalling could become unpredictable. The phloem to xylem volume flow ratio reflects the amount of xylem water that within the plant is (re) used for phloem transport. It may be indicative for the water use efficiency of a plant. This ratio was surprisingly large at night for poplar, castor bean and tobacco (ranging from 0. 19 for poplar to 0. 55 in tobacco), but as low as 0. 04 in tomato. With regard to long distance transport to fruits we investigated three long-standing questions: how much of the influx into the fruit occurs by means of the xylem, and how much by means of the phloem; does the xylem remain functional throughout fruit development; and does backflow from the fruit to the plant occur. As a model system we used a <b>tomato</b> <b>truss.</b> We found that xylem transport into the truss remained functional throughout the full 8 weeks of truss growth. During that period at least 75 % of the net influx occurred through the xylem, and about 25 % through a region that contains both internal phloem and internal xylem (perimedullary region). These results contradict earlier estimates that were made on the basis of indirect measurements. Halfway during truss development a xylem backflow to the plant appeared. However, the influx volume always was larger, implying that there was no net loss of water from the truss to the plant. Interestingly a circulation of xylem sap in the truss stalk remained even after the fruits were removed, probably caused by pressure gradients originating from the main stem. During the experiment about half of the cumulative net influx into the truss was lost to the air due to evaporation. Because of the extreme sensitivity of xylem and phloem to invasive experimentation, only little is known about the dynamics of long distance transport in the living plant. The fact that the exploratory NMR flow imaging experiments in this study swiftly turned up a number of surprises with regard to the dynamics of flow underscores this observation. We found indications that phloem flow velocity is much more constant in nature than previously assumed, over the course of a day as well as between species. We observed that, depending on the species, at night a significant amount of xylem water can be recycled by means of the phloem, thus helping to maintain xylem circulation during periods of low transpiration. With regard to long distance transport to fruits, we found that during <b>truss</b> growth in <b>tomato</b> the majority of water influx does not occur by means of the phloem, but through the xylem. These results illustrate that the dynamics of xylem and phloem sap flow in the living plant are far from being understood, but also that NMR flow imaging provides an excellent non-invasive tool to help elucidate it...|$|R
