5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> this support.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Provence {{experienced}} {{a boom in}} sericulture that would last until the first world war, {{with much of the}} silk shipped north to Lyon. Viens and La Bastide-des-Jourdans are two of the communes of Luberon that profited <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> mulberry plantations that have since disappeared. However, silk centers still operate today.Working at home under the domestic system, silk spinning and silk treatment employed many people and increased the income of the working class.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} draft, the Falcons had two picks {{in the first}} round. These {{selections}} were Tommy Nobis, a linebacker from Texas, and Randy Johnson, a quarterback from Texas A. The Falcons have selected number one overall four times: Tommy Nobis, Steve Bartkowski, Aundray Bruce, and Michael Vick. The team has also selected number two overall three times and number three overall two times. The Falcons have selected players from Florida State University four times, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> any university. The team's most recent first-round selection was Keanu Neal, a strong safety from the University of Florida.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} side of the field, Air Force had the No. 2 rushing offense in the country during the 1984 regular season. Air Force fullback Pat Evans led the team with 159carries for 1,015rushing yards. Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss also was known more for his running than his passing. Weiss {{finished}} the regular season with just 41completions for 668yards and threetouchdowns. He carried the ball 126times for 540yards and 10touchdowns. Wide receiver Ken Carpenter benefited <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> the few passes that were thrown. He had 15catches for 258yards and twotouchdowns during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Several {{teaching}} {{guides and}} books of study notes {{have been published}} to help teachers and students gain <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> the book. The Hobbit introduces literary concepts, notably allegory, to young readers, as the work has been seen to have allegorical aspects reflecting {{the life and times}} of the author. Meanwhile, the author himself rejected an allegorical reading of his work. This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of New Criticism, and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as sublimation, in approaching literary works.|$|E
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial {{to them in}} terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than any other type of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September, IV Corps began {{operations}} {{designed to}} capture Bancourt Ridge {{and allow the}} advance to continue. Under the cover of an artillery barrage, the 42nd Division, New Zealand Division, and 5th Division, {{from right to left}} respectively, would begin advancing at 4:55 am. As had frequently happened during the battle, the New Zealanders found themselves ahead of the flanking divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade swiftly made the crest of the ridge, taking 70 prisoners. The 1st Infantry Brigade was a little slower; the 1st Wellington Battalion made the crest and consolidated itself there. The other battalion, 2nd Auckland, despite the assistance of two tanks, was unable to do the same. Operating on the extreme flank of the New Zealand Division's sector of the front, it suffered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> the lack of progress of the 42nd Division and was unable hold its portion of the crest. That evening, the 2nd Infantry Brigade moved into the line, replacing both the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E

25|$|Poor {{whites and}} landless former slaves {{suffered}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed {{a committee to}} recommend what was needed for relief {{of the state and}} its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes. It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.|$|E
25|$|Zoey (Miles?): A baby {{orangutan}} who {{was brought}} into the Miles' family after being rejected by her mother. Zoey is very playful and curious, which is the biggest reason she gets into tight, and sometimes near fatal, situations. Having an aggravating tendency to rip things apart (mainly Molly's homework), throw food around, and trash anything she comes across, {{she has to be}} carefully monitored {{as if she were a}} human toddler. She once swallowed an entire bottle of shampoo and became seriously dehydrated, which caused Molly to rush her to a hospital in order to keep her from dying. This act has probably led to Zoey bonding strongly with Molly and learning <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> her.|$|E

25|$|Eight {{members of}} the Chicago Bears were {{selected}} {{to play in the}} 2007 Pro Bowl. Olin Kreutz, Tommie Harris, Lance Briggs, Brian Urlacher, Robbie Gould, Devin Hester, and Brendon Ayanbadejo were selected by NFL fans throughout the nation to represent the Bears. The eight selections were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> any team in the NFC. The Bears had not sent that many players to Honolulu since the 1986 Pro Bowl, which succeeded the 1985 NFL season, when they sent nine. On January 25, Bears' left guard Ruben Brown was named to his ninth Pro Bowl, taking the spot of injured Shawn Andrews of the Philadelphia Eagles. However, Harris, Urlacher, Kreutz, and Briggs missed the Pro Bowl on the account of injuries.|$|E
25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that older adults will benefit <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E
25|$|Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) {{have been}} agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN nation after the AEC goes into effect on 31 December 2015. Applicants must be {{licensed}} and recognised professionals in these fields in their home countries. They can move to other ASEAN countries to practice, but they must pass that country's licensing test. In Thailand, licensing tests {{will be in the}} Thai language. In addition, one cannot be an independent practitioner. Any foreign professional intending to work must collaborate with a local business. Given these hurdles, it is unlikely that there will be significant migrations of professionals in the near-term. A Chulalongkorn University study predicts that more developed countries stand to benefit <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>from</b> the free flow of professionals.|$|E
