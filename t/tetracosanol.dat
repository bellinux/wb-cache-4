40|$|Background: Polycosanols {{derived from}} plant species have {{traditionally}} been used in medicine as antiproliferative agents for treating various viruses (primarily the herpes simplex virus). However, few studies have studied their effects on hyperproliferative cell lines. In this work, the antiproliferative capacity of polycosanols from tall-oil pitch, obtained from black liquor soaps in the kraft pulping process of cellulose (specifically from Pinus radiata, Pinus taede, and Eucalyptus globulus), was evaluated on CHO-K 1 and CRL- 1974 human melanoma cell lines. Results: The proliferative capacities and cell viabilities were measured for 72 and 140  h, respectively. Treatment with docosanol produced differential effects on the CHO-K 1 and human melanoma cells and significantly affected their proliferation rates, but not their cell viabilities. <b>Tetracosanol</b> produced a significant {{negative effect on the}} proliferation of human melanoma cells, and this effect was less than that caused by docosanol. However, it had no effect on the proliferation of CHO-K 1 cells and did not induce any significant effect on the viability of the studied cell lines. Conclusion: Docosanol and <b>tetracosanol</b> induced antiproliferative effects on the studied cell lines and exhibited significantly greater effects on the oncogenic cell lines. Prior to this study, the capacity of these polycosanols has never been investigated. Future studies will be necessary to determine their mechanisms of action on these cell systems...|$|E
40|$|Faraday surface {{instability}} {{measurements of the}} critical acceleration, a_c, and wavenumber, k_c, for standing surface waves on a <b>tetracosanol</b> (C_ 24 H_ 50) melt exhibit abrupt changes at T_s= 54 degC above the bulk freezing temperature. The measured variations of a_c and k_c vs. temperature and driving frequency are accounted for quantitatively by a hydrodynamic model, revealing a change from a free-slip surface flow, generic for a free liquid surface (T>T_s), to a surface-pinned, no-slip flow, characteristic of a flow near a wetted solid wall (T < T_s). The change at T_s is traced to the onset of surface freezing, where the steep velocity gradient in the surface-pinned flow significantly increases the viscous dissipation near the surface.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{reported}} {{for the first time}} the evolution of some minor compounds (sterols and aliphatic alcohols) composition of four Algerian olive oils according to the cultivar and the maturity stage during the season (2013 / 2014). Olive samples were collected during eight different harvesting dates. The studied cultivars were Chemlal, Aghenfas, Buichret and Mekki. Ten sterolic compounds, triterpene dialcohols (erythrodiol[*]+[*]uvaol) and seven fatty alcohols were identified and characterized. The results showed a decreasing level of total sterols, β-sitosterol, triterpenic dialcohols, total aliphatic alcohols, <b>tetracosanol</b> (C 24), and an increasing level of Δ 5 -avenasterol according to the maturity process. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) enabled the classification of the studied varieties on the basis of analytical data and a correct classification rate of 96. 5 % and 88. 6 % was achieved using the original and cross validation method respectively. The most discriminating variables have been: cholesterol, campestanol, Δ 7 -stigmastenol, Δ 7 -avenasterol, clerosterol, alcohol C 22, alcohol C 25, alcohol C 27...|$|E
40|$|Salicornia ramosissima J. Woods is considered, in the Iberian Peninsula and France, {{a gourmet}} product. Nevertheless, {{is one of}} the less studied Salicornia species. In this work, GC-MS was {{employed}} to, for the first time; fully characterise the lipophilic profile of S. ramosissima and to assess the effect of natural and extra irrigation in that profile. The obtained data showed esterified and free fatty acids, fatty alcohol, sterols, alkanes and aromatic acid derivatives, being palmitic acid, <b>tetracosanol</b> and octacosanol the most abundant compounds. The extra irrigation increases significantly (P < 0. 001) the content of esterified lipophilic compounds. Stigmastanol, 24 -ethyl-δ(22) -coprostenol, several secondary fatty alcohols and dicarboxylic acids were identified {{for the first time in}} Salicornia genus. Several of the detected compounds are known to have health benefits and our results suggest that S. ramosissima should be considered as an important dietary source of lipophilic phytochemicals.

40|$|Pomace {{olive oil}} is a {{by-product}} of olive oil extraction that is traditionally produced and consumed in Spain. The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain fatty alcohols, which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain fatty alcohols were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of pomace olive oil, and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain fatty alcohols were <b>tetracosanol,</b> hexacosanol and octacosanol. We investigated the ability of long-chain fatty alcohols from pomace olive oil to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain fatty alcohols significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain fatty alcohols also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcohols significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain fatty alcohols, reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml. These results showed that long-chain fatty alcohols may have a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development, suggesting its potential value as a putative functional component of pomace olive oil.
