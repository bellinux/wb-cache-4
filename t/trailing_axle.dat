25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E
25|$|Engine no. 9 {{remained}} in service in Cape Town {{until late in}} 1873. In October 1873, the Chief Inspector of Public Works requested a locomotive for use at the Kowie harbour project in Port Alfred and, on 24 December, authority was granted for alterations {{to be made to}} the locomotive and for it to be shipped to Port Alfred. It is probable that these alterations included the addition of a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{preservation}} {{group is}} engaged in a project to construct a Victorian Railways N class. A feasibility study has been conducted for the N441 Steam Locomotive Project to investigate the viability of converting a K class frame into that of a 1st series Victorian Railways N class, using locomotive K 154's frames and wheels together with one of the remaining spare N class boilers, and constructing a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> with components acquired from a number of state heritage assets.|$|E
50|$|Most early {{electric}} locomotives shared commonalities with the steam engines of their time. These features included side rods and frame mounted driving axles with leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>axles.</b> The long rigid wheelbase and the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>axles</b> reduced cornering stability and increased weight.|$|R

25|$|A type long-familiar on French {{railways}} was the 4-cylinder de Glehn compound. The prototype, Nord 701, was a 2-2-2-0 {{designed by}} Alfred de Glehn, an {{engineer at the}} Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM), and ordered by Gaston du Bousquet, chief engineer of the Nord Railway. It had a 4-cylinder layout with the driving wheels uncoupled, and bore a superficial resemblance to a Webb compound, except that inside HP cylinders drove the leading driving axle whilst the LP cylinders were outside, driving the <b>trailing</b> <b>axle.</b> In 1891 two production locomotives, Nord 2.121 and 2.122, were placed in service with the cylinder positions inverted at du Bousquet's insistence, that is outside HP and inside LP, one of which initially had uncoupled driving axles as before but this arrangement proved inferior to the coupled version.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} based on a 4-4-0 design with a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> added to support an {{enlarged}} coal bunker, a necessity for the intensive suburban services of the LSWR network. The radial axlebox worked in a corresponding curved hornblock the centre of which was struck near the middle of the chassis. The device was originally invented in 1863 by William Bridges Adams (no relation) and could be applied to a leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> but was generally preferred for the latter. Many other engineers used it, including Webb, R. J. Billinton, H. G. Ivatt, and D.E. Marsh. Many of the tank engines so fitted earned the soubriquet [...] "Radial Tanks", or simply [...] "Radials".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{locomotives}} {{were one}} 2-2-0 built by Charles Tayleur and Company and three by William Marshall of Gravesend, of {{which one was}} 2-2-2. All {{would appear to be}} of the Stephenson [...] "Planet" [...] type. These were supplemented by two from Bury, subcontracted to George Forrester and Company. For the first time horizontal cylinders were mounted {{at the front of the}} locomotive outside the frame. While extremely successful for their time, they swayed so much they were referred to as [...] "Boxers" [...] and a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> was added. In the next four years three more locos followed, one each by R and W Hawthorn and Robert Stephenson and Company, with three axles, and one by Day, Summers and Company. This latter one was modified with a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> soon after delivery.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 Fraunhofer IVI {{introduced}} the AutoTram Extra Grand in Dresden. With overall length of 30.73 m {{it is the}} longest bus in service with a passenger capacity of 256. Its unique 5-axle design is made possible using advanced computer controlled steering on the 3 <b>trailing</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bo-Bo {{configuration}} {{allowed for}} higher cornering speeds {{due to the}} smaller rigid wheelbase. Furthermore, it allowed better adhesion because all the wheels were now powered. Due {{to the absence of}} frame mounted wheels no leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>axles</b> were necessary to aid cornering, reducing weight and maintenance requirements.|$|R
50|$|The Moga class {{locomotives}} were tank locomotives {{with one}} leading <b>axle</b> and three <b>trailing</b> <b>axles,</b> carrying water and coal without a tender. The axle load {{is estimated to}} have been around 5 tons per axle. It was quickly found insufficient, and no further locomotives of the same wheel arrangement were introduced.|$|R
2500|$|Despite this, in 1903 the inextricable link {{was made}} between the class and the {{severely}} curved Lyme Regis branch. Unsuccessful trials were carried out with the Stroudley Terriers and the Adams O2 class; however with the <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> modified the flexible 0415 class tanks proved to be highly suited to the operating conditions of that line.|$|E
2500|$|The TACR2 was a six-wheeled Range Rover-based {{successor}} to the TACR1. Its designation stands for Truck Fire-Fighting Airfield Crash Rescue 2 Tonne 6x4 Mark 2. It {{was designed as a}} rapid response vehicle used by the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and various British fire brigades. It was built by Carmichael, Gloster Saro and HCB Angus. It is permanent four wheel drive and the <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> was originally unpowered. Some TACR2s have been converted to six wheel drive. [...] After their service life ended, some were transferred to regional or airport fire service.|$|E

50|$|Standard {{practice}} in the United Kingdom was to use the Whyte notation for steam locomotives. The Southern Railway used a system modified from the UIC method: Oliver Bulleid, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, numbered his 4-6-2 Battle of Britain class Pacifics 21C XXX, referring to leading <b>axles,</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>axles</b> and powered axles, UIC classification 2′C1′, Whyte 4-6-2.|$|R
50|$|In UIC {{notation}} this wheel arrangement {{could be}} described as a 2′C1′1′ (or more fully, 2′C1′1′h4vS) as the two <b>trailing</b> <b>axles</b> were independent, rather than a four-wheeled bogie as for those leading. The forward axle was {{similar to that of the}} pacifics, having outside frames and Cartazzi axleboxes. The rear axle was an inside-framed Bissel truck, pivoted ahead of the leading axle.|$|R
5000|$|A Superdump is a {{straight}} dump truck {{equipped with a}} <b>trailing</b> <b>axle,</b> a liftable, load-bearing axle rated as high as 13000 lb. Trailing 11 to 13 ft behind the rear tandem, the <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> stretches the outer [...] "bridge" [...] measurement—the distance {{between the first and}} last axles—to the maximum overall length allowed. This increases the gross weight allowed under the federal bridge formula, which sets standards for truck size and weight. Depending on the vehicle length and axle configuration, Superdumps can be rated as high as 80000 lb. GVW and carry 26 ST of payload or more. When the truck is empty or ready to offload, the <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> toggles up off the road surface on two hydraulic arms to clear the rear of the vehicle. Truck owners call their trailing axle-equipped trucks Superdumps because they far exceed the payload, productivity, and return on investment of a conventional dump truck. The Superdump and <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> concept was developed by Strong Industries of Houston, Texas.|$|E
50|$|The {{coupled axles}} were {{fixed to the}} frame. The leading bogie was an Erfurt design, the <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> was an Adams axle.|$|E

5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>axles).</b> The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|R
50|$|Under the Whyte notation, a 2-8-4 is a steam {{locomotive}} that has one unpowered leading axle, {{usually in a}} leading truck, followed by four powered and coupled driving axles, and two unpowered <b>trailing</b> <b>axles,</b> usually mounted in a bogie. This locomotive type is most {{often referred to as}} a Berkshire, though the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway used the name Kanawha for their 2-8-4s. In Europe, this wheel arrangement was mostly seen in mainline passenger express locomotives and, in certain countries, in tank locomotives.|$|R

50|$|In the {{notation}} a locomotive with two leading axles (four wheels) in front, then three driving axles (six wheels) {{and then one}} <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> (two wheels) is classified as 4-6-2.|$|E
50|$|The Bissel or pony {{axle design}} is {{commonly}} used on steam locomotives with a single leading or <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> and was later also used on the Class 4E electric and Classes 32-000 and 32-200 diesel-electric locomotives.|$|E

50|$|At {{a general}} meeting in November, {{shareholders}} {{were informed that}} Gouin had used inferior iron on the rocking shafts, rather than first grade iron or forged steel as specified, and the shafts therefore had failed in the test. Also the <b>trailing</b> <b>axles</b> could not accommodate the tight curves {{and would have to}} be removed. This meant that the rear driving wheels would need additional bearings and springs. On 17 April 1868 the Times reported that seven locomotives had had their shafts replaced or shortly would do.|$|R
50|$|These six {{locomotives}} {{were very}} similar in appearance to the earlier Clara Class, but could be visually identified by their steam domes which were located further forward, closer to their chimneys, {{as well as by}} the different shape of the cutaway at the rear of their frames above their <b>trailing</b> <b>axles.</b> They were named Scotia, Hibernia, Cambria, Canada, Australia and India respectively and were also numbered, in the range from 8 to 10, 12, 14 and 15. They were later described as the Scotia Class.|$|R
50|$|On HULDA the firebox {{extended}} {{under the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> {{by means of}} a sloping base in order to achieve the greatest possible grate area. Apart from MARSCHALL VORWÄRTS which had a conical chimney, all the engines had long cylindrical smokestacks.|$|E
50|$|The locomotives, {{which were}} built by Krauss {{were similar to}} the Class D VIII, but were smaller and lighter. Like the D VIII they had a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle,</b> that was {{connected}} to the final coupled axle by a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie.|$|E
5000|$|Its engines were {{generally}} of the Stephenson [...] "Planet" [...] type. A further 2-2-0 {{was built in}} 1839 for the London and Greenwich Railway. This was modified soon after delivery {{by the addition of}} a <b>trailing</b> <b>axle</b> making it 2-2-2.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rebuilding}} process {{involved the}} removal of the side water tanks, the rear coal bunker and the <b>trailing</b> <b>axles.</b> [...] In featuring similar components to the U class, the U1 was similar in profile, although a slab-front was incorporated above the front buffer beam to house the third cylinder and associated valve gear assembly between the frames. Nevertheless, the U1 retained the [...] driving wheels and general cab layout of the U class, and the Maunsell [...] tender previously used on the N class locomotives, with No. A890 entering revenue-earning service in June 1928.|$|R
50|$|The three {{coupled axles}} were fixed in the frame. The leading bogie had a side play of 38 mm, the <b>trailing</b> Adams <b>axle</b> could swing 60 mm to the side.|$|R
500|$|The {{rebuilding}} programme {{that followed}} the derailment of K class No. A800 [...] "River Cray" [...] at Sevenoaks began at Ashford works in June 1928. The work involved in converting a 2-6-4 tank engine to a 2-6-0 tender locomotive included {{the removal of the}} side water tanks, rear coal bunker and <b>trailing</b> <b>axles,</b> although the 6ft (1.83 m) driving wheels, right-hand drive and N class–type boiler were retained. The aesthetic aspects inherited from the K class were the former Midland Railway engineer James Clayton’s contributions to the design, creating a simple, functional locomotive similar to the N class.|$|R
