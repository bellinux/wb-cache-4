2500|$|Of the 257 ships sunk by {{submarines}} from World War I convoys, {{only five}} were lost while aircraft assisted the surface escort. On 26 December 1917, as an airship was escorting three merchantmen out of Falmouth for their rendezvous with a convoy, they were attacked {{three times in}} the space of 90 minutes, torpedoing and sinking two of the vessels and narrowling missing the third before escaping. The airship had been [...] away {{at the time of the}} incident, which was one of the last of its kind. In 1918, U-boats attacked convoys escorted by both surface ships and aircraft only six times, sinking three ships in total out of thousands. Because of the decentralised nature of the convoy system, the RNAS had no say in the composition or use of air escorts. The northeast of England led the way in the use of aircraft for short- and long-range escort duty, but shore-based aerial [...] "hunting patrols" [...] were widely considered a superior use of air resources. Subsequent historians have not agreed, although they have tended <b>to</b> <b>overstress</b> the actual use made of aircraft in convoy escort duty. An Admiralty staff study in 1957 concluded that the convoy was the best defence against enemy attacks on shipping, and dismissed shore-based patrols while commending the use of air support in convoying.|$|E

5000|$|Ice-related issues: In {{freezing}} waters, {{floating ice}} features often drift into shallower waters, and their keel comes {{into contact with}} the seabed. As they continue to drift, they gouge the seabed and can hit the pipeline. Stamukhi can also damage this structure, either by exerting high local stresses on it or by causing to soil around it to fail, thereby inducing excessive bending. Strudel are another pipeline hazard in cold waters - water gushing through them can remove the soil from below the structure, making it vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>overstress</b> (due to self-weight) or vortex-induced oscillations.

5000|$|One {{objection}} raised against {{flight envelope}} protection is {{the incident that}} happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a Boeing 747SP-09, northwest of San Francisco in 1985. In this flight incident, the crew was forced <b>to</b> <b>overstress</b> (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a roll and near-vertical dive. (This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the autopilot and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine flame-out). The pilot recovered control with about 10,000 ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise). But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits. If the aircraft had a flight envelope protection system, this recovery {{could not have been}} performed. Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 [...] "never would have fallen out of the airin the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine".|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the railway, {{locomotives}} were built with more and more axles in order the meet the increasingly heavy loads of goods trains. In order not <b>to</b> <b>overstress</b> the tracks, axle loads were often restricted, initially to 16 tonnes, occasionally to 18 tonnes and later usually to 20 tonnes. A ten-coupled locomotive had to weigh no more than 100 tonnes plus whatever tonnage the leading and trailing wheels could support. The heavier a locomotive is, the more surface pressure it places on the wheels and the more it can haul. But as more and more axles are added, curve running becomes increasingly difficult. So early on, work began to develop multi-part frames and bogies which linked sets of axles to their own drive. However driving wheels within bogies using steam was a difficult task due to the moving seals that were required. As a result, a different avenue of development was pursued, whereby a degree of smooth curve running could be achieved using a long, rigid frame through the use, for example, of axles that had sufficient sideways play. The Gölsdorf axle system avoided the need for complicated construction methods like that of Mallet locomotives. It was in effect an artifice enabling locomotives to retain a long, rigid frame (without articulation or bogies), yet whose individual axles could be better aligned when curve running.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the three geometrical aspects of truing, the overall tension of the spokes is significant to the wheel's fatigue durability, stiffness, and ability to absorb shock. Too little tension leads to a rim that is easily deformed by impact with rough terrain. Too much tension leads <b>to</b> <b>overstressed</b> spokes which have a short life. Spoke tensiometers are tools which measure the tension in a spoke. Another common method for making rough estimates of spoke tension involves plucking the spokes {{and listening to the}} audible tone of the vibrating spoke. The optimum tension depends on the spoke length and spoke gauge (diameter). Tables are available online which list tensions for each spoke length, either in terms of absolute physical tension, or notes on the musical scale which coincide with the approximate tension to which the spoke should be tuned. It should be noted that in the real world, a properly trued wheel will not, in general, have a uniform tension across all spokes, due to variation among the parts from which the wheel is made.|$|R
