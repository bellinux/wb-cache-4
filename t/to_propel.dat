5|$|Ballard is a {{wheelchair}} racing athlete, competing mainly in category T53 sprint events. Compared to T54 athletes, she has less {{use of her}} abdominal muscles, which means she cannot raise herself as much in her wheelchair {{to get the best}} angle <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> herself forward.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mukerji played leading roles in the social drama Mehndi (1998) and the comedy Hello Brother (1999). Both these films were {{critical}} and commercial disappointments which failed <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> her career forward.|$|E
5|$|The Mark 50 torpedo stored {{chemical}} energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas, which is sprayed over {{a block of}} solid lithium. The reaction generates heat, creating steam <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the torpedo in a closed Rankine cycle.|$|E

5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as it was hard work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot pedals <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|Syracuse's Mike Leveille scored five goals, {{including}} a goal with 3:00 {{remaining in the}} game to send the game into overtime, and the eventual game-winner in the second overtime period <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the Orange into the Championship game. Syracuse's come-from-behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest.|$|E
5|$|After {{a poignant}} attempt at radio {{communication}} with a fisherman on Earth who speaks only Eskimo–Aleut, Stone resigns herself to being stranded and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As {{she begins to}} lose consciousness, Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing jets <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the capsule toward Tiangong. Stone then realizes that Kowalski's reappearance was a hallucination, but has nonetheless given her the strength of will to continue. She restores the flow of oxygen and uses the landing jets to navigate toward Tiangong on momentum.|$|E

5|$|After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals {{agreed on}} a new {{contract}} in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year. Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award. During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the Cardinals to a postseason berth.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000–01 season, Pathan was {{immediately}} back in the Under-19s, this time bowling more, often delivering more than 20 overs per innings. In four matches, he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out, and took 10 wickets at 32.50. He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra, prompting the Baroda selectors <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> him into the senior team.|$|E

5|$|Bajpayee won the Special Jury National Award for Pinjar (2003). This was {{followed}} by a series of brief, unnoticed roles in films that failed <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> his career forward. He then played a greedy politician in the political thriller Raajneeti (2010), which was well received. In 2012, Bajpayee essayed the role of Sardar Khan in Gangs of Wasseypur. His next roles were of a naxalite in Chakravyuh (2012), and a CBI officer in Special 26 (2013). In 2016, he portrayed professor Ramchandra Siras, in Hansal Mehta's biographical drama Aligarh, for which he won his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.|$|E
5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> the crew far enough in the event of an explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to add a driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{departure}} at 5/294 {{meant that}} {{the first of the}} bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Lindwall then made 77 <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> Australia to 458 on the fourth day, just 38 runs in arrears.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bears {{started out}} their post-season with a 27–24 {{win over the}} Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they {{defeated}} the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship Game. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> them to their first Super Bowl since 1985.

5|$|The BT19 {{was created}} by Australian {{designer}} Ron Tauranac for the Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) {{to use in the}} 1965 season of the Formula One motor racing World Championship. The BT19, and its contemporary the Lotus 39, were built to use the new FWMW flat-16 engine from Coventry Climax. Only one example of the BT19 design was built, and it never raced in its original form. Climax abandoned the FWMW's development before the end of 1965, their existing FWMV V8 engines proving powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>propel</b> Jim Clark's Lotus 33 to seven wins and the drivers' championship.|$|E
