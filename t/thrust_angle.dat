40|$|The {{increasing}} power levels {{now available}} on geo-synchronous satellites {{have made it}} feasible to use electric propulsion engines to perform orbit raising from transfer orbits to GEO. Electric thrusters have very low thrust but are highly efficient, so transfers require the thruster to fire almost continuously for weeks or even months, but also provide significant savings in propellant mass compared to all chemical missions. The complicated nature of the transfer and almost continual firing of the thruster require the <b>thrust</b> <b>angles</b> to be calculated and optimized for the entire transfer time. It is also important to optimize the transition point between the chemical and electric transfers, however the available low-thrust optimization tools are not rapid and flexible enough to allow a broad survey of possible strategies. For this reason, highly analytic derivations have been completed and new optimization software (called MITEOR – MIT Electric Orbit Raising) has been developed in Matlab to optimize <b>thrust</b> <b>angles</b> for constant-low-thrust transfers with no plane changes (2 D), as well as for transfers with plane changes (3 D) that are restricted to not rotating the argument of perigee or longitude of the ascending node.

40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail produces thrust by centrifugally spanned high voltage tethers {{interacting with the}} solar wind protons. The sail attitude can be controlled and attitude maneuvers are possible by tether voltage modulation synchronous with the sail rotation. Especially, the sail can be inclined {{with respect to the}} solar wind direction to obtain transverse thrust to change the osculating orbit angular momentum. Such an inclination has to be maintained by a continual control voltage modulation. Consequently, the tether voltage available for the thrust is less than the maximum voltage provided by the power system. Using a spherical pendulum as a model for a single rotating tether, we derive analytical estimations for the control efficiency for two separate sail control modes. One is a continuous control modulation that corresponds to strictly planar tether tip motion. The other is an on-off modulation with the tether tip moving along a closed loop on a saddle surface. The novel on-off mode is introduced here to both amplify the transverse thrust and reduce the power consumption. During the rotation cycle, the maximum voltage is applied to the tether only over two thrusting arcs when most of the transverse thrust is produced. In addition to the transverse thrust, we obtain the <b>thrusting</b> <b>angle</b> and electric power consumption for the two control modes. It is concluded that while the <b>thrusting</b> <b>angle</b> is about half of the sail inclination for the continuous modulation it approximately equals to the inclination angle for the on-off modulation. The efficiency of the on-off mode is emphasized when power consumption is considered, and the on-off mode can be used to improve the propulsive acceleration through the reduced power system mass.

A modified version of the SECKSPOT computer program calculates nearly time-optimal trajectories for the constrained case of zero pitch and roll. Unconstrained cases are generated with the SECKSPOT code. It is concluded that with a pitch constraint but without a roll constraint, power would not be a function of thrust direction, and so the time-optimal thruster direction would be along the projection of the primer vector in the plane normal to the radius vector. The roll constraint would cause power to become a function of <b>thrust</b> <b>angle</b> and sun angle.

To accomplish this control task, only bounded thrust level and <b>thrust</b> <b>angle</b> deviations are allowed, and these must be calculated based solely on the information gained from noisy, partial observations of the state. In order to establish the validity of various approximations, the problem is first investigated under the idealized conditions of perfect state information and negligible dynamic errors.

Until recently, numerical inves-tigations have been mainly limited to 2 -D studies because of the high computational cost required by 3 -D models. Here, we have efficiently coupled the landscape evolution model Cascade with the 3 -D thermome-chanically coupled tectonics code FANTOM. Details of the coupling algorithms between both codes are given. We present results of numerical experiments designed to study the response of viscous-plastic crustal materials subjected to convergence and to surface processes including both erosion and sedimentation. In particular, we focus on the equilibration of both the tectonic structures and on the surface morphology of the orogen. We show that increasing the efficiency of fluvial erosion increases the frontal <b>thrust</b> <b>angle,</b> which in turn decreases the width of the orogen. In addition, the maximum summit elevation of the orogen during transient evolution is significantly higher in those models showcasing surface processes than those that do not. This illustrates the strong coupling between tectonics and surface processes. We also demon-strate that an along-strike gradient of erosion efficiency can have a major impact upon the landscape mor-phology and the tectonic structure and deformation of the orogen, in both the across-strike and along-strike directions.
