25|$|Although Baltimore {{had a large}} free black {{population}} established before the American Civil War, it was a southern city that maintained de facto racial segregation.

During <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>era</b> of the late 1950s and 1960s, blacks argued to gain more positions in the police department {{in order to have a}} force that better reflected the demographics of the city, where they were a large minority.|$|E

5000|$|For {{those born}} after World War II, the {{emergence}} of television {{as a source of}} entertainment and information—as well as the associated massive expansion of consumerism afforded by post-war affluence and encouraged by TV advertising—were key components in creating disillusionment for some younger people and in the formulation of new social behaviours, even as ad agencies heavily courted the [...] "hip" [...] youth market. In the US, nearly real-time TV news coverage of <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era's</b> Birmingham Campaign, <b>the</b> [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] event of the Selma to Montgomery marches, and graphic news footage from Vietnam brought horrifying, moving images of the bloody reality of armed conflict into living rooms for the first time.|$|R

During the 1960s, Community Action programs connected with Native Americans were based on citizen participation. In the 1970s, the Choctaw repudiated the extremes of Indian activism. The Oklahoma Choctaw sought a local grassroots solution to reclaim their cultural identity and sovereignty as a nation. The Mississippi Choctaw would lay the foundations of business ventures.|$|E
25|$|Black-White {{segregation}} {{is consistently}} declining for most metropolitan areas and cities, {{though there are}} geographical differences. In 2000, for instance, the US Census Bureau found that residential segregation has on average declined since 1980 in the West and South, but less so in the Northeast and Midwest. Indeed, the top ten most segregated cities are in the Rust Belt, where total populations have declined {{in the last few}} decades. Despite these pervasive patterns, changes for individual areas are sometimes small. Thirty years after <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era,</b> the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which blacks and whites still often inhabit vastly different neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>era.</b> While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E

25|$|From 2000 to 2010, the United States Census Bureau {{reported}} that Mississippi {{had the highest}} rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population. In addition, Mississippi led the nation {{for most of the last}} decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population. The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation. In <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>era,</b> people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.|$|E

50|$|Miller {{develops}} a team named Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR), which fields African-American second-generation driver Benny Scott. The team endures corporate sponsorship rejection, due to prejudices and disbelief {{that a black}} team could be competitive in auto racing. After securing sponsorship from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, BAR enters Formula Super Vee and Formula 5000 races on America’s road racing circuits. The team {{makes it to the}} Long Beach Grand Prix in the mid-1970s. Nevertheless, after two years, Brown & Williamson ends its sponsorship programs around the world in auto racing, and BAR is unable to replace the sponsorship. This leads Miller to field a team independently with African-American driver Tommy Thompson, who lost his life in a race in 1978. Subsequently, Miller has continued to field teams in NASCAR. Challenges similar to those he faced during <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>eras</b> have continued to resurface, and Miller describes these in the book.|$|R
