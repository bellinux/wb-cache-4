5|$|In 1966, Canadian Lady {{made several}} {{important}} changes to <b>their</b> <b>advertising</b> strategy. They introduced television advertising {{and changed the}} emphasis from the product to the brand. Ads attempted to build consumer awareness of the single brand name: Wonderbra. Market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on televisionâ€”girdles were seen as armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.|$|E

Under "downward" commitment firms can commit only to paying at least <b>their</b> <b>advertised</b> wage. We show that wage posting is always an equilibrium, although in special cases other equilibria can exist. Surprisingly, the wage posting equilibrium in our economy {{is identical to the}} equilibrium when firms can commit to paying exactly their posted wage. When firms cannot even commit to paying at least <b>their</b> <b>advertised</b> wage, equilibrium exhibits job auctions with wage dispersion which generally are not constrained efficient. directed search, wage posting, job auctions, commitment...|$|R

5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the warm weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up <b>their</b> <b>advertising</b> in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E

5|$|In April 2005, the City of Marquette {{agreed to}} {{exchange}} jurisdiction {{over a number}} of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US41 and the unsigned M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and snowmobile access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related to the business loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US41 through downtown Marquette, even years after the decommissioning of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in <b>their</b> <b>advertising.</b>|$|E

The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds. These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in <b>their</b> <b>advertising.</b> Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E
