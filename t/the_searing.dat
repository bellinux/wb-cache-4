5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Bagan Serai, Perak, to a Malaysian Chinese family. In his early years, he favoured {{basketball}}, however his mother soon banned him from the game due to <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> heat of the outdoor basketball court. Lee began to learn badminton {{at the age of}} 11, when his father, who liked to play the game, brought him to the badminton hall. Attracting the attention of a local coach, the coach asked Lee's father if he could take him as a student. After receiving his father's consent, the coach began to train Lee after school. Discovered by Misbun Sidek, he was drafted into the national squad when he was seventeen years old.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease before, when he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Ngasaunggyan broke {{the back of}} Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several {{thousand}} men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it {{was not part of}} their invasion plan.|$|E

2500|$|On {{pulling the}} trigger of a wheellock firearm, <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> effects a slight {{rotation}} as described above. The end of <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> arm (that has hitherto locked the wheel and prevented it from turning) is disengaged, leaving the wheel free to turn under the tension of the mainspring. There is a subtlety here that is of vital importance: the [...] "hole" [...] {{in the side of}} the wheel into which <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> engages, is not a parallel-sided shaft. If it were, then under the tremendous tension of the mainspring, it would require a huge force on the trigger to disengage <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b> Nor is <b>the</b> tip of <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> arm cylindrical, which would have a similar effect. Rather, the [...] "hole" [...] is a depression in the wheel (like a small crater), and <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> has a rounded end: the wheel is locked by reason of lateral force on the shaft of the wheel rather than vertical force on <b>the</b> <b>sear.</b>|$|R

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Pagan, the Mongols left <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> Irrawaddy valley but the Pagan Kingdom was irreparably broken up into several small kingdoms. By the mid-14th century, the country had become {{organised}} along four major power centres: Upper Burma, Lower Burma, Shan States and Arakan. Many of the power centres were themselves made up of (often loosely held) minor kingdoms or princely states. This era was marked {{by a series of}} wars and switching alliances. Smaller kingdoms played a precarious game of paying allegiance to more powerful states, sometimes simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Alvinczi posted Oberst (Colonel) Wenzel Brigido's four battalions in the area; of these, two battalions and two cannons defended Arcole. These troops repulsed Augereau's leading demi-brigade under General of Brigade Louis Andr√© Bon. Before long, {{most of the}} French {{soldiers}} were lying {{in the lee of}} the causeway to shelter from <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> fire. Brigido pulled every available man into the combat. Augereau threw in demi-brigades led by Generals of Brigade Jean-Antoine Verdier and Pierre Verne. At mid-day, Austrian reinforcements led by General-Major Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky began arriving to help the defenders. Soon, Bon, Verdier, Verne and General of Brigade Jean Lannes were all wounded and the attack completely stalled.|$|E
25|$|Samawah {{has a large}} {{salt lake}} called Sawa Lake, which once had a tourist village that has since fallen into disrepair. The lake is located 25 km (15 mi) {{to the north of}} the city centre and is {{accessible}} by road. The lake has no obvious source, neither river nor ancient link to a sea. The water is extremely salty due to heavy evaporation in <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> heat of Mesopotamia and supports no marine life. A unique feature of the lake is that the water is above ground level surrounded by natural levees. Due to the high levels of salt in the lake, the levees heal themselves if a break is made in the levee, stopping the water from flowing down to ground level. The salt levels also improve buoyancy, and many migratory birds walk on the lake.|$|E

25|$|Five days later, on July 23, 1836, {{a band of}} Seminole {{attacked}} the lighthouse. Thompson and Carter reached the lighthouse tower; Thompson later recounted feeling rifle balls go through his clothes and hat. The Seminoles grabbed the door just after he turned the key to lock it. Thompson exchanged rifle fire with the Seminoles from upper windows in the tower {{for the rest of}} the day but after dark, the raiders approached the tower, setting fire to the door and a boarded-up window at ground level. Rifle balls had penetrated tanks in the bottom of the tower, which held 225 gallons of lamp oil for the light, and the oil caught fire. Thompson's clothing had been soaked with oil, and he and Carter retreated to the top of the tower, taking a keg of gunpowder, balls, and a rifle with them. The two men cut away a part of the wooden stairway below them in the tower before being driven out of the top by <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> flames.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval {{is usually}} a flat, lifeless wicket where the fastest bowlers could rarely get the ball to rise above knee level and looked fit for a {{thousand}} runs. Freddie Brown won the toss and sent Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook out the bat. The Yorkshireman was back at 31/1 {{and said that the}} wicket was turning so much that they would be lucky to make 250. He wasn't just saving his blushes as the fast-medium seamer Geoff Noblet took 5/54 in <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> heat and Slow Left Armer John Wilson 3/39 as the MCC were out for 211 with no batsman making 30 except Washbrook (32) and David Sheppard (32) {{at the start of the}} innings. The heat badly affected the South Australians with only Neil Dansie (44) made any headway as Eric Hollies took 3/16, Roy Tattersall (2/32) and Doug Wright (2/39) and Freddie Brown (1/1) spun them out for 126. Hutton (66) and Washbrook (45) added 112 for the first wicket in the MCC's reply of 220 with the leg-breaks of Allan McLean (5/68) cleaning up the tail after Noblet (3/39) helped remove the first three batsmen. Even so, 306 runs to win was too much for South Australia as they collapsed to 152 all out after being 90/1 with Dansie (42) top scoring again and Wright taking 5/57. This was the MCC's second win over South Australia and their fourth win in a row since the Third Test, so they had high hopes for Adelaide.|$|E

50|$|The trigger uses several {{components}} {{that make it}} safe, and yet simple to maintain. Within the trigger there is the long silver-colored AccuRelease lever mounted within the trigger body and sharing the trigger's pivot point in the housing. When at rest, the forward {{upper end of the}} AccuRelease is positioned directly behind <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> where it will block <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> should any external force cause it to jar out of the trigger notch. In normal operation, the trigger finger will first take up and depress the AccuRelease lever so that its forward tip drops out of the path of <b>the</b> <b>sear,</b> allowing <b>the</b> <b>sear</b> to move fully backward when released by the trigger at whatever weight you have adjusted the trigger pull to be.|$|R

When he boarded the ship, Judy climbed into a sack and Williams slung it {{over his shoulder to}} take on board. For three hours {{the men were}} forced to stand on deck in <b>the</b> <b>searing</b> heat, and for the entire time Judy remained still and silent in the bag on Wiliams's back. The conditions on board the ship were cramped with more than 700 prisoners. On 26 June 1944, the ship was torpedoed by HMS Truculent.
