Such use is however strongly discouraged because {{it can lead to}} accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes.|$|E

500|$|After Audette {{reveals that}} the call was a prank by CKOI in Montreal, Palin leaves the phone and {{can be heard in}} the {{background}} telling her aides that the call was [...] "just a radio station prank". Audette is still on the line and jokes that [...] "if one voice can change the world for Obama, one Viagra can change the world for McCain." [...] One of Palin's assistants {{picks up the phone and}} says [...] "I’m sorry, I have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> Thank you." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Million Reasons" [...] {{is written}} in the key of C major with its tempo {{swinging}} around 64 beats per minute, and is accompanied by piano and guitar. Gaga's vocals span from G3 to E5 in the song, which in common time, follows a progression of C–Am–F–G, with a chorus of F–C–Am–G. During the song's chorus, Gaga croons [...] "You're giving me a million reasons <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> / You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show". Its discussion of heartbreak and hope, as described by International Business Timess Nicholas Mojica, was guaranteed to [...] "resonate with [...] listeners" [...] of the record. Bustles Amy Roberts theorized that, {{like most of the}} songs from Joanne, [...] "Million Reasons" [...] had extra hidden depth in its lyrics and predicted it to be about Gaga's separated boyfriend Taylor Kinney. The phrase [...] "quit the show" [...] was described as a metaphor by Roberts about Gaga feeling dejected about her life, with the second verses confirming this. Both romantic heartbreak as catalyst and religious faith of the singer were represented as different sides of the lyrics. Roberts concluded by saying that [...] "hough the song may seem extremely fraught with sadness, confusion and heartache, its main message appears to be a pretty positive one".|$|E
2500|$|Others, {{particularly}} those writing about management for business audiences, {{see it as}} demonstrating the need for flexibility. Barry Maher calls the intractability of some listeners the Abraham Lincoln Syndrome after the ship named in {{his version of the}} anecdote, which he also represents as true. [...] "When the person you're dealing with refuses <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> where you want to go, divert your course", he advises salespeople, echoing the language in the story. [...] "Smashing into lighthouses is not a successful navigational strategy—no matter how pushy those lighthouses might be." [...] Within a marital context, Gary Smalley uses it to advise husbands trying to reconcile with their wives that [...] "like the navy captain's attempts to manipulate the lighthouse, your attempts to control the situation could cause your wife to become an immovable rock and resent you more deeply".|$|E
2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage and he says he never had any kids.|$|E

Running you down in the way we did in the channel wasn't like capturing you in a prize, and I think if the captain could see his way <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> without risk <b>to</b> himself he would do it.

Wilt thou remain a true prisoner upon thy parole, rescue or no rescue, as is the phrase amongst the warriors of this country? Wilt thou solemnly promise that thou wilt do so, and at my summons thou wilt present thyself before the Abbot and Chapter at Saint Mary's, and that thou wilt not stir from this house above {{a quarter of a}} mile in any direction? Wilt thou, I say, engage me thy word for this? and such is the sure trust which I repose in thy good faith, that thou shalt remain here unharmed and unsecured, a prisoner at large, subject only to appear before our court when called upon." ...|$|R
