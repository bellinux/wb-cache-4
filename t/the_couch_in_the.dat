25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them {{down the hall to}} Hardwick’s room.

40|$|According to John Manley, Night Supervisor at the Bronx 2 Garage, {{locker rooms}} are a highly social space. Sanitation workers {{create their own}} {{environment}} in which to relax during breaks. The locker room is arranged so that the lockers form walls and rooms. Some of these rooms have couches and televisions, some have pool tables, and some have lounge chairs. The sections are generally organized by ethnicity (for example, Italian, Puerto Rican, Irish, and so forth), though {{there seems to be}} generalized camaraderie amongst all workers. The arrangement is also quite practical: during heavy snowstorms, or other times when employees work mandatory overtime for several consecutive days, many employees spend their off hours sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> locker room rather than make the trek home and back. ...|$|R

500|$|... "Blown Away" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Carrie Underwood, taken from her fourth studio album {{of the same name}} (2012). The song served as the album's second single on July 9, 2012 through Arista Nashville. Written by Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote Underwood's single [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] (2007), [...] "Blown Away" [...] is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of a tornado. Producer Mark Bright drew inspiration from 1980s music.|$|E

Hilson leaves for the kitchen where she puts out champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries. She then gets ready in the bathroom while West waits in the bedroom. When Hilson is finished, she joins him in bed and they start cuddling and kissing. The video ends with Hilson looking into the camera over West's shoulder.|$|E
500|$|... "Blown Away" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A reviewer for Billboard thought that Mark Bright's [...] "brooding, atmospheric" [...] production and Underwood's vocal performance [...] "elevate this cinematic tune to an instant classic." [...] They further commented, [...] "When the girl shuts {{herself in the}} storm cellar, leaving her alcoholic father passed out on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of a twister, you can almost feel the wind." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood thought that the song confirmed {{the description of the}} album as [...] "a turn toward darkness from a singer who first topped the country chart with 'Jesus, Take the Wheel'." [...] USA Today columnist Brian Mansfield thought the song's [...] "synthesizers, strings sounds, vocal overdubs and echoing guitars" [...] combined dramatically, creating a [...] "neo-80s feel - think an Oklahoma version of the Eurythmics." [...] "Blown Away" [...] received a five-star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who called it [...] "dangerous, but irresistible." [...] He also praised Underwood for recording darker material than her previous singles. Also giving it five stars, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock called it [...] "more grandiose" [...] than Underwood's previous efforts, also saying that it [...] "makes itself known by sounding like absolutely nothing else on radio." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post gave the song a mixed review, deeming the lyrics as [...] "gripping", but negatively comparing the instrumentation to the work of Taylor Swift.|$|E

500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

50|$|Believing {{that such}} {{fundamental}} concepts as existence, truth and identity had been widely misunderstood by the philosophical tradition, and obfuscated especially by metaphysics, Williams attempted {{to show that}} they could be elucidated by a close analysis of the way those and related terms are actually used.

In this approach, founded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> logical work of Gottlob Frege, he was most immediately influenced by Arthur Prior and by his friend and fellow Roman Catholic philosopher Peter Geach.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} precise {{semantics}} for the two series of counting numerals of Latin: the cardinals and <b>the</b> collectives. <b>Couched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of mereological model-theoretic semantics, the proposal is that while a cardinal denotes a set of equinumerous combinations of elements of an individuation of the model, a collective denotes a set of equinumerous combinations of elements of a partition of the model. Crucial {{to the success of}} this simple proposal will be a number of nontrivial assumptions concerning the nature of groups and kinds <b>in</b> linguistic discourse, <b>the</b> semantics of pluralia tantum, and a distinction between specific and collective plurality. The paper also contains a preliminary discussion of the semantics of cardinals and collectives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, and Indie branches of Indoeuropean and, beyond Indoeuropean, in Finnish, Mongolian, and Greenlandic.
