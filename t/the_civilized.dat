5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the adventurers' ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a brief but {{informative}} tour of <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> area. They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces. The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|Eorzea's history {{revolves}} around {{a series of}} Umbral and Astral Eras. Umbral Eras are periods of great calamity—the First Umbral Era {{marked the end of}} the age of gods. The guardian deities of Eorzea, known as the Twelve, retreated from direct involvement with mortals during this time. Umbral Eras are followed by periods of enlightenment and cultural growth called Astral Eras. The Third Astral Era was particularly noted for presiding over the Allagan Empire, an ancient civilization whose technology far exceeds the level of the modern age. Each Umbral and Astral Era pair corresponds to one of the six basic elements—wind, lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water. The Sixth Umbral Era was believed to be the last and <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> races hoped the Sixth Astral Era would last forever. However, five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire catalyzed a series of events that would lead to the Seventh Umbral Era.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn {{takes place}} in the fictional world of Hydaelyn, a planet filled with {{multiple}} environments and climates covering three large continents. The region in which the game is set is called Eorzea. The four major city-states in Eorzea feature a wide variety of climates and biomes: the forest nation of Gridania is surrounded by a dense thicket called the Black Shroud; Ul'dah is a sultanate with a predilection for commerce situated in the Thanalan Desert; the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa finds its home in La Noscea on the island of Vylbrand; and Ishgard is a theocracy built in the snowy mountains of Coerthas. Eorzea is connected to a larger continent to the northeast which has largely been conquered by the militaristic Garlean Empire. Other political entities include the beastmen tribes who perennially assault <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> nations; Sharlayan, a scholarly city to the northwest; and Ala Mhigo, a city-state which was occupied during the first Garlean invasion twenty years prior to the events of the game. The four major city-states formed the Eorzean Alliance to repel this invasion but Ishgard abruptly withdrew, leaving the remaining three allies in name only. This conflict also resulted in the desolation of Mor Dhona, a once-vibrant region {{in the center of the}} continent that is now a barren wasteland.|$|E

25|$|Bloom's {{critique}} of contemporary social movements {{at play in}} universities or society at large is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation. For Bloom, the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> pursuits of honor and glory.|$|E

25|$|Turks, as an ethno-linguistic group, {{have been}} {{influenced}} by the Shahnameh since advent of Saljuqs. Toghrul III of Seljuqs is said to have recited the Shahnameh while swinging his mace in battle. According to Ibn Bibi, in 618/1221 the Saljuq of Rum Ala' al-Din Kay-kubad decorated the walls of Konya and Sivas with verses from the Shahnameh. The Turks themselves connected their origin not with Turkish tribal history but with the Turan of Shahnameh.

25|$|On September 29, 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan disputed Treaty of Lausanne.

25|$|At the 1884–85 Berlin Conference {{and related}} {{bilateral}} negotiations between Britain and Belgium, the land west {{and north of}} the Luapula River−Lake Mweru system (Katanga) was allocated to the Congo Free State while the land {{to the east and}} south was allocated to Britain and the BSAC. However the agreements included a Principle of Effectivity under which each colonial power had to set up an effective presence in the territory—by obtaining treaties from local tribal chiefs, flying their flag, and setting up an administration and police force to keep order—to confirm the claim. If they did not, a rival could come in and do so, thereby 'legally' taking over the territory in the eyes of <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> powers. In 1890 neither colonial power had treaties or an effective presence in Katanga, and as reports came of gold and copper being found in Katanga, the stage was set for a race between the BSAC and Free State.|$|E
25|$|I {{think that}} in no country in <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> world is less {{attention}} paid to philosophy than in the United States... Nevertheless {{it is easy to}} perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner, and govern it by the same rules; that is to say, that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method, they are in possession of one, common to the whole people. To evade the bondage of system and habit, of family maxims, class opinions, and, in some degree, of national prejudices; to accept tradition only as a means of information, and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise, and doing better; to seek the reason of things for one's self, and in one's self alone; to tend to results without being bound to means, and to aim at the substance through the form; – such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans... most of the operations of the mind, each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone.|$|E
25|$|During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch – {{using their}} {{expertise}} in doing business, cartography, shipbuilding, seafaring and navigation – {{traveled to the}} far corners of the world, leaving their language embedded {{in the names of}} many places. Dutch exploratory voyages revealed largely unknown landmasses to <b>the</b> <b>civilized</b> world and put their names on the world map. The Dutch came to dominate the map making and map printing industry by virtue of their own travels, trade ventures, and widespread commercial networks. As Dutch ships reached into the unknown corners of the globe, Dutch cartographers incorporated new geographical discoveries into their work. Instead of using the information themselves secretly, they published it, so the maps multiplied freely. For almost 200 years, the Dutch dominated world trade. Dutch ships carried goods, but they also opened up opportunities for the exchange of knowledge. The commercial networks of the Dutch transnational companies, i.e. the VOC and West India Company (WIC/GWIC), provided an infrastructure which was accessible to people with a scholarly interest in the exotic world. The VOC's bookkeeper Hendrick Hamel was the first known European/Westerner to experience first-hand and write about Joseon-era Korea. In his report (published in the Dutch Republic) in 1666 Hendrick Hamel described his adventures on the Korean Peninsula and gave the first accurate description of daily life of Koreans to the western world. The VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. Rangaku (literally 'Dutch Learning', and by extension 'Western Learning') is a body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine in the period when the country was closed to foreigners, 1641–1853, because of the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of national isolation (sakoku).|$|E
