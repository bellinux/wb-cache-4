40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of autonomous cars is accelerating on the integration of highly advanced artificial intelligence, which increases demand for a digital map with high accuracy. In particular, <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> are required to be precisely digitized since automatic driving utilizes them for position detection. To draw <b>traffic</b> <b>markings,</b> we benefit from Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) equipped with high-density Laser imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanners, which produces large amount of data efficiently with XYZ coordination along with reflectance intensity. Digitizing this data, on the other hand, conventionally has been dependent on human operation, which thus suffers from human errors, subjectivity errors, and low reproductivity. We have tackled this problem by means of automatic extraction of traffic marking, which partially accomplished to draw several <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> (G. Takahashi et al., 2014). The key idea of the method was extracting lines using the Hough transform strategically focused on changes in local reflection intensity along scan lines. However, it failed to extract <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> properly in a densely marked area, especially when local changing points are close each other. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional gradient-based detection method where local changing points are labelled with plus or minus group. Given that each label corresponds to the boundary between <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> and background, we can identify <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> explicitly, meaning traffic lines are differentiated correctly by the proposed method. As such, our automated method, a highly accurate and non-human-operator-dependent method using bidirectional gradient-based algorithm, can successfully extract traffic lines composed of complex shapes such as a cross walk, resulting in minimizing cost and obtaining highly accurate results...|$|E

40|$|Upgrading the {{database}} of CYBER JAPAN has been strategically promoted because the "Basic Act on Promotion of Utilization of Geographical Information", was enacted in May 2007. In particular, {{there is a}} high demand for road information that comprises a framework in this database. Therefore, road inventory mapping work has to be accurate and eliminate variation caused by individual human operators. Further, the large number of <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> that are periodically maintained and possibly changed require an efficient method for updating spatial data. Currently, we apply manual photogrammetry drawing for mapping <b>traffic</b> <b>markings.</b> However, this method is not sufficiently efficient in terms of the required productivity, and data variation can arise from individual operators. In contrast, Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) and high-density Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) scanners are rapidly gaining popularity. The aim in this study is to build an efficient method for automatically drawing <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> using MMS LIDAR data. The key idea in this method is extracting lines using a Hough transform strategically focused on changes in local reflection intensity along scan lines. However, also note that this method processes every traffic marking. In this paper, we discuss a highly accurate and non-human-operator-dependent method that applies the following steps: (1) Binarizing LIDAR points by intensity and extracting higher intensity points; (2) Generating a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) from higher intensity points; (3) Deleting arcs by length and generating outline polygons on the TIN; (4) Generating buffers from the outline polygons; (5) Extracting points from the buffers using the original LIDAR points; (6) Extracting local-intensity-changing points along scan lines using the extracted points; (7) Extracting lines from intensity-changing points through a Hough transform; and (8) Connecting lines to generate automated traffic marking mapping data...|$|E

The problem of clogging in Jakarta is not only due to the ever increasing number of motor vehicles and minimum development of streets, but also to the behavior of road users. The behavior of road users is vital in solving the problems in transportation such as clogging or traffic safety like the circumstances in Jakarta today. This study aims at analyzing and understanding the occurrence of disorderliness/indiscipline phenomenon in road traffic, in particular the one related to ignorance to meaning of <b>traffic</b> signs, road <b>markings,</b> and <b>traffic</b> signal emitting devices perceived from social scope. This study employs qualitative method and is limited to specific road segments in Jakarta Megalopolis Area in particular the ones passed by the author, including Jakarta, Southern Tangerang, and Depok City areas.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of delineation {{is to provide}} the visual information needed by a driver to operate a vehicle {{in a variety of}} situations. Delineation includes the marking of highways with painted or more durable pavement marking lines and symbols, guideposts, and other devices such as curbs (see Chapter 1140). These devices use retroreflectance, which is the reflecting of light from a vehicle’s headlights back to the driver, to enhance an object’s visibility at nighttime. It is important to maintain an adequate level of retroreflectivity for both traffic signs and <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> for motorists during hours of darkness and during adverse weather conditions. Delineation is a required safety item of work and is addressed on all projects. A decision to omit delineation work can only be justified if the existing delineation is unaffected by construction and an evaluation of accident rates clearly shows that delineation is not a contributing factor. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses the latest edition of the MUTCD as a guide for the design, location, and application of delineation. Consult with the region Traffic Office early in the design process to ensure the proposed delineation is compatible with WSDOT policy and region preference.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{an estimate of}} the cost of highway resurfacing necessitated by damage from studded tires. The total is $ 95, 620, 000 for the twenty-five years from 1971 to 1996. This total includes $ 51, 937, 000 to resurface pavements and bridges on Interstate routes and $ 43, 683, 000 for other Primary highways. The estimate for Interstate routes includes those sections now open to traffic and those planned for completion by November 1974. The estimate for other Primary routes includes rural and municipal sections open to traffic as of November 1970. The estimate was prepared by computing the cost of expected pavement and bridge resurfacing costs for the twenty-five year period assuming continued use of studded tires, then subtracting from this the expected resurfacing) cost for the same period assuming that the use of' studded tires is prohibited. The total figure, $ 95, 620, 000, should be regarded as a conservative estimate of the cost which may be avoided by prohibiting the use of studded tires in Iowa. The conservative nature of the estimate may be demonstrated by the following examples of the guidelines used iri its preparation. 1. Only mainline pavements were included in the cost estimate for the Interstate routes. The connecting loops, exit ramps and entrance ramps at Interstate interchanges contain many additional miles of pavement subject to wear by studded tires. This pavement was omitted from the estimate because reliable ' information about the rate of pavement wear at such locations is not available. As a result, the Interstate resurfacing costs are underestimated. 2. Several other costs were also omitted from the estimate {{because of a lack of}} sufficient information. These include the cost of repairing damage caused by studded tires to city streets other than those designated as Primary routes, the damage to pavements and bridges on the more-heavily travelled Secondary roads, and the damage to pavement <b>traffic</b> <b>markings</b> on all highway systems. Experience indicates that portland cement concrete pavements in Iowa have a normal service life of twenty-five years before resurfacing becomes necessary. The service life for asphalt pavements is thirteen years. In making this cost estimate, the need for resurfacing was attributed to wear from studded tires only when the normal service life of the pavement was shortened by that wear. Consequently, this cost estimate does not account for the reduced safety and convenience to Iowa motorists during the time when pavement wear caused by studded tires is significant but less than the critical amount...|$|E

The current study validates a Chinese {{version of the}} Driver Stress Inventory (DSI) and explores its correlation with dangerous driving behaviors and gender. A sample of 246 drivers completed the Chinese version of the DSI and the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ). We also evaluated specific sociodemographic variables and traffic violations (including speeding, violating <b>traffic</b> signs or <b>markings,</b> driving while intoxicated, running a red light, and incurring penalty points). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) verified the DSI&# 39;s internal structure. The DSI was also validated using questionnaires related to the DBQ self-reported traffic accidents and violations, and sociodemographic characteristics. First, all of the DSI dimensions were moderately or weakly correlated with the DBQ subscales. Second, aggression, hazard monitoring and fatigue were weakly correlated with minor accidents. Third, drivers who had sped and violated traffic signs during the previous three years reported higher aggression and thrill seeking, while drivers who had violated <b>traffic</b> signs or <b>markings</b> during the previous three years reported decreased hazard monitoring compared with non-offenders. Finally, there were significant gender differences in driver stress. The Chinese version of the DSI will be useful for classifying and diagnosing drivers who may be at an increased risk for stress reactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
