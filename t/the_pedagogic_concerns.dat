The research is based on the following ideas: correlation between the scientific terminology formation and scientific knowledge genesis; philosophic concept as a form and result of reality reflection; linguistic concept of the term as a functional unit of a scientific language; specifics of pedagogic knowledge reflection in conceptual form. The main research findings include identifying methodological requirements for analyzing the conceptual scientific formation in historical context; substantiating the resource basis; revealing the investigation principles; describing the tools and their implementation peculiarities with regard to the specifics of pedagogical concepts and terms. The acquired results can be used while exploring <b>the</b> <b>pedagogic</b> history prob lems, pedagogic methodology and terminology. In conclusion, the actual research trends of pedagogic terminology formation are reviewed from <b>the</b> historical <b>pedagogic</b> perspective.   </div...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to present a}} review of Facebook group pages as an educational tool for language learning. One of the primary needs of foreign language learners is to gain the opportunity to use the target language outside the classroom practice. Social media communication provides occasions for learners to receive input and produce output while engaging in negotiation of meaning. In line with this point, teachers can instigate class group pages in the social media {{in an attempt to}} provide a space for practice and communication free of <b>the</b> traditional <b>pedagogic</b> <b>concerns</b> of a typical classroom. The distinctive discursive behaviour of Facebook group pages helps one to achieve that attempt. In light of these views, the researcher, in this study, formed a group page to understand the dynamics of social media environment as a supporting tool for language classrooms. This paper addresses various features which make social media a unique place to contribute to the sense of class community and collaboration outside the classroom. The face-to face classroom is a controlled communication event, that is, teachers and students are required to be in the classroom at the same time but a teacher’s use of Facebook is an attempt to communicate with students outside of that controlled environment where teachers can meet students in their territory. When compared to its disadvantages, the advantages of setting a class group page on the social media outweigh. Students can feel motivated to contribute to an online community if they subsequently receive support or help. It also leads students to feel that they are being supported by a whole portion of their class community and promotes students’ desire to maintain a valued relationship with others. Students continue developing and strengthening relationships with others...|$|R

40|$|This ESRC funded study investigates {{how young}} {{children}} integrate {{a range of}} multimodal strategies, including talk, body movement, gesture and gaze, to make and express meaning at home and playgroup during their first year in preschool. Using longitudinal ethnogrpahic video case studies of four 3 -year-old children, two boys and two girls, this study identifies patterns in the children's uses of different communicative strategies {{that relate to the}} dynamics of the social, institutional and immediate contexts in which they are situated, particularly with regard to whether at home or in playgroup; with familiar or less familiar other; with adults or peers; with peers of the same sex or age group and with different playgroup activities. The thesis draws on post-modern interpretations of knowledge and truths to reflect critically on <b>the</b> different <b>pedagogic</b> discourses <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> role of talk in learning implied in the Foundation Stage Cuurriculum and to revisit Vygtskian and neo-Vygotskian theories of talk and learning in the light of children's multimodal sign making in different settings. Byinterpreting the children's gaze, facial gestures and body movements as part of both communicative and meaning-making processes, the study peices together unique and composite understandings of how children conform to and resist the communicative practices of the 'speech community' (Hymes 1996) within the playgroup studied. These findings in turn give new insights into the genesis of pupil identity and issues of power, control and agency. Futhermore, the study discusses the development of systems for handling and representing complex video data alongside more traditional data collection methods, including audio recordings, field and diary notes and interviews. The thesis concludes by discussing how the study findings contribute to growing understandings of the multimodal processes of young children's making and expresing of meaning and consequent implications for early years policy and practice.
