50|$|Metalworking <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> {{were often}} made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Both tools {{can be used}} {{to clean}} up a thread, which is called chasing. However, using an {{ordinary}} tap or die to clean threads will generally result in the removal of some material, which will result in looser and weaker threads. Because of this, threads are typically cleaned using special <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> made for this purpose, which are known as [...] "chasers". Chasers are made of softer materials and are not capable of cutting new threads, however they are still tighter fitting than actual fasteners and are fluted like regular <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> (to provide a means for debris like dirt and rust to escape). One particularly common use is for automotive spark plug threads, which often suffer from corrosion and a buildup of carbon.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{generate}} a screw thread, including the traditional subtractive types (e.g., various kinds of cutting <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> die heads, milling; molding; casting casting, sand casting; forming and rolling; grinding; and occasionally lapping to follow the other processes); newer additive techniques; and combinations thereof.|$|R

5000|$|Threads can be (and often are) {{truncated}} a bit more, yielding thread {{depths of}} 60 percent to 75 {{percent of the}} [...]65p value. For example, a 75 percent thread sacrifices {{only a small amount}} of strength in exchange for a significant reduction in the force required to cut the thread. The result is that <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> wear is reduced, the likelihood of breakage is lessened and higher cutting speeds can often be employed.|$|R
50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> <b>and</b> urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws.|$|R
50|$|<b>Taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are tools used {{to create}} screw threads, which is called threading. Many are cutting tools; others are forming tools. A tap is used to cut or form the female portion of the mating pair (e.g., a nut). A die is used to cut or form the male portion of the mating pair (e.g., a bolt). The process of cutting or forming threads using a tap is called tapping, whereas the process using a die is called threading.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The single-point cutting tools or <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R
50|$|Die {{making is}} a subgenre of tool making {{that focuses on}} making <b>and</b> {{maintaining}} <b>dies.</b> This often includes making punches, dies, steel rule <b>dies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>sets.</b> Precision is key in <b>die</b> making; punches <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have <b>die</b> <b>sets</b> machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.|$|R

50|$|Before this, {{screw threads}} were usually made by {{chipping}} and filing (that is, with skilled freehand use of chisels and files). Nuts were rare; metal screws, when made at all, were usually {{for use in}} wood. Metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening {{on the other side}} were usually fastened in non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer). Maudslay standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced <b>sets</b> of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.|$|R

5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole is threaded.|$|R

50|$|In 1795 the South Hadley Canal opened, {{enabling}} {{boats to}} bypass the South Hadley falls and reach Greenfield via the Connecticut River. Located at {{the confluence of the}} Deerfield and Green rivers, and not far from where they merge into the Connecticut River, Greenfield developed into a trade center. Falls provided water power for industry, and Greenfield grew into a prosperous mill town. John Russell established the Green River Works in 1834, hiring skilled German workers at what was the country's first cutlery factory. The Connecticut River Railroad was the first of several railways to enter the town, replacing the former canal trade. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Greenfield {{was one of the most}} important American centers of the <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> business <b>and</b> was the home of Greenfield Tap & Die Company (GTD).|$|R

50|$|Maudslay {{designed}} a tool holder {{into which the}} cutting tool would be clamped, and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction. The slide rest was positioned by a leadscrew to which power was transmitted through a pair of changeable gears so that it traveled {{in proportion to the}} turning of the work. This allowed screw threads to be precisely cut. Changing the gears gave various pitches. The ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components. He standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced <b>sets</b> of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size.

50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as planes, table knives, anvils, files, <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, handsaws, and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} growing demand for rapid, {{low-cost}} die fabrication technology in the sheet metal forming industry, easy-to-machine, polyurethane-based, composite board stock is widely used as a rapid tooling material. However the failure mechanisms of the rapid prototyped tools are not clearly understood, thus making the prediction of tool life difficult. As a fundamental step for effective tool life estimation, the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the polymer composite tooling material were characterized. A finite element model of 90 degrees V-die bending process was developed, {{and the effects of}} process parameters on stress distribution in punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> were investigated through simulation.

2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} milling cutter if the correct helical toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|R

50|$|A snap {{fastener}} (also called press stud, popper, snap or tich) {{is a pair}} of interlocking discs, made out of a metal or plastic, commonly used in place of buttons to fasten clothing and for similar purposes. A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove {{on the top of the}} other, holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. Different types of snaps can be attached to fabric or leather by riveting with a punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>set</b> specific to the type of rivet snaps used (striking the punch with a hammer to splay the tail), sewing, or plying with special snap pliers.|$|R
5000|$|A typical CNC {{turret punch}} has {{a choice of}} up to 60 tools in a [...] "turret" [...] that can be rotated to bring any tool to the {{punching}} position. A simple shape (e.g., a square, circle, or hexagon) is cut directly from the sheet. A complex shape can be cut out by making many square or rounded cuts around the perimeter. As a press tool requires a matching punch <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>set,</b> there are two corresponding turrets, {{above and below the}} bed, for punch <b>and</b> <b>die.</b> These two turrets must rotate in precise synchronisation and with their alignment carefully maintained. Several punches of identical shape may be used in the turret, each one turned to a different angle, as there is usually no feature to rotate the sheet workpiece relative to the tool.|$|R
