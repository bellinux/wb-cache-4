5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

Three participants were interviewed and the relevant themes that emerged from those interviews were coded and reported. The study was conducted from a qualitative perspective that was grounded in <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> methodology. <b>The</b> survivors' individual <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> meaning {{at the time of their}} sexual abuse, their introduction to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> meaning about child sexual abuse and the double bind between these constructions are reported. The survivors' narratives are representations of the positive way they constructed meaning about their experiences as a way of coping. Their stories are also reflections of the confusion they experienced when introduced to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> child sexual abuse that differed from the meaning they attributed to their experiences. The study is a representation of the double bind that the difference between <b>the</b> individual and <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> their child sexual abuse created for them...|$|R

The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations. Patriarchal cultures are criticized for [...] "limiting forms of masculinity" [...] available to men and thus narrowing their life choices. Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.|$|E

50|$|Males have a {{much higher}} rate of {{completed}} suicide than females. One common explanation relies on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> hegemonic masculinity and femininity. In {{a review of the}} literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates were explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, and risk-taking behavior. Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and depression.|$|R
50|$|The {{major themes}} in The Eye of the Heron are themes common {{to much of}} Le Guin's fiction and include <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> gender, {{interactions}} between individuals from different societies, intra-actions within societies, and contact with that which is perceived as alien or other. The novel also explores different forms {{of social and political}} organization by juxtaposing pacifist anarchism with violent oligarchy.

500|$|But I'm a Cheerleader is {{not only}} about sexuality, but also gender and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> gender roles. One {{of the ways in}} which Babbit {{highlighted}} what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design. Chris Holmlund in Contemporary American Independent Film notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes [...] "gender-tuned." [...] Ted Gideonse in Out magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of knowledge is}} the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the {{sociology of}} knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare socially constructed reality). The [...] "archaeological" [...] and [...] "genealogical" [...] studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.|$|E
