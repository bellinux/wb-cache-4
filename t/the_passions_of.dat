5|$|Most of {{the address}} is an {{extended}} policy statement about his eight years in office, with some pointed comments mixed in highlight certain points, in which he builds a case for the steps needed to perpetuate the union, a concept that began to germinate among and between the states during the Revolutionary War. In doing so he lifts up a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|In 444 BC, the {{conservative}} {{and the democratic}} factions confronted {{each other in a}} fierce struggle. The ambitious new leader of {{the conservative}}s, Thucydides (not {{to be confused with the}} historian of the same name), accused Pericles of profligacy, criticizing the way he spent the money for the ongoing building plan. Thucydides initially managed to incite <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> the ecclesia regarding these charges in his favor. However, when Pericles took the floor, his resolute arguments put Thucydides and the conservatives firmly on the defensive. Finally, Pericles proposed to reimburse the city for all questionable expenses from his private property, with the proviso that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance was greeted with applause, and Thucydides was soundly, if unexpectedly, defeated. In 442BC, the Athenian public voted to ostracize Thucydides from the city for 10 years and Pericles was once again the unchallenged ruler of the Athenian political arena.|$|E
5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, {{the head of}} Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. Sawyer, {{in the aftermath of}} Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college presidents in local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking him to sign a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges drew his revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E

Most of these critics who demand [...] "passion" [...] {{would seem to have}} no conception <b>of</b> any <b>passion</b> but one. Yet there are several other passions: <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> grief, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> avarice, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> pity, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> ambition, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> hate, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> envy, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> devotion, <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> friendship; and all these have a greater part in the drama <b>of</b> life than <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> love, and infinitely greater than <b>the</b> <b>passion</b> <b>of</b> guilty love.

25|$|On 1 January 1559 the {{anonymous}} Beggars' Summons was {{posted on the}} doors of friaries, threatening friars with eviction {{on the grounds that}} their property belonged to the genuine poor. This was calculated to appeal to <b>the</b> <b>passions</b> <b>of</b> the populace of towns who appeared to have particular complaints against friars. Knox returned to Scotland and preached at the church of St. John the Baptist's at Perth on 11 May on Christ cleansing the temple. The congregation responded by stripping the shrines, images and altars of the church and then sacked the local friaries and Carthusian house. The regent responded by sending troops to restore order and Glencairn led a force to defend the town's new Protestant status. A royal delegation, including Argyll and James Stuart persuaded the burgh to open its gates, but the heavy handed treatment by the regent's forces led to a breakdown in negotiations. Argyll and Stuart changed sides and the Lords of the Congregation now began raising their followers for an armed conflict.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} of the legislature into an upper and lower house wasn't questioned either, despite the obscure origins of the English House of Lords and its role as {{the representative of the}} hereditary nobility.

500|$|Composers of the {{generation}} after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; diatonic and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of atonal and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: Tony Palmer's O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams and John Bridcut's <b>The</b> <b>Passions</b> <b>of</b> Vaughan Williams. British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the Tallis Fantasia and The Lark Ascending increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called [...] "a genius driven by emotion". Among the 21st-century musicians who have acknowledged Vaughan Williams's influence on their development are John Adams, PJ Harvey, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Anthony Payne, Wayne Shorter, Neil Tennant and Mark-Anthony Turnage.|$|E
500|$|In one sample year, 1947, RKO {{produced}} {{along with}} several noir programmers and A pictures, two straight B noirs: Desperate and The Devil Thumbs a Ride.

Along with these eighteen unambiguous B noirs, an additional dozen or so noir programmers came out of Hollywood. Still, most of the majors' low-budget production remained the sort now largely ignored.
