Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were both inhibited by E. baileyana leaf extract although Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible. 4 of 11 Gram-negative (36 %) and 2 of 3 Gram-positive bacteria (67 %) had their growth inhibited by E. baileyana extract. E. major leaf extract displayed broad antibacterial activity, inhibiting the growth of 10 of the 14 bacteria (71 %). E. major flower extract inhibited the growth of 7 of the 14 bacteria (50 %). E. major leaf and flower extracts both preferentially inhibited Gram-positive bacteria (100 %) compared to Gram-negative bacteria (64 % inhibition by leaf extract; 36 % inhibition by flower <b>extracts).</b> None <b>of</b> the <b>Eucalyptus</b> <b>extracts</b> showed any antifungal activity. The antibacterial activity of E. major leaf extract was further investigated by growth time course assays which showed significant growth inhibition in cultures of Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens within 1 h and in Bacillus subtilis and Aeromonas hydrophilia within 2 h.

The employed method was optimized for separation, identification and quantification of fifty six compounds including ellagitannins, flavonoids, phloroglucinol derivatives and galloyl esters. The antioxidant effect was determined in vitro using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH ·), hydroxyl radical and super oxide anion radical scavenging assays. The cytotoxicity of the aqueous acetone extract was evaluated on MCF- 7, Hep- 2, HepG- 2, HeLa, HCT- 116 and Caco- 2 cell lines. The results indicated {{that most of the}} fractions exhibited strong antioxidant activity. The aqueous acetone extract reduced the viability of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and was more active on MCF- 7 and HCT- 116 cell lines...|$|R

Twenty-nine phenolic compounds were identified, 16 of them referenced {{for the first time}} as constituents of E. globulus bark, namely, quinic, dihydroxyphenylacetic, and caffeic acids, bis(hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)) -glucose, galloyl-bis(HHDP) -glucose, galloyl-HHDP-glucose, isorhamentin-hexoside, quercetin-hexoside, methylellagic acid (EA) pentose conjugate, myricetin-rhamnoside, isorhamnetin-rhamnoside, mearnsetin, phloridzin, mearnsetin-hexoside, luteolin, and a proanthocyanidin B-type dimer. Digalloylglucose was identified as the major compound in the methanol and methanol/water extracts, followed by isorhamnetin-rhamnoside in the methanol extract and by catechin in the methanol/water extract, whereas in the water extract catechin and galloyl- HHDP-glucose were identified as the predominant components. The methanol/water extract was shown be the most efficient to isolate phenolic compounds identified in E. globulus bark.

40|$|In {{the seed}} industry, seed {{pelleting}} {{is a method}} used for better crop establishment. Due to problems with the cultivation of Trifolium repens seeds in cold regions, seed pelleting was used. In {{the first stage of}} experiment, the effect of some allelopathic compounds including Ephedrine, Vanillin, Caffeine, ABA, <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eucalyptus</b> camadulensis leaf, Onobryichis sativa seed and Juglans regia leaf on germination indicators (percentage germination, germination start, coefficient of velocity and coefficient of allometry) of Trifolium repens seeds were tested. Results showed that among tested allelochemicals Vanillin, ABA and Eucalyptus camadulensis leaf extract were suitable allelochemicals for seed pelleting. In the second stage, seeds were coated with those allelochemicals using seed pelleting method, with no negative effect on seedling growth or on percentage germination. Germination of seeds coated with these allelochemicals was delayed with respect to control but seeds pelleted with Eucalyptus camadulensis leaf extract exhibited delayed germination for longer time than the other treatments...|$|R

The methanolic <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>Eucalyptus</b> tereticornis for antibacterial activity against the bacterial strain Escherichia coli was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) was adopted to optimize the effect of process variables.

40|$|ABSTRACT The present work {{investigated}} the effects <b>of</b> aqueous <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>eucalyptus</b> (Eucalyptus globulus) and elderberry (Sambucus ebulus) leaves on β-carotene productivity in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga. Leaf extracts from eucalyptus have greater amounts of phenolics and flavonoids, {{as well as}} greater ferric reducing antioxidant potential than elderberry. The <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> both species greatly inhibited growth of algal suspensions. However, chlorophyll and β-carotene concentration increased in cells treated with leaf extracts, and the highest values were detected in 1 % eucalyptus and 2 % elderberry extracts. Fresh weight, total sugar, and protein content significantly increased following exposure of cells to different doses <b>of</b> leaf <b>extracts.</b> However, in doses containing more than 2 % eucalyptus, the upward trend for total sugar and protein ceased and remained statistically unchanged. These results suggest that metabolic modifications enable D. salina cells to tolerate the stress induced by the leaf extracts through allocating carbon flux to the synthesis of osmolytes and putative antioxidant molecules (e. g. sugars and β-carotene). Therefore, the use <b>of</b> leaf <b>extracts</b> holds {{potential to be a}} promising and effective way to improve D. salina cultivation for β-carotene production and other biotechnological and industrial applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The global {{call on the}} use of {{botanicals}} {{sequel to}} control of phytopathogenic microorganisms causing diseases of food crops most especially on rice has not been given attention in the tropics. A study was conducted to evaluate the antagonistic effect (in-vitro) of aqueous and ethanol <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eucalyptus</b> lameldulensis and Moringa oleifera leaves at different concentration (5, 10, 20, 40 and 160 mg/ml) on fungal and bacterial pathogens affecting the aerial part of rice. The isolated fungal pathogens were Curvularia sp., Helminthosporium sp., Monascus rubber and Pyricularia grisea while that of bacterial pathogens were Xanthomonas oryzae and Corynobacterium xerosis. The aqueous extract from the botanicals showed less inhibition compared to the ethanol extract. All the tested concentration levels with respect to aqueous and ethanol extracts were significantly (p< 0. 05) effective on the fungal and bacterial pathogens. The highest inhibitory activity was observed on Curvularia sp. for fungi and Xanthomonas oryzae for bacteria. Eucalyptus lameldulensis and Moringa oleifera leaves extracts are therefore recommended for management of microbial pathogens of rice.
