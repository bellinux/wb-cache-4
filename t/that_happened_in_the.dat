When Karl tells her that he loves her, Susan rejects him. She later hands him divorce papers and confronts Sarah.|$|E
5|$|The migrations and {{invasions of}} the 4th and 5th centuries {{disrupted}} trade networks around the Mediterranean. African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing {{from the interior}} and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By {{the end of the}} 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now admit that they are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, they come to the Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the Union Cross to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia carries her Chrithy towards the door before they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), the story itself goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of its own resources, Spain has to import all of its fossil fuels, which in a {{scenario}} of record prices added much pressure to the inflation rate. Thus, in June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high of 5.00%. Then, with the dramatic decrease of oil prices <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of 2008 plus the confirmed burst of the property bubble, concerns quickly shifted to the risk of deflation instead, as Spain registered in January 2009 its lowest inflation rate in 40 years which was then followed in March 2009 by a negative inflation rate {{for the first time ever}} since this statistic was recorded.|$|E

The fifth charge included eight counts of illegally treating captured Soviet soldiers as though they were partisans or terrorists, and alleged that many were killed as a result of orders issued by the High Command and Manstein's own order of 20 September 1941.|$|E

This was the only time in cricketing history that 5 wickets had fallen in an over of any international format and <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final over of a T20 World Cup clash.

25|$|Historian J.M.

The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium.

Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E

First, JÃ¼rgen RÃ¶ber was brought in, then later Miodrag JeÅ¡iÄ‡, though neither succeeded in winning the domestic title.

When <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 28th over, and the score was at 121 for 2, the Bangladeshis tried to hit out, and duly lost three wickets to Dilshan's off spin. Shahriar Nafees was first to fall to Dilshan's spin, having made his second ODI fifty in six games, while Rafique and Ashraful followed shortly afterwards. Forced onto the back foot with the score 140 for 5, Bangladesh put on substitute Tushar Imran, who joined in a partnership of 71 with Bashar in 13 overs. However, the pair scored too slowly to have any chance of winning, instead just trying to save face. Sri Lanka saved their pace bowlers again, opting for Dilshan, Upul Chandana and even the medium pace of Mahela Jayawardene, as they used eight of their eleven possible bowlers in the innings.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{civil war}} and the {{resulting}} chaos <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole Safavid Empire after its disintegration and overthrow, the Ottomans and Russians decided to divide large parts of Persia in the Treaty of Constantinople (1724). Georgia got divided by the two. Following Persia's quick resurgence under Nader Shah of Iran, the Ottomans were ousted from Kakheti {{and the rest of}} Georgia in 1735 by Nader after two years of rule, which resulted in the quick reestablishment of Persian rule over this time almost all of Georgia. Teimuraz sided with the Persians and was installed as a Persian wali (governor) in neighboring Kartli. However, many Georgian nobles refused to accept the new regime and rose in rebellion in response to heavy tribute levied by Nadir upon the Georgian provinces. Nonetheless, Teimuraz and Heraclius remained loyal to the shah, partly in order to prevent the comeback of the rival Mukhrani branch, whose fall early in the 1720s had opened the way to Teimurazâ€™s accession in Kartli. He then served as a lieutenant to his father and assumed the regency when Teimuraz was briefly summoned for consultations in the Persian capital of Isfahan in 1744. In the meantime, Heraclius defeated a coup attempt by the rival Georgian prince Abdullah Beg of the Mukhrani dynasty, and helped Teimuraz suppress the aristocratic opposition to the Persian hegemony led by Givi Amilakhvari. As a reward, Nadir granted the kingship of Kartli to Teimuraz and of Kakheti to Heraclius, and also arranged the marriage of his nephew Ali-Qoli Khan, who eventually would succeed him as Adil Shah, to Teimurazâ€™s daughter Kethevan.|$|E
