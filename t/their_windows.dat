5|$|Hundreds {{of homes}} in the Hemel Hempstead area were evacuated, and about 2,000people had to find {{alternative}} accommodation; emergency services asked residents of the smoke-affected areas to close <b>their</b> <b>windows</b> and doors and to stay inside.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate <b>their</b> <b>windows</b> with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E
5|$|Backhoes {{and dump}} trucks {{gradually}} removed the debris and sand from San Blas. Dozens of storeowners, municipal employees, and volunteers in Puerto Vallarta worked {{to clear the}} debris caused by the storm. The remaining stores, bars, and shops placed signs on <b>their</b> <b>windows</b> describing they were open in effort to attract the tourists still in the town. By about {{two months after the}} hurricane, most hotels, restaurants, and shops were reopened.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, Glowee, a French company {{started selling}} bioluminescent lights, {{targeting}} shop fronts and municipal street signs as their main markets. France has {{a law that}} forbids retailers and offices from illuminating <b>their</b> <b>windows</b> between 1 and 7 {{in the morning in}} order to minimise energy consumption and pollution. Glowee hoped their product would get around this ban. They used bacteria called Aliivibrio fischeri which glow in the dark, but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out <b>their</b> <b>Windows</b> RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of <b>their</b> <b>windows</b> and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E

5|$|He {{provided}} new fronts {{to the two}} official {{buildings of}} Rome's civic government, the Palazzo dei Conservatori, the Senatorio, and finally the Nuovo. Michelangelo designed a new façade for the dilapidated Palazzo dei Conservatori and he designed the Palazzo Nuovo to be a mirror complement, thereby providing balance and coherence to the ragged ensemble of existing structures. The construction of these two buildings were carried out after his death {{under the supervision of}} Tommaso Cavalieri. The sole arched motif in the entire Campidoglio design is the segmental pediments over <b>their</b> <b>windows,</b> which give a slight spring to the completely angular vertical-horizontal balance of the design. The three palazzi are now home to the Capitoline Museums.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for vertical movement, allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in <b>their</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up <b>their</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Hurricane Warning Service, {{operated}} by the United States Weather Bureau and the predecessor to the National Hurricane Center, issued hurricane warnings from Fort Myers to Miami, including the Florida Keys on October4. Miami Weather Bureau chief Grady Norton urged residents to take precautions and concentrate on further advisories. On October5, the hurricane warning was revised to include Naples to Jupiter. Additionally, other warnings were issued for areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee due to flooding concerns. Four U.S. Navy wartime housing project areas in Key West were evacuated. About 100Seminoles fled the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation, with 95% of the property still inundated from the September hurricane. Two 25-car trains evacuated about 5,000people in the Lake Okeechobee area in Lake Harbor and transported them to Sebring. Many residents throughout South Florida boarded-up <b>their</b> <b>windows</b> and sandbagged their properties. The American Red Cross opened 143shelters, which 21,663people sought refuge in.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{news of the}} storm, {{businesses}} in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive plate glass windows. Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200–5,000 residents, {{most of whom were}} black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds. Aday before the storm, the lake level reached , heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake. The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and coffee to evacuees. On the west coast of the state, some residents covered <b>their</b> <b>windows,</b> but many others did not, anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm. Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left their homes for safety, while boaters secured their vessels.|$|E
