5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat undermined {{by the fact that the}} latter disappears from <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Æthelhard's family {{background}} or early life, however {{it is assumed that}} he was a native of Mercia.

He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester sometime after 759 and before 778.|$|E

5|$|Some {{legends of}} the Kami and Cahuilla tribes {{probably}} refer to Lake Cahuilla. They state that the lake bed tended to be dry but also occasionally flooded; during which times the tribes would have to relocate to the mountains.

5|$|The first certain {{appearance}} of Halley's Comet in <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> is a description from 240BC, in the Chinese chronicle Records of the Grand Historian or Shiji, which describes a comet {{that appeared in}} the east and moved north.

5|$|The first written {{records of}} native {{life in the}} Hebrides begin in the 6th century AD with the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata. Much of what is known of these times is the product of the monastic sites such as Iona, Lismore, Eigg and Tiree but north of Dál Riata, where the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> is sparse.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> {{contains}} {{few details}} of Romulus' life. He {{was the son}} of Orestes, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of Attila the Hun before coming into the service of Julius Nepos in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of magister militum, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of Ravenna under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, {{was little more than a}} child and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, after which he disappears from <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|Theobald was {{the patron}} of his {{successor}} Thomas Becket, {{and a number}} of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks. During his time as archbishop Theobald augmented the rights of his see, or bishopric. Historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record,</b> mainly because of the fame of his successor.|$|E
5|$|After {{a number}} of failed marriages {{throughout}} the 40s, she {{spent much of the}} remainder of her life at the court of her brother Herod Agrippa II, amidst rumors the two were carrying on an incestuous relationship. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began a love affair with the future emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus. However, her unpopularity among the Romans compelled Titus to dismiss her on his accession as emperor in 79. When he died two years later, she disappeared from <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|By 1500, the {{population}} had expanded considerably. There {{were at least}} five mound centers (although the Shoulderbone site's population had declined dramatically) and several hundred smaller towns and other settlements. Ocute enters <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> in the chronicles of the expedition of Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto, which came through the chiefdom in 1539 {{on its way to}} Cofitachequi. They had learned about Ocute from two young men they had captured in Apalachee in present-day Florida.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant. What is known is that {{the crew of the}} ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> misses.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b> This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|Neville first {{appears in}} <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> as the butler of Count Waleran of Meulan in 1138. Neville {{may have been}} in Waleran's service prior to this, {{but this is the first}} secure appearance. For serving as butler, Neville {{received}} rents from the market dues at Pont-Audemer worth 100 shillings annually. He appears as a witness to a charter of Waleran's to the Abbey of Tiron, which is dated sometime before 1141. Neville witnessed ten other of Waleran's charters, ending in the 1150s.|$|E
5|$|Robert's first {{appearance}} in <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> is at Ramsey Abbey sometime between 1114 and 1123, where he appears as a witness to a charter. A further appearance is in a document of his brother Walter dating between 1130 and 1139. It is likely that Robert was a canon of York Cathedral before 1147. He is also claimed to have held the office of Provost of Beverley Minster as the immediate predecessor to Thomas Becket, but this is unlikely, as Becket did not become provost until 1154, long after Robert had become Dean of York.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Adams {{later became}} a {{controversial}} figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before {{the outbreak of the}} Revolutionary War. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{representation of}} Charlie Company's actions, led by its commander, Captain Ralph E. Goranson, was well maintained {{in the opening}} sequence.

5|$|The next {{mention of}} Qatna after the Story of Sinuhe comes from Mari in the 18th century BC, {{during the reign}} of Išḫi-Addu of Qatna. However, a tablet found in Tuttul, dating to the early reign of the Mariote king Yahdun-Lim in the late 19th century BC, {{mentions}} a king named Amut-piʾel, who is most probably the father of Išḫi-Addu; this would make him the first known king of Qatna. Also {{during the reign of}} Yahdun-Lim, the kingdom of Yamhad in Aleppo and its king Sumu-Epuh enter <b>the</b> <b>historical</b> <b>record</b> through the texts of Mari.|$|E
