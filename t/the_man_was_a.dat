He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 2006, a 20-year-old male park {{employee}} from Birdseye, Indiana {{died after}} being pinned under the lawn mower he was using. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> supervisor for the park's grounds department.

The man was found by another employee, who was then able to help lift the lawn mower off the victim with the help of other employees. Park emergency medical technicians and Spencer County EMS summoned a medical helicopter from St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center in Evansville, Indiana, but the employee was pronounced dead before it arrived.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{sought to}} suppress information about captured personnel. On 27 December 1941, it established a POW Information Bureau within the Ministry of the Army to manage information concerning Japanese POWs. While the Bureau cataloged {{information provided by}} the Allies via the Red Cross identifying POWs, it did not pass this information on {{to the families of the}} prisoners. When individuals wrote to the Bureau to inquire if their relative had been taken prisoner, it appears that the Bureau provided a reply which neither confirmed or denied whether <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> prisoner. Although the Bureau's role included facilitating mail between POWs and their families, this was not carried out as the families were not notified and few POWs wrote home. The lack of communication with their families increased the POWs feelings of being cut off from Japanese society.|$|E

25|$|On 11 October 2011, the {{struggle}} between the Metros and the Rojos intensified when the Mexican authorities found the body of César Dávila García inside an abandoned house in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Inside the abandoned house, the corpse of El Comandante Gama, Dávila García's code name, had been shot with a 9 mm pistol. According to the Mexican authorities, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> top financial operator in the Gulf Cartel and a close associate of the former drug lord Antonio Cárdenas Guillén. After the drug lord's death, Dávila García became the regional drug baron of the coastal city of Tampico, Tamaulipas before moving back to Matamoros. Neither faction in the Gulf Cartel claimed responsibility for his death, but Mexican intelligence sources indicated that Dávila García was killed by the Metros. The assassination also happened {{a day after the}} Mexican Navy dismantled a network of the Gulf Cartel in three municipalities across Tamaulipas, where 35 cartel members were arrested. Ricardo Salazar Pequeño, the regional boss of the cartel in Ciudad Miguel Alemán, along with the cartel's accountant Gabriela Gómez Robles, were apprehended. In addition, several firearms, drug loads, and radio communication equipment were confiscated.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 2009, {{two days}} after the {{original}} incident, the crew of another Flight 253 requested emergency assistance with a Nigerian passenger whom they said had become [...] "verbally disruptive".

500|$|The larger middle {{inscription}} is in French, using a 12th-century script. It reads [...] "LEAL SOVVENIR" [...] (Loyal Remembrance, or Faithful Souvenir), and {{is painted}} {{to give the}} impression that it was carved into the parapet. In 1927 Hippolyte Fierens Gevaert put forward Timotheus of Miletus, a Greek musician and dithyrambic poet born [...] 446. Gevaert held that the portrait was a commemoration of a court artist who had recently died and that the classical reference was intended to flatter his memory. Panofsky largely went with this position in 1949. He speculated that the sitter was the celebrated musician Gilles Binchois, by 1430 a canon at St. Donatian's Cathedral, Bruges. Campbell is sceptical, disclaiming that the sitter [...] "is not dressed as a cleric". Other theories include that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Greek or Lucchese merchant, Henry the Navigator, Jean deCroÿ or, less likely, that it is a self-portrait. Though there is much disagreement, it is probable that he was a native French speaker, and a notary, poet, or member of the Compagnie du Chapel Vert ("Society of the Green Hat") at Tournai. Dhanens rejects the theory that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> musician on the basis that vanEyck would have made this explicit, portraying him holding a device or emblem clearly symbolising music. She concludes that he is an accountant or lawyer holding a legal or financial document.|$|E

Yet, Gale felt, any assessment of Hay must include negatives as well, that after his marriage to the wealthy Clara Stone, Hay [...] "allowed his deep-seated love of ease triumph over his Middle Western devotion to work and a fair shake for all." [...] Despite his literary accomplishments, Hay [...] "was often lazy. [...] His first poetry was his best." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 May 2017, Malaysia Airlines Flight 128, {{operated}} by an Airbus A330-300 9M-MTI to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), returned to Melbourne after a passenger attempted {{to enter the}} cockpit, which was prevented by other passengers and the flight crew. The overweight aircraft landed safely, landing on runway 16, 15 minutes after departure. Passengers were not disembarked until about 90 minutes after landing. Malaysia Airlines reported {{that they would like}} to stress that at no point was the aircraft [...] "hijacked".

500|$|From {{the first}} two inscriptions, the panel is {{generally}} accepted as a posthumous portrait. Roman tombstones often showed {{a representation of the}} deceased behind a parapet with a carved inscription, and vanEyck may have known of these from travels to France. The lower inscription reads [...] "Actu ano dni.1432.10.die ocobris.a.ioh de Eyck" [...] (These are done in the year of our Lord 1432 on the 10th day of October by Jan vanEyck). Campbell observes that the phrasing of this extended signature is surprisingly reminiscent of legalese, and that vanEyck seems to be reinforcing the idea that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> legal professional, who may have worked for the Dukes of Burgundy. Jacques Paviot notes that it is written in the Gothic cursive script bastarda, then favoured by the legal profession. In either case, although he is not grandly dressed and is probably a member of the middle class, he must have been highly regarded in Philip's court, given that such portraits rarely depicted non-nobles.|$|E

500|$|Leod's name is {{represented}} in Scottish Gaelic as Leòd. This name is a Gaelic form of the Old Norse Ljótr, meaning [...] "ugly". Matheson stated that this Norse name was rare in both Scandinavia and Iceland. He noted that in Scotland it was peculiar to the MacLeods, though it is almost never used within the clan. Matheson speculated that Leod's great-grandfather would have likely flourished {{at about the same}} time as Olvir Rosta was supposedly exiled to the Outer Hebrides. Matheson went even father and proposed that Leod's great-grandfather was in fact Olvir Rosta—a character from the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga. Matheson noted that while the name Ljótr is rare, Olvir Rosta's maternal grandfather appears in the saga as Ljótr níðingr ('Ljótr Villain'). In Matheson's opinion, since the Gaelic-language genealogies are inconsistent in the generations further back than Leod's great-grandfather, this may show that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> newcomer in the area. Sellar, however, rejected Matheson's proposal, commenting that such evidence was entirely circumstantial. Sellar stated that Olvir was not such a rare name; also, Olvir Rosta's genealogy and family within the saga (see above right) has no similarity with that recorded in the Gaelic-language genealogies relevant to Leod.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his summing-up. He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth. It {{is a question of}} belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case as hard as he can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of a conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not that different from the original." ...|$|E
