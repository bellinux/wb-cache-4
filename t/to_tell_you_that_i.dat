[...] In the same interview, he stated that the {{cognitive}} part of his mind was [...] "untouched" [...] and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA). However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, saying: [...] "the Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments".|$|E
500|$|Haley {{writes that}} during {{the last months of}} MalcolmX's life [...] "uncertainty and confusion" [...] about his views were {{widespread}} in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death MalcolmX said, [...] "I'm man enough <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible." [...] MalcolmX had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology {{at the time of his}} assassination and, Dyson writes, was [...] "experiencing a radical shift" [...] in his core [...] "personal and political understandings".|$|E

[...] Later that evening, Gallagher confirmed he had left Oasis as he [...] "simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer." [...] Through the Oasis website, he said [...] "It's with some sadness and great relief <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> quit Oasis tonight". On 29 August, Gallagher expanded further on his blog, stating [...] "the level of verbal and violent intimidation towards me, my family, friends and comrades has become intolerable. And the lack of support and understanding from my management and band mates has left me with no other option than to get me cape and seek pastures new." ...|$|E

After suspending his campaign, the former Maryland governor gave a speech, saying - [...] "Tonight, I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am suspending this Presidential bid.

2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long enough for me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and {{my job is to}} enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to [...] "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates accused Hanson {{of racism and}} stupidity. Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between my argument above {{and the notion that}} black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats.

2500|$|The {{condition}} {{of education in}} Nesna at the beginning o the 19th century was described as [...] "lamentable". The education Augustinussen himself had received had mainly been from home and through the priest who lent him books. When he was asked in parliament where he studied, he answered: [...] "Actually I ought <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was taught at home next to the stove by my mother". It was the curate {{who was responsible for}} teaching, and Nesna had been saddled with several awful curates. The curate Müller, in 1811, had to resign his post [...] "due to adultery", and his successor Peter Eggen, who was curate during Augustinussen's childhood and early years, had little more success. He was a cobbler without any pedagogical qualifications and liked to drink and [...] "chase women". Jenssen writes that [...] "he had nothing to teach + {{for the simple reason that}} he knew nothing". The pastor at the time Christian Qvale testified that [...] "He combined lewdness with the greatest incompetence" [...], whilst the later priest Dometius wrote of Eggen that «Han cultivated both Bacchus and Venus and was a general annoyance".|$|E
2500|$|Vanderbilt's {{best player}} {{that day was}} Hek Wakefield, {{showcasing}} his skill in tackling Michigan's runners. [...] "I never saw a greater exhibition of end play," [...] said Fielding Yost, referring to Wakefield. The Kingsport Times reported that governor Austin Peay had given Hek praise for his play that day. Thomas Ryan also had a fine game, out-punting the famed Harry Kipke. The Michigan Alumnus attributed this to Ryan's superior line, claiming Kipke was under constant threat of a blocked punt. The Alumnus also said Kipke could not seek to return punts, for fear of fumbling. As soon as he received the ball, Vanderbilt ends Hek Wakefield or Lynn Bomar would crash into him. After the game, the referee McDonald approached guard Tuck Kelly and told him, [...] "You are the first individual I've complimented after {{a game in which}} I officiated, but I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never saw a better guard than you are." [...] Steger was Michigan's best runner that day. [...] The Wolverines' backfield having three men who could pass the ball in Kipke, Steger, and Uteritz, was said to help them throughout the game by vexing Vanderbilt's secondary.|$|E
2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun {{with his right hand}} and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move! Fuck!” Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|E

2500|$|A {{result was}} never {{likely in the}} 4th Supertest at Bourda. When the Australians landed at Guyana they {{discovered}} it had been raining for days. On the scheduled first day play was abandoned before the players had even left for the ground. That evening the pitch was still underwater. On the second day {{the rain had stopped}} and it was hot and sunny. Yet the two captains, Chappell and Lloyd, decided the condition of the outfield was unfit for play, Greg Chappell describing it as a [...] "quagmire". Unfortunately for the cricketers and officials at Bourda, thousands of spectators had been allowed into the ground that morning. Ian Chappell recalls how he was visited in the dressing-rooms by the local Chief of Police and told, [...] "If there is no play today, I am afraid <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can no longer guarantee your safety at the ground." [...] The consensus was that there must, therefore, be some sort of play. The captains and umpires agreed to start play at 4pm and play for roughly an hour until the light faded. However a misinformed PA announced to the crowd that play would begin at 3pm. This enraged the volatile Chappell who then reneged on the deal and refused to play. The crowd, many of whom had been drinking rum and partying all day, sensed no play and began a riot. Both teams and the officials were locked in their dressing rooms. The Australians donned their new batting helmets and took guard with their bats, behind the bolted door. The rioters attacked the pavilion causing major damage and a couple of unnamed West Indian cricketers suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Chappell recalls a conversation after the event with West Indian wicketkeeper Deryck Murray. Murray insisted that the riot was a result of growing unhappiness at the Guyanan president Arthur Chung and that they used the abandoned cricket as an excuse. He believed that the rioters would never have intentionally harmed any of the cricketers. The words reassured some of the Australians, but many wanted to leave Guyana immediately and head to the next island, while some (about eight, which is half the squad) were considering returning to Australia. Chappell demanded his players stay and play, making a statement to the West Indian fans that they are not intimidated and will play to win. Play proceeded on the third morning as if nothing had happened. The ground was cleared of broken glass and the game played out to a draw with a century from Greg Chappell confirming his status as the outstanding batsman of the series.|$|E
