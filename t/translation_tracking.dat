All trackers are evaluated for the task of pure <b>translation</b> <b>tracking,</b> as well as tracking translation plus scaling. For the evaluation, we use a publically available, labeled data set consisting of surveillance videos of humans in public spaces.

40|$|Ocean wave {{characteristics}} {{in the western}} Atlantic Ocean (Hurricane Region) to tropical cyclones have been well identified, but not the regional seas in the western Pacific, e. g., the South China Sea (Typhoon Region). This {{is due to the}} lack of observational and modeling studies in the regional seas of the western Pacific. To fill this gap, Wavewatch-III (WW 3) is used to study the response of the South China Sea (SCS) to Typhoon Muifa (2004). The major purposes are to find the similarity and dissimilarity of wave characteristics between the two regions, and to evaluate the WW 3 capability to typhoon forcing. The WW 3 model is integrated from the JONSWAP wave spectra with a tropical cyclone wind profile model, simulating Typhoon Muifa, from 16 to 25 November 2004. This study shows strong similarities in the responses between Hurricane and Typhoon Regions, including strong asymmetry in the significant wave height (Hs) along the typhoon <b>translation</b> <b>track</b> with the maximum Hs in the right-front quadrant of the typhoon center, and asymmetry in the directional wave spectra at different locations (frontward, backward, rightward, and leftward) around the typhoon center.

40|$|In current {{statistical}} {{machine translation}} (SMT), erroneous word reordering {{is one of the}} most serious problems. To resolve this problem, many word-reordering constraint techniques have been proposed. The inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is one of these constraints. In ITG constraints, targetside word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side binary tree. In these node rotations, the source binary tree instance is not considered. Therefore, stronger constraints for word reordering can be obtained by imposing further constraints derived from the source tree on the ITG constraints. For example, for the source word sequence { a b c d}, ITG constraints allow a total of twenty-two target word orderings. However, when the source binary tree instance ((a b) (c d)) is given, our proposed ”imposing source tree on ITG ” (IST-ITG) constraints allow only eight word orderings. The reduction in the number of word-order permutations by our proposed stronger constraints efficiently suppresses erroneous word orderings. In our experiments with IST-ITG using the NIST MT 08 English-to-Chinese <b>translation</b> <b>track’s</b> data, the proposed method resulted in a 1. 8 -points improvement in character BLEU- 4 (35. 2 to 37. 0) and a 6. 2 % lower CER (74. 1 to 67. 9 %) compared with our baseline condition. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{tracking}} Euclidean motion is formu-lated as a sequential learning of rotations and <b>translations.</b> For <b>tracking</b> modalities such as radar and sonar, this approach avoids a fundamental mismatch that arises with standard trackers that model motion dynamics in Cartesian coordinates but track based on measurements whose noise is best modeled in polar coordinates. By considering motion {{in terms of}} rotations and translations and using group-theoretic estimation, the proposed tracker enjoys the advantage of unbiased averaging on the rotation group, {{in accordance with the}} geometry of the measure-ments. We demonstrate the proposed method with illustrative preliminary experiments. The stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, extending known convergence results for online learning of rotations. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuman {{observers}} cannot judge heading accurately in {{the presence}} of simulated gaze rotations under many conditions [Royden et al. (1994). Vision Research, 34, 3197 – 3214]. They make errors in the direction of rotation with magnitudes proportional to the rotation rate. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain this phenomenon. The extra-retinal-signal hypothesis states that the observer's estimate of gaze rotation is always based on an extra-retinal signal such as an efference copy. In the absence of such a signal, the observer assumes that no rotation has taken place and responds accordingly. The retinal-image hypothesis states that visual input dominates when the extra-retinal signal is small or absent; under this hypothesis, errors with simulated rotations are the consequence of faulty visual mechanisms. Perrone and Stone (1994). [Vision Research, 34, 2917 – 2938] proposed a model that purports to account for these errors using retinal-image information (optic flow) alone; its assumptions make it inefficient under some conditions. The most important of these assumptions is that the fixated target is stationary with respect to the world (the gaze-stabilization constraint). I compared the model's performance to human data from two experiments of Royden et al. (1994). [Vision Research, 34, 3197 – 3214]. One experiment simulated <b>translation</b> while <b>tracking</b> a target attached to the scene (gaze-stabilized), while the other simulated <b>translation</b> while <b>tracking</b> a target that was not attached (gaze-unstabilized). The incorporation of the gaze-stabilization constraint leads to a predicted asymmetry for the errors in the gaze-unstabilized experiment that is not observed in human data. I conclude that the model as it stands is not consistent with human behavior. It is possible, however, that the predicted asymmetry is masked in human data by a counteracting asymmetry in a hypothetical processing stage subsequent to the heading estimation that extrapolates the observer's future path of self-motion. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In {{real-time}} {{facial expression}} recognition, accurate and fast face tracking {{is a very}} important preparatory part to obtain the image sequence s of facial expressions. For this problem, an improved mean shift algorithm is proposed for real-time face tracking. F acial expression image sequence s are obtained with the method. The method is based on using pixel gray value distribution as the feature as well as combination of the density distribution of the objective gradient direction. A lternating iterative operation s can be carried through the iterative formula of these two features, and thus, we can make the human face rotation and <b>translation</b> movement <b>tracking</b> better. Then we used the geometric model based on human face to locate the region of facial expression features, and estimate the optical flow to calculate the Eigen-flow vectors. Finally, hidden semi-Markov model is used for facial expression recognition s. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively track the face under rotation and translation movement of the head and it is very effective to obtain the facial expression image sequence s     quickly and accurately. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Microsoft Research (MSR) {{system for the}} evaluation campaign of the 2011 international workshop on spoken language translation. The evaluation task is to translate TED talks (www. ted. com). This task presents two unique challenges: First, the underlying topic switches sharply from talk to talk. Therefore, the translation system needs {{to adapt to the}} current topic quickly and dynamically. Second, only a very small amount of relevant parallel data (transcripts of TED talks) is available. Therefore, it is necessary to perform accurate translation model estimation with limited data. In the preparation for the evaluation, we developed two new methods to attack these problems. Specifically, we developed an unsupervised topic modeling based adaption method for machine translation models. We also developed a discriminative training method to estimate parameters in the generative components of the translation models with limited data.

Objectives: To determine whether differences in humeral translations exist between patients with shoulder impingement symptoms and an asymptomatic comparison group, and if so, to determine if shoulder range-of-motion (ROM) measures are associated with abnormal translations. Background: Abnormal translations of the humeral head are believed to reduce the available subacromial space and {{to contribute to the}} development or progression of shoulder impingement symptoms. These abnormal translations have also been theorized to be related to tightness of the posterior capsule and decreased shoulder ROM. Methods and Measures: Three-dimensional humeral <b>translations</b> were <b>tracked</b> in symptomatic construction workers and an asymptomatic comparison group while elevating the arm in the scapular plane under no-load, 2. 3 -kg, and 4. 6 -kg hand-load conditions.
