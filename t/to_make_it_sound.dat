5|$|Thomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on WALL-E {{since the}} two got along well on Nemo, which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, {{in the hope that}} {{starting}} this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged {{for the first time in}} October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too.|$|E
25|$|Dimon {{was born}} in New York City, to {{children}} of Greek immigrants Theodore and Themis (née Kalos) Dimon. One of three sons, he is of Greek descent and Greek Orthodox and attended The Browning School in his youth. His paternal grandfather was a Greek immigrant who changed the family name from Papademetriou to Dimon <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more French, {{and worked as a}} banker in Smyrna and Athens. He has an older brother, Peter, and a fraternal twin brother, Ted. Dimon's father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at Shearson.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the new site as a whole required some of the existing Grade II structure of the hospital to be demolished. This was allowed on the account that these parts were not of significant architectural or historical interest to justify preserving. However, the south boundary wall (a registered ancient monument) had to undergo some renovation work <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> again. The old artesian well was considered an important Victorian artifact and was left intact. This required {{the foundations of the}} new unit to be built a little further to the south than originally intended.|$|E

5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{rated the}} song four stars out of five, saying that [...] "the easy, mid-tempo swinger is {{another in a}} long line of hits that gives one no reason to turn down the radio.

25|$|Zhong Hui {{had long}} harboured the {{intention}} of rebelling against Wei. When he saw that Deng Ai behaved in an autocratic manner even though his military command was authorised by the Wei imperial court, he secretly reported to the court that Deng was plotting a rebellion. He was skilled in imitating people's handwriting. After getting his hands on a report written by Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court, he edited the report <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai to increase Sima's suspicions towards Deng. The Wei government fell for Zhong Hui's ruse and ordered Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to Luoyang in a prison cart. Sima Zhao was worried that Deng Ai would not submit, so he ordered Zhong Hui and Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai. With Zhong Hui and his troops following behind, Wei Guan went to Deng Ai's camp in Chengdu and used Sima Zhao's letter of authorisation to order Deng's soldiers to put down their weapons. Deng Ai was arrested {{and placed in a}} prison cart.|$|E
500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> real and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E

[...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called the recording an [...] "infectious cumbia [...]" [...] The recording has been released in several compilation albums including, Anthology (1998), Y Sus Inicios, Vol. 1 (2003), Y Sus Inicios, Vol. 2 (2004) and Classic Series, Vol. 1 (2006).|$|E

500|$|For the single's B-side, Lomax {{recorded}} his composition [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You". Produced by Harrison, {{the song was}} also recorded between 24 and 26 June. According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis, the musicians on the track comprised an [...] "ad hoc power trio" [...] of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar, Harrison on lead guitar and [...] "a couple of overdubs", and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated. Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part (played by a studio cleaner) and then manipulated the recording <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like the call of an elephant.|$|E
500|$|The {{score was}} {{recorded}} with a forty-piece orchestra. Jones formatted the orchestra {{to generate a}} bigger sound than normally heard on television soundtracks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more like Goldsmith's The Motion Picture score. Keyboards were {{used to make the}} cellos more prominent, and other changes included an increase in the mid-range of the string section. The soundtrack to [...] "Where No One Has Gone Before" [...] was released (as part of The Ron Jones Project box set of Star Trek: The Next Generation scores) in a limited run of 5,000 copies in 2010 by Film Score Monthly.|$|E

500|$|While touring on the Clash of the Titans tour {{to promote}} the 1990 studio album Seasons in the Abyss, {{separate}} sections of the Decade of Aggression album were recorded on October 14, 1990, March 8, 1991, and July 13, 1991, however, AllMusic said that Rick Rubin's production [...] "seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like this is all one gig." [...] Although it had a working title of Decade of Decadence, it would be released as Decade of Aggression after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album. It was released through Def American Recordings on October 22, 1991.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a love connection, where the protagonist makes bad decisions; [...] "I never was smart with love, I let the bad ones in and the good ones go".

[...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noted that Robyn sings [...] "tough and knowing" [...] and [...] "pessimistically optimistic" [...] lines, but manages <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> romantic for the listener. Emma Gaedekke of Billboard commented on the lyrical content, saying, [...] "Robyn's heartfelt vocal turn {{prevents}} the backing music from overwhelming her story of a love connection found at the tail-end of heartbreak." ...|$|E
500|$|Hot Chip often {{record their}} {{music in a}} bedroom.

Recording {{took place in a}} variety of locations, including in-studio and live venues, to make [...] "different acoustic spaces to be obvious to the listener". Lead vocalist Alexis Taylor said there was tension between the band's members, as the band did not want to continue creating music in the same way, but also did not want to [...] "throw away a songwriting and production partnership that has worked before." [...] Taylor and vocalist Joe Goddard worked on some of the songs together. Several songs were overdubbed with parts {{of the rest of the}} band playing.|$|E

She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things.

500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|Take Me Home {{was written}} in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. [...] "The Swedish-style songwriting: melody first" [...] was {{predominantly}} utilised, according to Time correspondent Douglas Wolk. Savan Kotecha, Yacoub, and Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm, Sweden, developing songs for the album, {{and were able to}} shape melodies around their tones. Kotecha reflected: [...] "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult". In addition, after viewing the international success of [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", the trio conceptualised songs [...] "that kids could play on guitar and cover on YouTube." ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{then the}} club's {{operations}} have been reformed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> financial <b>sound</b> {{or at least}} not running on deficit. The team, having {{been one of the most}} successful and high stature in Finland, had been on run of deficit for several years during the 2000s. At the same time the overall economic situation in the world and also the sponsorship payments from UPM Kymmene diminished. This forced the club to rationalize its operations and adopt a new role as one of the smaller clubs in Finnish top flight football. The current situation at the start of 2012 Finnish football season is described by the current chairman and board members as difficult but stable.|$|R

500|$|Grohl's garage was {{equipped}} with microphones, sound baffles on the garage door and behind the drums to prevent sound leakings, and a carpet under the drum kit <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> less [...] "loud and bright". To reduce the cymbal bleed, the microphones were rearranged and the crash cymbal was traded for a [...] "shorter-decay Zildjian cymbal with holes drilled in it". A room next to the study was turned into an isolation booth to record the vocals. For the recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on the backyard, and a system of two cameras and a television provided the communication between the garage and the control room. The equipment was the same the band employed to record the albums There Is Nothing Left to Lose and One by One at Grohl's former house in Alexandria, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, the Simpsons are {{floating}} down a river on a shield. At one point, the family is seen by two Africans, who speak in Kiswahili. Additionally, the song that Kitenge sings when driving the Simpsons ("Wé-Wé" [...] by Angélique Kidjo) was a popular song in Africa. In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> accurate, Hank Azaria, who portrays Kitenge in the episode, was taught to sing the song phonetically by a professor in Swahili in the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Joan Bushwell, the [...] "Jane Goodall-type" [...] character in the episode, was portrayed by American voice actress Tress MacNeille, who also voices Lindsey Naegle among other characters in the series.

500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] came {{together}} {{near the end}} of the recording sessions when audio engineer Flood was mixing the song and introduced distortion to the drums.

Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, [...] "Let's just try something that's gonna put me in a completely different place". After they distorted his voice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different [...] "emotional feel". Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording.|$|E

In formal music, bell patterns are also played on the metal shell of the timbales, and drum kit cymbals.|$|R
