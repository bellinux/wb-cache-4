50|$|The {{mechanism}} of NA {{has been shown}} to proceed with the retention of configuration which means it preserves the absolute configuration on the atom in the stereocenter. There are four steps of catalytic pathways. In the first step, the binding step, the carboxylate group changes from the axial position into the pseudo-equatorial position. The second step is the proton donation from water molecule and formation of the endocyclic sialosyl cation <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate.</b> Step three involves nucleophilic attack of tyrosine on the sialosyl cation. The fourth step is the formation and release of Neu5Ac. A similar mechanism has been proposed by Janakiraman et al. where the double bond of Neu5Ac2en forces the pyranose of sugar ring into a planar structure were resembled the transition-state structure.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBacterial {{translation}} termination {{is mediated}} by release factors RF 1 and RF 2, which recognize stop codons and catalyze hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond. The catalytic mechanism has been debated. We {{proposed that the}} backbone amide NH group, rather than the side chain, of the glutamine of the universally conserved GGQ motif participates in catalysis by H-bonding to the tetrahedral <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate</b> and by product stabilization. This was supported by complete loss of RF 1 catalytic activity when glutamine is replaced by proline, the only residue that lacks a backbone NH group. Here, we present the 3. 4  Å crystal structure of the ribosome complex containing the RF 2 Q 253 P mutant and find that its fold, including the GGP sequence, is virtually identical to that of wild-type RF 2. This rules out proline-induced misfolding and further supports the proposal that catalytic activity requires interaction of the Gln- 253 backbone amide with the 3 ′ end of peptidyl-tRNA...|$|E
40|$|Conversion of {{methanol}} over H-ZSM- 22 : The {{reaction mechanism}} and deactivationConversion of methanol to olefins (MTO) over H-ZSM- 22 {{was carried out}} in the pulse and the continuous-flow reaction systems. (13) C labeling technique was used to reveal the reaction mechanism. The materials retained in the deactivated catalyst were detected by GC-MS after dissolving the catalyst framework and then extracting the organic species. The adsorption of these materials in ZSM- 22 channels was computationally modeled. The results showed that the olefin methylation-cracking mechanism is the main route for the conversion of methanol over H-ZSM- 22. It was suggested that the blockage of the zeolite pore openings by the coke species might be the reason of the relatively rapid deactivation of H-ZSM- 22, instead of the prohibition of the formation of large <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediates</b> involved in hydrocarbon pool mechanism.

40|$|The {{influence}} of centrifugal repulsion on the real-time photofragmentation dynamics of (quasi) diatomic molecules is investigated. A previously presented classical model (Bersohn, R.; Zewail, A. H. Ber. Bunsenges. Phys. Chem. 1988, 92, 373) for direct dissociation in one (translatory) dimension is invoked {{to mimic the}} transient behavior that can be monitored experimentally by femtosecond transition-state spectroscopy. The time-dependent absorption of the probing laser pulse is calculated at transition-state and final product configurations for dissociation with varying amounts of relative rotational angular momentum between separating fragments. In this way, the centrifugal contribution to the potential governing fragmentation is examined {{in terms of its}} effect on the characteristic dissociation times for product separation and the lifetimes of <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediates.</b> Application is made to the photodissociation of ICN via the A continuum, for which it is shown that centrifugal repulsion is not the principal cause of the observed product rotation...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the decomposition pathways of 1, 3, 3 -trinitroazetidine (TNAZ) is described. Possible decomposition <b>transition-states,</b> <b>intermediates,</b> and products are identified and structures, energies, and vibrational frequencies are determined at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d,p) level for these species. Four major pathways are apparent. Two pathways are initiated by the fission of the N 8 ̆ 211 NO 2 and C 8 ̆ 211 NO 2 bonds to yield radical intermediates, while the other two pathways involve the molecular elimination of HONO. Energy profiles for the pathways and possible routes {{to some of the}} experimentally observed species of TNAZ decomposition are presented. The energy required to initiate the NO 2 bond fission pathways are 48 ̆ 2118 kcal/mol lower than the HONO elimination pathways. In the gas phase, the NO 2 elimination pathways will be the dominant routes for TNAZ decomposition. In the condensed phase, however, this trend may be reversed.

40|$|The human multidrug {{resistance}} protein (MDR 1) (P-glycoprotein), {{a member of}} the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, causes {{multidrug resistance}} by an active transport mechanism, which keeps the intracellular level of hydrophobic compounds below a cell-killing threshold. Human MDR 1 variants with mutations affecting a conserved glycine residue within the ABC signature of either or both ABC units (G 534 D, G 534 V, G 1179 D and G 534 D/G 1179 D) were expressed and characterized in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9) cell membranes. These mutations caused a loss of measurable ATPase activity but still allowed ATP binding and the formation of a <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate</b> (nucleotide trapping). In contrast with the wild-type protein, in which substrate drugs accelerate nucleotide trapping, in the ABC signature mutants nucleotide trapping was inhibited by MDR 1 -substrate drugs, suggesting a miscommunication between the drug-binding site(s) and the catalytic domains. Equivalent mutations of the two catalytic sites resulted in a similar effect, indicating the functional equivalence of the two sites. On the basis of these results and recent structural information on an ABC-ABC dimer [Hopfner, Karcher, Shin, Craig, Arthur, Carney and Tainer (2000) Cell 101, 789 - 800], we propose a key role of these glycine residues in the interdomain communication regulating drug-induced ATP hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|Diphtheria toxin (DT) {{has been}} studied {{as a model for}} {{understanding}} active-site structure and function in the ADP-ribosyltransferases. Earlier evidence suggested that histidine- 21 of DT is important for the ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF- 2). We have generated substitutions of this residue by cassette mutagenesis of a synthetic gene encoding the catalytic A fragment (DTA) of DT, and have characterized purified mutant forms of this domain. Changing histidine- 21 to alanine, aspartic acid, leucine, glutamine, or arginine diminished ADP-ribosylation activity by 70 -fold or greater. In contrast, asparagine proved to be a functionally conservative substitution, which reduced ADP-ribosylation activity by < 3 -fold. The asparagine mutant was approximately 50 -fold-attenuated in NAD glycohydrolase activity, however. Dissociation constants (Kd) for NAD binding, determined by quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence, were 15 microM for wild-type DTA, 160 microM for the asparagine mutant, and greater than 500 microM NAD for the alanine, leucine, glutamine, and arginine mutants. These and previous results support a model of the ADP-ribosylation of EF- 2 in which histidine- 21 serves primarily a hydrogen-bonding function. We propose that the pi-imidazole nitrogen of His- 21 hydrogen-bonds to the nicotinamide carboxamide, orienting the N-glycosidic bond of NAD for attack by the incoming nucleophile in a direct displacement mechanism, and then stabilizing the <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate</b> of this reaction...|$|E
40|$|Tissue-type {{transglutaminase}} is irreversibly inactivated during heat treatment. The rate of inactivation is low at pH 7. 5; {{it increases}} slightly at acid pH (6. 1) {{but much more}} at alkaline pH (9. 0 - 9. 5), suggesting that specific effects {{take place in the}} alkaline range, possibly in relation to decreased stability of the <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate</b> as pH is raised above 9. 0. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments indicate that thermal unfolding of the protein occurs with two separate transitions, involving independent regions of the enzyme. They are assigned to domains 1 and 2 and domains 3 and 4, respectively, by a combination of calorimetric and spectroscopic techniques. When considering the effects of pH, we noted that transglutaminase was unfolded via different pathways at the different pH values considered. At acid pH, the whole structure of the protein was lost irreversibly, with massive aggregation. At neutral and, even more so, at alkaline pH, aggregation was absent (or very limited at high protein concentration) and the loss of secondary structure was dependent on the ionization state of crucial lysine residues. Unfolding at pH 9. 5 apparently chiefly involved the N-terminal region, as testified by changes in protein intrinsic fluorescence. In addition, the C-terminal region was destabilized at each pH value tested during thermal unfolding, as shown by digestion with V 8 proteinase, which is inactive on the native protein. Evidence was obtained that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions interact with each other in determining the structure of the native protein...|$|E

Density Functional Theory using the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d) method for geometry optimizations and thermodynamic analyses has been employed for the prediction of reaction enthalpies and rate-constant parameters for the partial oxidation of cyclohexane in single-gauze chemical reactors. The model examined includes 28 species and 44 irreversible (22 reversible) gas-phase reactions.

Density-functional theory (DFT) {{is used for the}} prediction of reaction enthalpies and rate-constant parameters for the partial oxidation of cyclohexane in single-gauze millisecond reactors. The model includes 31 species and 46 elementary gas-phase reactions. The energetics of major gas-phase reaction channels are probed by locating stable reactants, products, and <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediates.</b> One-dimensional plug-flow reactor simulations are carried out using the DFT mechanism, but only qualitative agreement with experimental data is obtained. A crucial issue is the presence of rapid thermal gradients near the catalyst wire, because fast quenching of hot unstable intermediates in the wake region of the gauze allows highly non-equilibrium species to be preserved. This effect is only well-simulated with a two-dimensional geometry. A detailed two-dimensional model of the 40 -mesh Pt– 10 %Rh single-gauze catalyst is solved using computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Acylphosphatase (ACP) {{is a low}} {{molecular}} weight phosphomonohydrolase catalyzing with high specificity the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond present in acylphosphates. The enzyme is thought to regulate metabolic processes in which acylphosphates are involved, such as glycolysis {{and the production of}} ribonucleotides. Furthermore the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing the phospho-aspartyl intermediate formed during the action of membrane pumps such as (Ca 2 ++Mg 2 +) ATPase. Although the tertiary structure of a muscle ACP has been determined by NMR spectroscopy, {{little is known about the}} catalytic mechanism of ACP and further structures might provide an increased understanding. Results: The structure of ‘common type’ ACP from bovine testis has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1. 8 Å. The structure has been refined to an R factor of 17. 0 % using all data between 15 and 1. 8 Å. The binding of a sulphate and a chloride ion in the active centre allows a detailed description of this site. The overall protein folds of common type and muscle ACP are similar but their loops have very different conformations. These differences, in part, are probably caused by the binding of the ions in the active site of the common type form. The phosphate-binding loop of ACP shows some remarkable similarities to that of {{low molecular}} weight protein tyrosine phosphatase. Conclusions: The active site of ACP has been located, enabling a reaction mechanism to be suggested in which the phosphate moiety bound to Arg 23 acts as a base, abstracting a proton from a nucleophilic water molecule liganded to Asn 41. The <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate</b> is stabilized by the phosphate-binding loop. We suggest the catalysis to be substrate assisted, which probably explains why this enzyme can only hydrolyze acylphosphates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} (NAD+) has {{a central}} role in life processes. The ubiquitous enzyme NAD+ synthetase catalyzes a key step in NAD+ biosynthesis, transforming deamido-NAD+ into NAD+ by a two-step reaction. NAD+ synthetase belongs to the amidotransferase family and has been recognized {{as a member of the}} family of N-type ATP pyrophosphatases. In order to investigate the mechanism of the reaction carried out by NAD+ synthetase we have determined a high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the Bacillus subtilis homodimeric NAD+ synthetase in complex with the trapped reaction intermediate NAD-adenylate. Results: Two NAD-adenylate molecules and two pyrophosphate (PPi) molecules are observed in the 1. 3 å resolution structure of the NAD+ synthetase–NAD-adenylate complex. Structural studies on the NAD+ synthetase–NAD-adenylate adduct and on the cation-binding sites reveal a new deamido-NAD+-binding site located at the subunit interface, locate a binuclear magnesium cluster at the ATP-binding site and, identify two monovalent cation sites, one of which may represent an ammonium-binding site. Conclusions: Our results suggest that two different catalytic strategies have been adopted by NAD+ synthetase in the two different steps of the reaction. During the adenylation step, no protein residues seem to be located properly to directly participate in catalysis, which is likely to be carried out with the fundamental assistance of an electron-withdrawing trimetallic constellation present in the active site. A different behavior is observed for the second step, in which an ammonium ion is the binding species. In this step, Asp 173 is a key residue in both deprotonation of the primarily bound ammonium ion, and stabilization of the tetrahedral <b>transition-state</b> <b>intermediate.</b> Moreover, the structural data suggest that product release can take place only after all substrates are bound to the enzyme, and product release is ultimately controlled by the conformation adopted by two mobile loops...|$|E
