40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} how the role of {{transactional}} lawyers and their relationships with artists {{in the music industry}} first developed and then have adapted to changes in the industry to stay relevant.

Therefore, the role of what a transactional entertainment lawyer needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful <b>has</b> shifted.

The analysis will help get a better understanding of the business and will help plan and make the objectives more solid because it shows the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats the business is facing. This helps decide where the business is today, and where it will be in the future.Planning is a continuous process of research and analysis, task analysis, execution, and assessment.

About the series Soule said, [...] "Obviously, the idea of Superman and Wonder Woman being romantic with each other is not brand new. That concept {{has been around for a}} long time. It was addressed in Kingdom Come, the great Mark Waid book. Most recently, in Justice League #12 (October 2012), they had the kiss heard 'round the world... They're arguably two of the most powerful beings in the whole DC Universe and they're romantic together so just imagine the adventures and excitement that can come from that." [...] Regarding the dynamic of the characters Soule said, [...] "Frankly, these are people that have a lot in common. There are maybe 100 people on the planet that can fly, and two of them are Wonder Woman and Superman. At the same time, they grew up in very, very different cultures and situations. They have extraordinarily different backgrounds and there is a lot that they have to learn about each other too." [...] Soule continued, [...] "One of things that I would like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>have</b> the way they approach battles grow over time as they get to know each other better so that fights become more coordinated. Wonder Woman has the background as a warrior dating back to when she was very little. Ares, in the New 52, was her warrior teacher when she was 12.
