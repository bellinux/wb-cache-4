Early Cowles Commission work on simultaneous equations estimation centered on Koopman and Hood's (1953) algorithms from the economics of transportation and optimal routing, with maximum likelihood estimation, and closed form algebraic calculations, as iterative solution search techniques were limited {{in the days before}} computers. Anderson and Rubin (1949, 1950) developed the limited information maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters of a single structural equation, which indirectly included the <b>two-stage</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> estimator and its asymptotic distribution (Anderson, 2005) and Farebrother (1999). <b>Two-stage</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> was originally proposed as a method of estimating the parameters of a single structural equation in a system of linear simultaneous equations, being introduced by Theil (1953a, 1953b, 1961) and more or less independently by Basmann (1957) and Sargan (1958). Anderson's limited information maximum likelihood estimation was eventually implemented in a computer search algorithm, where it competed with other iterative SEM algorithms. Of these, <b>two-stage</b> <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> was by far the most widely used method in the 1960s and the early 1970s.|$|E

The results of the paper indicate that off-balance sheet activities tend to reduce bank efficiency.
