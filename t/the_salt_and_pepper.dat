It was a desperate case, and it was {{comparatively}} early days with him then, and he worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost {{be said to have}} made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put in all <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper.</b> The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy. The murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of years--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure," [...] said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve, [...] "that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then, though he sometimes does now." ...|$|E
6000|$|But by {{the time}} that they had gone a mile, when their feet had left the road and were {{pressing}} the grassy field-path, there was no longer any hypocrisy in her happiness. Madeline believed that no human being could talk as did her father, and on this occasion he came out with his freshest thoughts and his brightest wit. Nor did he, by any means, have the talk all to himself. The delight of Judge Staveley's conversation consisted chiefly in that--that though he might bring on to the carpet all the wit and all the information going, he rarely uttered much beyond his own share of words. And now they talked of pictures and politics--of the new gallery that was not to be built at Charing Cross, and the great onslaught which was not to end in the dismissal of Ministers. And then they got to books--to novels, new poetry, magazines, essays, and reviews; and with the slightest touch of pleasant sarcasm the judge passed sentence on the latest efforts of his literary contemporaries. And thus at last they settled down on a certain paper which had lately appeared in a certain Quarterly--a paper on a grave subject, which had been much discussed--and the judge on a sudden stayed his hand, and spared his raillery. [...] "You have not heard, I suppose, who wrote that?" [...] said he. No; Madeline had not heard. She would much like to know. When young people begin their world of reading there is nothing so pleasant to them as knowing the little secrets of literature; who wrote this and that, of which folk are then talking;--who manages this periodical, and puts <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> into those reviews. The judge always knew these events of the inner literary world, and would communicate them freely to Madeline as they walked. No; there was no longer the slightest touch of hypocrisy in her pleasant manner and eager voice as she answered, [...] "No, papa, I have not heard. Was it Mr. So-and-so?" [...] and she named an ephemeral literary giant of the day. [...] "No," [...] said the judge, [...] "it was not So-and-so; but yet you might guess, as you know the gentleman." [...] Then the slight shade of hypocrisy came upon her again in a moment. [...] "She couldn't guess," [...] she said; [...] "she didn't know." [...] But as she thus spoke the tone of her voice was altered. [...] "That article," [...] said the judge, [...] "was written by Felix Graham. It is uncommonly clever, and yet there are a great many people who abuse it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Alternatively, {{the coat}} can be {{regularly}} clipped with shears. Clipping {{as opposed to}} stripping results {{in a loss of}} the wiry texture and some of the fullness of the coat. Dogs with clipped fur no longer ‘blow’ their coat but the coat loses its wiry texture and becomes soft. The fur of clipped dogs tends to be more prone to tangling and knots, particularly when long, and is duller in color than that of stripped coats. In the case of <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> Schnauzers, the characteristic banded color of the hair is completely lost when maintained through clipping; each shaft of hair becomes entirely gray rather than being banded with multiple shades of gray, white, and black.|$|E

She spent short periods in apartments rented on her behalf by a decreasing number of friends and supporters, many of whom attempted to assist her in writing an autobiography. They hoped it might be successful enough to support her. In a reminiscent sketch, Zelda Fitzgerald wrote how she and F.

5000|$|Schnauzers have {{distinctive}} beards and long, feathery eyebrows. They {{are generally}} either a {{salt and pepper}} color, black, or white, {{but they can be}} brown also. Some owners shave their Schnauzers down the back while the hairs on their legs are kept long and curly, but this changes the coat colour, so show schnauzers especially will have their back coat [...] "stripped" [...] by hand, to encourage <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> pattern to emerge. It was traditional to have the tails docked and the ears cropped to give an alert appearance. It was common to crop the ears and dock the tails on working dogs. As these are ratters, these procedures don't give the rat anything to grab on to when being attacked and therefore cannot fight back. Cropping and docking are now illegal in the European Union, Australia and New Zealand, and are becoming less common elsewhere. The schnauzer's beard and leg hair should be brushed often to prevent mats from forming.|$|E
50|$|Returning {{items from}} the trash to the home, {{releasing}} mice or poisonous snakes (especially those whose poison works on contact and need not be injected) in walls or basements and alluding to topics referenced in tapped phone conversations is also popular, as is filling both <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> shakers with 'pepper'; (in a controlled or export economy, as in times of economic hardship generally, ersatz pepper is typically made of sawdust-type substitutes such as bark or for example 'winter pepper'; see especially 'witzpulver' but also 'monk's pepper'). Usually, victims {{had no idea that}} the Stasi were responsible and indeed, it is probable that they not always were. Many thought that they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result. The 'dissolution' is likely at least occasionally intended to carry the same connotation as in such uses as 'dissolution of marriage,' 'breakdown of the traditional family unit,' etc. It should perhaps be noted further that no one had a monopoly on monitoring communications, whether in East Germany or anywhere else.|$|E
50|$|In <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise (sparse {{light and}} dark disturbances), pixels in the image are very {{different}} in color or intensity from their surrounding pixels; the defining characteristic is {{that the value of}} a noisy pixel bears no relation to the color of surrounding pixels.
