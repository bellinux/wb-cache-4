5|$|The {{most common}} {{electrode}} holder is a semiautomatic air-cooled holder. Compressed air circulates {{through it to}} maintain moderate temperatures. It is used with lower current levels for welding lap or butt joints. The second {{most common type of}} electrode holder is semiautomatic water-cooled, where <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> water takes the place of air. It uses higher current levels for welding T or corner joints. The third typical holder type is a water cooled automatic electrode holder—which is typically used with automated equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{definitions}} and notations used for Tait-Bryan angles {{are similar to}} those described above for proper Euler angles (geometrical definition, intrinsic rotation definition, extrinsic rotation definition). <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Tait–Bryan angles represent rotations about three distinct axes (e.g. x-y-z, or x-y’-z″), while proper Euler angles use the same axis for both the first and third elemental rotations (e.g., z-x-z, or z-x’-z″).|$|E
25|$|Articulated SLC Type – This is a {{slightly}} less-stylish {{variation of the}} articulated tram, also manufactured at Nonapukur. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> its front and back are overhanging, and narrow towards the ends. It also had an improved engine, but was suitable for local routes. Later, this type was also used on express routes. Some early cars were also well-maintained.|$|E

25|$|Types Ia, IIa, and IIIa {{have the}} same {{composition}} as types I, II, and III. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in Ia, IIa, and IIIa, an air-entraining agent is ground into the mix. The air-entrainment must meet the minimum and maximum optional specification found in the ASTM manual. These types are only available in the eastern United States and Canada, only on a limited basis. They are a poor approach to air-entrainment which improves resistance to freezing under low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} painting of Satavahana period that has survived at Ajanta is the Chhadanta Jataka in Cave No.10, but that too is {{in a few}} fragments. It is a painting of an elephant named Bodhisattva with six tusks. Also a mythological story is related with. The human figures {{both male and female}} are typically Satavahanas, almost identical with their counterparts on Sanchi Gateways so far as their physiognomy, the costume and jewellery are concerned. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Sanchi figures have shed some their weight.|$|E

He is one the villains serving Lord Vortech, and he takes over Superman's hometown, Metropolis. He is stopped by Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle, with Gandalf noting that his power is significantly decreased since {{he is not in}} his home realm, and is cleansed of the Locate Keystone. Similar to the movie, his armour crumbles up when he is defeated. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he crumbles into a cube that is teleported back to Lord Vortech's lair.|$|E

25|$|One of {{a number}} of {{different}} grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the middle and index fingers are split and come down {{on each side of the}} seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners. A slower delivery may also be achieved – less commonly – by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with the knuckles.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{comparison}} more obvious, the opera {{is set in}} a pseudo-Wild West America, with Mahagonny itself placed somewhere far from the rest of civilization. America was the land of unbridled capitalism, the frontier just as much so. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> bourgeois civility and civilization has yet to occupy the frontier, and thus there is no hiding the nature of capitalism beneath the facade of gentlemanly conduct. In Mahagonny, the characters are prostitutes, lumberjacks, criminals, and the like. Not one of them comes from the moneyed class, and yet the same system of exploitation was set up, but in a more naked manner. Instead of seducing a woman's love with power and influence, the residents of Mahagonny pay for a prostitute. But in Mahagonny, poverty is not just a condition the poor bring upon themselves, but a crime to be punished. Thus, Brecht and Weill tried to display capitalism as the meatgrinder they believed it to be.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} said that the small figurine was the only {{preserved}} statue of Khufu. This is not quite correct. Excavations at Saqqara in 2001 and 2003 revealed a pair of terracotta statues depicting a lion goddess (possibly Bastet or Sakhmet). On her feet two figures of childlike kings are preserved. While the right figurine can be identified as king Khufu by his Horus name, the left one depicts king Pepy I of 6th dynasty, called by his birth name. It {{is obvious that the}} figurines of Pepy were added to the statue groups in later times, because they were placed separately and at a distance from the deity. This is inconsistent with a typical statue group of the Old Kingdom—normally all statue groups were built as an artistic unit. Both statue groups are worked out similarly to each other (both have the same size and scale), <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one lion goddess holds a scepter. The excavators point out that the statues were restored during the Middle Kingdom, after they were broken apart. However, it seems that the reason for a restoration lay more in an interest for the goddess, than for a royal cult around the king figures: their names were covered with gypsum.|$|E

500|$|While in {{his first}} several Doctor Who appearances, Jack {{did not have a}} set costume, Torchwood {{established}} a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as [...] "an iconic piece of sci-fi culture". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: [...] "I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just is." [...] In fact, in her essay [...] "Fashioning Masculinity and Desire", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse [...] "through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows".|$|E

500|$|Fonville noted at {{the time}} that, in his opinion, speed was more {{essential}} than beef and weight in the shot put. Speaking about his technique, Fonville said, [...] "You concentrateand then you just try to explode across the circle." [...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach looking at him, would recognize all the points of good form. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he has unusual speed and quicknessand he is the greatest competitor I've ever coached." [...] One columnist described Fonville's steady improvement from his freshman year in 1946 through his junior year in 1948 and concluded: [...] "Small as shot-putters go, Fonville is the greatest in {{the long history of}} sensational [...] heavers." ...|$|E
