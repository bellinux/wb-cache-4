Petrelis remembers feeling outrage on hearing the news of White’s sentence and said of the property destruction he had watched that night, “I remember feeling <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> — that you had to have this destruction of personal property to send a message...to gay people here in San Francisco— [...] is not okay. And we had to look out for ourselves — even with the relative liberal attitudes of San Francisco.” ...|$|E

In 2012, the term bucket list was listed in both Webster's Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
5000|$|Pete Townshend {{coined the}} phrase {{to define what}} the Who did. For some reason, it didn't stick to the Who, but it did stick to these groups {{that came out in}} the '70s that played kind of melodic songs with crunchy guitars and some wild drumming. It just kind of stuck to us like glue, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> with us because the Who were among our highest role models. We {{absolutely}} loved the Who.|$|E

5000|$|On April 15, 2015, Anno {{spoke about}} his {{feelings}} regarding Asuka and Rei. He claimed:"The truth is, I have no emotional attachment to Rei at all. In {{the midst of}} making Eva, I suddenly realized that I had forgotten her. Her very existence. For example, in episode seven, I remembered and added one shot with Rei. I had no attachment to her at all. I think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay,</b> because in episode eight, she didn't appear. Not even in a single shot." ...|$|E
5000|$|Frank Zappa paid this tribute: [...] "Tom Wilson {{was a great}} guy. He had vision, you know? And {{he really}} stood by us ... I {{remember}} {{the first thing that}} we recorded was 'Any Way the Wind Blows,' and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay.</b> Then we did 'Who Are the Brain Police?' and I saw him through the glass and he was on the phone immediately to New York going, 'I don't know!' Trying to break it to 'em easy, I guess.""Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mark Harmon {{commented on}} the choice to rewrite Gibbs' backstory in the third season, saying, [...] "I kid about it, but {{for a number of}} years here, I was playing that Gibbs was married three times, and then all of a sudden I found out that he’d been married four. I mean, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay,</b> so you adjust. But I think one of the nice things they do here is {{challenge}} the characters. Because a lot of times, individually and as a group, we'll pick up a script and realize that we have read something that we didn't know. It's highly probable that I don't know all the secrets of this character, and that makes him fun to play." ...|$|E
5000|$|After meeting Jac Holzman, who had {{recently}} set up Elektra Records, she recorded four 10-inch LPs for the label in 1953 and 1954. The cover sleeves were designed by Maurice Sendak, and the albums helped establish Elektra {{as a source of}} folk and world music and allowed Holzman to expand into new business premises. [...] Holzman later said:"I met Cynthia Gooding and her husband at one of those folk parties in Greenwich Village, which I sometimes describe as one of those places where {{there were a lot of}} wing chairs, candles, bullfight posters, and cheap wine. People would pass the guitar around, and it got passed to her. I was pretty impressed... She was one of the earliest artists I recorded. I remember being leery of someone not indigenous to those cultures singing those songs. I certainly knew the Moorish-Spanish connection, but I was unsure about her accent. I went to a couple of people and they said 'she's pure Castilian,' so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> with me. She did everything well. It was fun recording with her." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1939, Coghlan {{starred in}} Blazing Barriers, {{one of the}} last roles in which he was billed as Junior Coghlan. He played a young hoodlum from the city who hides out at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the mountains. A {{newspaper}} story described the physical challenges that faced Coghlan in the role: [...] "If you think being a screen star is a lot of fun, just ask Frank 'Junior' Coghlan." [...] For two days, Coghlan had to pick up Milburn Stone, an actor 50 pounds heavier than Coghlan, and run about 200 yards. In another scene, Coghlan had to jump into a creek and rescue Edward Arnold, Jr. Although both could swim, director Aubrey Scotto wanted realism, and each time Coghlan would try to save the 195 lb Arnold, [...] "both would sink and come up sputtering for breath." [...] In a third scene, Coghlan went into the boxing ring with another actor. The newspaper article noted: Inasmuch as he doesn't use a double, Coghlan had to insert more realism. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> as he is very adept with his fists. Unfortunately the sequence called for Coghlan to take a severe beating. He did.|$|E

5000|$|However, Alf's {{enjoyment}} {{of working in}} the Post Office resurfaces. In the lead up to Renee's exit, she agrees to move to Grange-Over-Sands to run their village Post Office for a [...] "new start". In the book Fifty Years of Coronation Street, author Tim Randall notes that Renee and Alf had become [...] "full of plans" [...] in their need to [...] "enjoy the country life to the full". To prepare for the move Renee decides to take driving lessons so they can fully experience the countryside. Alf takes the role of her driving instructor and during one lesson they decide to take a detour for lunch. On the way home Renee stalls at a set of traffic lights, so Alf exits the car to take the wheel. But as he does a truck makes a [...] "head-on collision" [...] with the vehicle. Hindle did not require a stunt double to film her final scenes. Artificial blood was applied to her face and arms. She told a reporter from Inside Soap that [...] "the first shot is me going towards the windscreen and then they cut before I got there. Once they decided <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay,</b> they reversed the shot, broke the glass and stuck my head through it, and then I {{came back from the}} windscreen onto the seat." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film {{opens to}} the actual murder. Three teenage boys are holding a knife to the throat of a man. They are {{demanding}} his wedding ring, and he is begging for his life. The boy holding the knife says [...] "he can't do it." [...] Another boy draws a pistol, says [...] "God Forgive me", and shoots him to death. The three boys {{run out of the}} house to a getaway car. The scene then cuts to a courtroom. The prosecuting attorney explains to the court that Ms. Smart coerced the boys into the murder of her husband. The scene then cuts to a flashback, where Gregg Smart calls the home of his then-fiancee Pam. He tells her that he got a job at a New Hampshire insurance company, and that she should pack her bags. When he arrives, she notices that he has had his hair cut, and expresses her disapproval. The next scene shows their wedding. As they are about to drive off, she tells her new parents-in-law that she is thankful that they have been so good to her. Pamela soon applies for a job at a news station, but is turned down. She then gets a job as a media director at a high school, where she begins an Anti-Drug campaign. For the drug campaign, she meets several students, including Billy Flynn and Cecelia Pierce. After the meeting, she drives Cecelia and Billy home, dropping off Cecelia first. When Billy and Pam are alone in the car, they learn of their shared fandom of Van Halen, and Pam says she used to work on a radio station, & met the band then. Later on, Billy, Pam, and Cecelia learn of a contest to make an advertisement for orange juice, which has a cash prize and a trip to Florida. They decide to make a music video for it, Billy being the cameraman. Soon after, Cecelia expresses her interest of going into a similar field to Pam, who offers to let her be her intern. Cecelia accepts, and tells Pam that Billy has a [...] "major crush" [...] on her. On one occasion, Pam and Billy go to a nightclub together, despite Billy's mother's disapproval. One day of filming the music video, Pam asks Billy if she could shower at his house, he says <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay.</b> Afterward, Billy and Pam talk in his bedroom, & they soon begin to kiss each other passionately. Pam soon pulls away and tells Billy that she's married. However, soon Billy is at his friend's house. He tells his friend that his mom believes he is sleeping over there, so if she calls he should pretend he can't come to the phone, but in reality he is going to Pam's and that her husband is out of town. When asked if they plan to have sex, Billy says [...] "I hope so." [...] At Pam's, they do end up going upstairs and having sex for the first time. When Pam is driving Billy home one day, she tells him they have to break up. Billy asks her why, and she says that Gregg rarely goes out of town like that, and that she wants to be with Billy always. She tells him that the only way they could be together is if he murders her husband. Billy suggests that she divorce Gregg, but she says that all they own is made out to him, and he would get all of it. He also has had a history of beating her, and is afraid for her safety if she leaves him. She tells him that he will also pay his friends $1,000 to kill her husband. On two separate occasions, Billy says he and his friends will kill Gregg, but both times he doesn't, and Pam reacts with anger, and threatens to tell Gregg of the whole situation. Billy tells his friends that he would commit suicide if he lost Pam. On the third occasion, they succeed in killing him. When questioned by the police and media, Pam adamantly claims that her husband was not a violent person, nor was he involved with illegal drugs. Meanwhile, an anonymous caller tells the Police that Cecelia knew about the plot. The police immediately question Cecelia, who eventually admits to the story being true. Billy & his friends are arrested, as is Pam. Billy is offered a reduced sentence if he testifies against Pam, and his friends talk him into it. The movie ends in the courtroom again. The jury finds Pamela to be guilty, and she is {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole and Billy is sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 28 years.|$|E
40|$|In 1999, I {{wanted to}} make a video based on my book, The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women. I liked the idea of making a how-to video, but while most of the {{instructional}} videos I 2 ̆ 7 d seen were informative, they were, well, pretty boring. I {{wanted to make}} an educational anal sex video that not only taught viewers how to have safe and pleasurable anal sex, but also inspired them to do it because what they were watching was sexy and hot. Instead of discussing and demonstrating tips and techniques in a clinical way, I wanted to show heat and excitement, but I knew that as soon as I included explicit, hardcore sex, I was in the land of pornography. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay,</b> though. My first exposure to porn was seeing feminist porn like On Our Backs, Debi Sundahl 2 ̆ 7 s How to Female Ejaculate, and videos from Fatale Video. I knew pornography had the potential to be feminist. I want porn to be more sex-positive, and I want more sex-positive porn. There is one great force which could stop me and others from making a different kind of porn: the government.
