5|$|Weyland is <b>the</b> <b>billionaire</b> {{founder and}} CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive ego and suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and an hour to remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. <b>The</b> <b>billionaire</b> learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

[...] Happy to have grass-roots support, the Forbes handlers (who believed <b>the</b> <b>Billionaires</b> were {{students from a}} nearby business school) placed {{them in front of}} the cameras, very near to the podium from which Forbes was speaking. However, each of their signs had another sign behind it. And behind their banner (which read [...] "Forbes 2000: He wants YOU to win") was another banner, waiting. At the most dramatic moment of his announcement, <b>the</b> <b>Billionaires</b> flipped their signs, and pulled away the large banner to reveal one which read: [...] "Billionaires for Forbes: Because Inequality isn't Growing Fast Enough." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Billionaires</b> started chanting [...] "Let workers pay the tax so investors can relax!" [...] and other slogans. Forbes and his handlers were completely thrown off, a little tussle ensued, and <b>the</b> <b>Billionaires</b> were pushed off to the side away from the cameras. Not wanting to miss the action, half the TV crews left the Forbes speech to cover <b>the</b> <b>Billionaires.</b> <b>The</b> action got lots of coverage.|$|R

25|$|In 2016 Daniel stated on Twitter that he {{was going}} to get drunk and write an erotic novel {{starring}} Donald Trump.

25|$|His work {{continued}} to be derided by the critics up to and {{after his death in}} 1910, but he won a following among his contemporaries: Picasso, Matisse, and Toulouse-Lautrec were all admirers of his work. Around 1908, the art dealer Ambroise Vollard purchased Surprised! and two other works from Rousseau, who had offered them at a rate considerably higher than the 190 francs he finally received. The painting was later purchased by the National Gallery, London in 1972 with a contribution from <b>the</b> <b>billionaire</b> philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} Ark overlap {{with those of}} Flood: in {{preparation}} for a flood that will completely submerge the Earth's continents by 2052, <b>the</b> <b>billionaire</b> Nathan Lammockson builds Ark Three, a gigantic ship that will sail the waters of the drowned Earth. Skeptical of the project's viability, the U.S. government recruits billionaires Edward Kenzie, Patrick Groundwater and Jerzy Glemp to fund the construction of Ark One (later renamed Project Nimrod), a generation ship capable of superluminal travel using an Alcubierre warp drive. The plan is to fly Ark One to an Earth-like exoplanet and rebuild civilisation on the new world. The nature of Ark Two is top secret.|$|E
25|$|Hughes' $2.5billion {{estate was}} {{eventually}} split in 1983 among 22 cousins, including William Lummis, {{who serves as}} a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Hughes Aircraft was owned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute which sold it to General Motors in 1985 for $5.2billion. The court rejected suits by the states of California and Texas that claimed they were owed inheritance tax. In 1984 Hughes' estate paid an undisclosed amount to Terry Moore, who claimed she and Hughes had secretly married on a yacht in international waters off Mexico in 1949 and never divorced. Moore never produced proof of a marriage, but her book, The Beauty and <b>the</b> <b>Billionaire,</b> became a bestseller.|$|E

Annenberg Ames felt unable to wear the diamond in her native New York City, and decided to sell the stone. She later said that [...] "I found myself positively cringing and keeping my gloves on for fear it would be seen.... It sat in a bank vault for years. It seemed foolish to keep it if one could not use it. As things are in New York one could not possibly wear it publicly".|$|E

By the time the Vogler episodes began to air, the show had become a hit and the character was soon dropped. Shore said {{the concept of a}} villainous boss was not really viable for the series: [...] "It's called House. The audience knows he'll never get fired." ...|$|E
