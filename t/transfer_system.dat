25|$|The <b>Transfer</b> <b>System</b> on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the <b>Transfer</b> <b>system</b> if you win your first moto.|$|E

25|$|Greg Hill still {{refused to}} race ABA races because he {{allegedly}} hated the ABA's direct <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> {{in which the}} winner of the first moto would then sit out and not race the second and third cycle of motos until the Main, or if the race is big enough, the semis, quarter semis, etc. He and many other racers preferred the NBL's Olympic or cumulative system in which the qualifying rounds would be run three times and the average place in each round would be added and the four lowest numbers would advance to the main. This system put a premium on consistency while the <b>Transfer</b> <b>System</b> was a little closer to luck, both good and bad for a racer. The ABA used a similar system during its controversial 1982 and 1983 Grand Nationals to choose its number one title to minimize anyone lucking into or out of the title. Also, points are awarded in the motos in the Cumulative System as well as the main so the racer doesn't walk away with nothing if he doesn't advance. Hill's objections seem odd considering he would race in the future sanctioning body the United States Bicycle Association (USBA) which used the <b>transfer</b> <b>system.</b> The USBA did offer larger, more consistent pro purses than the ABA generally.|$|E

25|$|Among the Pros the Cumulative {{method is}} preferred. Not {{only because they}} get to race more, it lessens the chance of luck playing {{as a factor in}} any given race event. In 1985 Greg Hill staged a {{personal}} boycott of ABA nationals in part of his dislike of the <b>transfer</b> <b>system.</b> Cumulative scoring is not only used in the ABA and NBL pro qualifying motos but in the mains, in which the pros are required to race the mains three times to win points and prize money. Cumulative scoring, also known as Olympic scoring, is used by the UCI in their international BMX program and was used in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China for both amateurs and professionals. The ABA continues to use the <b>Transfer</b> <b>System</b> for its amateur classes.|$|E

25|$|In {{a typical}} day a racer will race several times with their group to {{determine}} the day's finishing order and awards. The qualifying rounds, called Motos (called heats in other types of racing) determines the number of racers in the finals which are called Mains, up to eight racers. The sizes and number of motos at a skill level and age group {{is determined by the}} number of racers who register for that race and in that skill level and age group. Usually a racer gets three chances to qualify. As stated in the previous section, the two sanctioning bodies generally use two different methods of moving racers from the qualifying rounds to the Main (although there is some overlap), the <b>Transfer</b> <b>System,</b> the method generally used by the ABA; and the Moto System, the NBL's choice. In the <b>transfer</b> <b>system</b> usually one to three people are transferred to the main {{depending on the size of}} the class.|$|E
