50|$|Though many spells from <b>the</b> <b>predeceasing</b> texts {{were carried}} over, the new coffin texts also had {{additional}} new spells added, along with slight changes made {{to make this}} new funerary text more relatable to the nobility. In the First Intermediate Period, however, {{the importance of the}} pharaoh declined. Funerary texts, previously restricted to royal use, became more widely available. The pharaoh was no longer a god-king in the sense that only he was allowed in the next life due to his status here, now he was merely the ruler of the population who upon his death would be leveled down towards the plane of the mortals.|$|E
50|$|Redmarshall {{is home to}} St Cuthbert Church, names so in honour of St. Cuthbert an Anglo-Saxon monk and bishop. St Cuthbert is one of six churches, {{that come}} {{together}} to form the Stockton Deanery in the diocese of Durham. The churches are all of Anglican descent and form the local parish. St Cuthbert is a Grade one listed building built in the late twelfth century. The current Church building is situated on the same site as <b>the</b> <b>predeceasing</b> Saxon church, which is notable for St Cuthbert's body having rested here on its long wandering journey before finally being laid to rest at Durham Cathedral. The building is made largely of local stone. An escape tunnel ran from Redmarshall church to Castle Hill at Bishopton also contracted in the twelfth century. The Church Fete is a long running Village tradition {{that used to be}} held in the grounds of local houses and also the village pub, the Ship, however resent years it has been held on the village green. The Fete is held yearly and is in aid of ST Cuthbert's Church. For the previous four years the event has been held on the village green in Redmarshall, on the last Sunday in August as 2pm. There will be a tombola, raffle, stalls, games and afternoon teas. In 2012 the date will be 26 August.|$|E
50|$|In {{estate and}} trust law, it is a {{provision}} in a will or trust that prevents the vesting of a gift or bequest until something occurs or fails to occur, e.g. the attainment {{of a certain age}} or <b>the</b> <b>predecease</b> of another person.|$|R
50|$|At common law, lapse {{occurs when}} the {{beneficiary}} or the devisee under <b>the</b> will <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator, invalidating the gift. The gift would instead revert to the residuary estate or be granted under the law of intestate succession.|$|R
50|$|Contingent {{beneficiary}}: If <b>the</b> primary beneficiary <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> IRA owner, {{the contingent}} beneficiary becomes the designated beneficiary. If a contingent beneficiary is not named, the default {{provision in the}} custodian-agreement applies.|$|R
5000|$|Adopted children, {{for whom}} {{adoption}} statutes create {{the same rights}} of heirship as children of the body, come {{within the meaning of}} the term [...] "lineal descendants," [...] as used in a statute providing for the non-lapse of a devise where <b>the</b> devisee <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator but leaves lineal descendants.|$|R
50|$|The {{transfer}} of rights (and occasionally also responsibilities) {{is a prerequisite}} for succession. There must be somebody on whom the rights (or responsibilities) can devolve. Where a beneficiary has already died (is predeceased) when the bequeathed benefit vests, there can be no succession except if the deceased made provision in his or her will or antenuptial contract for <b>the</b> <b>predecease</b> of <b>the</b> beneficiary or in circumstances where ex lege substitution applies.|$|R
50|$|The {{respondent}} and {{his wife}} had executed a joint will, under which it was provided that, in the event of <b>the</b> wife's <b>predeceasing</b> <b>the</b> respondent, he was to be the sole and universal heir of the deceased and the wife's estate. The executor in the estate of the deceased applied for an order declaring that the respondent was unworthy to inherit from his late wife and late children.|$|R
50|$|This {{is both a}} fideicommissary and {{a direct}} {{substitution}} in respect of the same persons. For example, the testator leaves “my farm to A, and on his death it {{is to go to}} B; if A dies before me it is to go to B.” The object of this double substitution which was in use in former times was to ensure that B would succeed if the fideicommissum collapsed owing to <b>the</b> fiduciary <b>predeceasing</b> <b>the</b> testator. Today the double substitution is superfluous.|$|R
50|$|Blanch died {{of cancer}} at a hospice in Banbury, Oxfordshire {{at the age of}} 76, and was buried in Shenington churchyard. He was survived by his wife, son, and three of the four daughters, <b>the</b> eldest <b>predeceasing</b> him.|$|R
500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under {{a secret}} trust <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator, {{his or her}} personal representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part {{of his or her}} residuary estate by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate secret trust that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a secret trust <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator, or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the testator, the position of the secret trust in unclear. In the case of a half-secret trust, the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee". Of a fully secret trust, it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a personal obligation as thus fails if renounced or if <b>the</b> trustee <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator.|$|R
50|$|Lord Stafford fought {{under his}} {{father-in-law}} {{in support of}} the House of Lancaster during the First Battle of St Albans. He appears to have been badly wounded at this battle, but either eventually died of his wounds or from <b>the</b> plague, <b>predeceasing</b> his own father in 1458.|$|R
40|$|Although {{less common}} {{than a half}} century ago, 1 {{it is not at}} all unusual to see use made of legal life estates and {{remainders}}, not to mention life estates and remainders in trust. A major concern is what is the income tax basis for a remainder and what happens if the holder of <b>the</b> life estate <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> remainder interest holder? Is the holder of the remainder interest entitled to receive a new income tax basis at death...|$|R
5000|$|For example, the {{testator}} leaves “my farm to X and if X dies {{after me}} without children, it shall go to Y, but if X dies leaving children it shall go to X’s children.” A fideicommissum {{of the farm}} is constituted, X being the fiduciary and the fideicommissary either X’s children or Y, the latter being directly substituted for {{the children in the}} event of X dying without leaving children. A similar disposition is effected where the testator leaves his farm “to my son A and on A’s death after me to A’s eldest son; if A has no son then alive, to A’s eldest daughter.” A simple form of disposition, with the same effect, is where the testator institutes “my wife sole heir and after her decease our children, and in case of <b>the</b> <b>predecease</b> of any child his lawful descendants.” ...|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{testator}} leaves “my farm to my son, {{subject to}} a life usufruct to my mother, and on her death a life usufruct to my wife.” On the testator’s death, the ownership of the farm vests in the son, if he is then alive, and the usufruct vests in the mother, if she is then alive. The wife, however, acquires no vested interest, for her right is conditional on her surviving the mother. The wife’s usufruct vests only if and when she is alive {{at the time of}} the mother’s death. If <b>the</b> mother <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator, but the wife is alive at his death, then of course the usufruct vests in the latter.|$|R
50|$|Most U.S. {{states now}} {{recognize}} {{the validity of}} Totten trusts. The Restatement 3d of Trusts (Section 26) and the Restatement 3d of Property (Section 7.1 comment i) also recognize its validity. Such a device can be revoked at any time by the settlor, either by closing the account or by executing a will which disposes of the property in the account. The funds in the account {{can be reached by}} the creditors of the settlor during the settlor's life. If <b>the</b> intended beneficiary <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> settlor, then the gift will lapse, and will generally not be saved by an anti-lapse statute.|$|R
50|$|His brother, Ashley George Ponsonby, {{was allowed}} by a Warrant of Precedence from the Queen {{to use the}} style of Honourable, because his father would have held the peerage but for his <b>predeceasing</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} holder.|$|R
50|$|The will may {{identify}} the taker of the residuary estate through a residuary clause or residuary bequest. The person identified {{in such a}} clause is called the residuary taker, residuary beneficiary, or residuary legatee. Such a clause may state that, in the event all other heirs <b>predecease</b> <b>the</b> testator, the estate would pass to a charity (that would, presumably, have remained in existence).|$|R
50|$|Thomas Archer II was {{the only}} son of Thomas Archer I. He died of scarlet fever in 1844 {{at the age of}} 27, <b>predeceasing</b> <b>the</b> rest of his family. His wife died in 1874 in a fatal {{carriage}} crash while returning from a ball in Launceston, and his father died six years after him in 1850. He left a four-year-old son.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{modification}} to {{the common}} law of lapse is {{the elimination of the}} [...] "no residue of a residue" [...] rule where multiple beneficiaries are named to inherit the residue. The modern view is that where a beneficiary was intended to inherit part of the residuary estate who <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> testator, and that beneficiary is not covered by the anti-lapse statute, then that beneficiary's inheritance will return to the residuary estate, to be inherited by the other beneficiaries to whom the residue has been willed.|$|R
50|$|William de Warrene (1256-1286) {{was killed}} at a tournament in Croydon pre-deceasing his father. His son John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey (1286-1347) {{was born in}} the year of his death. John married Joan of Bar but lived adulterously with Maud de Nereford from a village near Castle Acre in Norfolk. In 1347, the 7th Earl died, {{probably}} from the Black Death. His sons John and Thomas became Knights Hospitaller in <b>the</b> Holy Land, <b>predeceasing</b> their mother. <b>The</b> lands passed to Edward III.|$|R
50|$|A title held {{by someone}} who becomes monarch is said to merge in the Crown and ceases to exist, for the Sovereign cannot hold a dignity from himself. The Dukedom of Cornwall and of Rothesay, and the Earldom of Carrick, are special cases, which {{when not in use}} are said to lapse to the Crown: they are {{construed}} as existing, but held by no one, during such periods. These peerages are also special because they are never directly inherited. The Dukedom of Cornwall was held formerly by the eldest son of the King of England, and the Dukedom of Rothesay, the Earldom of Carrick, and certain non-peerage titles (Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland) by the eldest son of the King of Scotland. Since those titles have been united, the dukedoms and associated subsidiary titles are held by the eldest son of the monarch. In Scotland, the title Duke of Rothesay is used for life. In England and Northern Ireland, the title Duke of Cornwall is used until the heir-apparent is created Prince of Wales. At {{the same time as the}} Principality is created, the Duke is also created Earl of Chester. The earldom is a special case, because it is not hereditary, instead revesting or merging in the Crown if the Prince succeeds to <b>the</b> Crown or <b>predeceases</b> <b>the</b> monarch: thus George III was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a month after his father's death.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the death}} of his heir apparent, Ferdinando, in 1713, Cosimo {{deposited}} a bill in the Senate, Tuscany's titular legislature, [...] promulgating that if Cosimo and his new heir apparent, Gian Gastone, were to <b>predecease</b> <b>the</b> Electress, she would ascend the throne. Charles VI was furious; he replied that the Grand Duchy was an imperial fief and therefore he alone possessed the prerogative to alter the laws of succession. To complicate things further, Elisabeth Farnese, heiress of the Duchy of Parma, the second wife of Philip V of Spain, as a great-granddaughter of Margherita de' Medici, exercised a claim to Tuscany. In May 1716, Charles VI, who constantly changed his stance on the issue, told Florence that the Electress's succession was unquestioned, but added that Austria and Tuscany must soon reach an agreement regarding which royal house was to follow the Medici.|$|R

"To Jane Cunningham, {{the widow}} of the late Captain Charles Cunningham, of the 10th Madras Native Infantry, should she remain with my {{daughter}} until the marriage of the latter, I bequeath an annuity of 150 pounds per annum, chargeable on the estate, and to commence at my daughter's marriage. All my other property in moneys, investments, jewels, and chattels of all sorts, is to be divided in equal portions between my daughter, Millicent Conyers Thorndyke, and my nephew, Mark Thorndyke.

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} what impact, if any, {{the slaying}} of one beneficiary by another should have on distribution of a decedent’s property. This issue could arise {{in a variety of}} conveyances, such as intestate succession, wills, pay-on-death bank accounts, transfer-on-death securities, or life insurance proceeds. Based on equity, the Restatement (Third) of Restitution takes the position that a beneficiary may never move forward in the line of succession {{as the result of a}} slaying. This result is thought to be an extension of the traditional “slayer rule,” which disallows a slayer from inheriting from her victim. The Article argues for the opposite conclusion: {{the slaying of}} a higher-priority beneficiary by a contingent beneficiary does not result in unjust enrichment because it does not result in a transfer of a property interest to the slayer. Although the slayer advances in the line of succession as a result of the slaying, the slayer still only possesses a defeasible expectancy, not a property interest. Because an expectancy is the legal equivalent of nothing, the slayer has not profited as a result of the killing. Thus, the property distribution should be governed by the likely intent of the owner of the estate rather than by the Restatement’s misguided notion of equity. When there is no governing instrument, the best approach is to presume that the owner of the estate would neither wish to totally disinherit the slayer nor permit the slayer’s share to increase as a result of the slaying. Thus, the slayer’s distribution should be calculated as if the victim of the slaying did not <b>predecease</b> <b>the</b> owner of the estate. But when there is a governing instrument that was either republished after the slaying or went unchanged for a reasonable time after the slaying, the law should simply carry out the property distribution as directed in the instrument even if it results in a larger share for the slayer than the slayer would have received if the slayer’s victim was still alive. This result is most likely in keeping with the intent of the estate’s owner...|$|R
60|$|The {{news was}} {{imparted}} with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial {{usage of the}} Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth {{in the presence of}} the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin <b>predeceasing</b> <b>the</b> other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.|$|R
