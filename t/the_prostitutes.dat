Letters exchanged between the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Augustus Stephenson, and his assistant, Hamilton Cuffe, make coded reference to Newton's threats to implicate Albert Victor.|$|E

Raghunath visits the hospital, but finds that Chandru has left. Raghunath is joined by Ravi, and both rush to Chandru's house.|$|E
5|$|In {{a suburb}} of Bucharest, a 13-year-old boy, Andrei (Gabriel Huian), {{together}} {{with some of his}} friends, watches the prostitutes' show every night from a rooftop and how they are being taken by drivers. The boy falls in love with one of the girls, called Marilena (Mădălina Ghiţescu), and finds out that he needs a decent sum of money in order to approach her. Thus, he steals his father's (Gabriel Spahiu) salary and goes to the prostitutes' meeting place. Marilena's pimp (Andi Vasluianu) is also present, and only agrees to send Marilena and another prostitute with the boy to a nearby pub, where the Rom Elvis is singing (played by the singer Elvis Romano, who translated Elvis Presley's lyrics into his own language). <b>The</b> <b>prostitutes</b> play with Andrei, telling him that he needs a car in order to date them, then they leave. The boy asks Marilena for her phone number, and she writes something in his hand.|$|E
5000|$|With {{regard to}} prostitution, three worldviews exist: abolitionism (where <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> is {{considered}} a victim), regulation (where <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> {{is considered a}} worker) and prohibitionism (where <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> is considered a criminal). Currently all these views are represented in some Western country.|$|R
5000|$|Probably drafted around 1912, Mirbeau’s text {{is divided}} into six chapters: « The origins of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> », « <b>the</b> <b>prostitute’s</b> body », « A visit to <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> », « <b>The</b> <b>prostitute’s</b> hatred and courage », « The love of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> », and « Future of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> ». In his work, Mirbeau intends to {{rehabilitate}} prostitutes who, far from being inherently vicious and perverse women as Cesare Lombroso would maintain, were doubly victims : on the one hand, {{because of the economic}} and social conditions inflicted on women coming from disadvantaged backgrounds and, on the other hand, because of the hypocrisy of a controlling class that scorns, rejects and condemns, {{in the name of a}} spurious “morality”, the women whose services are needed as a result of the sexual frustration caused by monogamous marriages.|$|R
5000|$|The two {{developing}} {{relationships between}} Hyun-shik and <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> and Hyun-shik and Hee-jin move the plot. Hee-jin looks after Hyun-shik, even saving him from two suicide attempts, {{the second one}} accomplished gruesomely by swallowing a string of fish hooks. <b>The</b> <b>prostitute</b> continues to take {{more and more time}} off her schedule to visit Hyun-shik, oblivious to his troubles and eventually Hee-jin becomes jealous. During one visit, Hee-jin ferries <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> to an empty float instead of Hyun-shik's, ties her up and duct tapes her mouth shut, which eventually leads to her death as she falls into the water. The next morning Hee-jin finds her drowned and submerges her body tied to her motorbike. <b>The</b> <b>prostitute's</b> pimp, who comes to find out what's happening, falls in the water after a fight with Hyun-shik. Hee-jin appears in the water and kills the pimp. He is then submerged near <b>the</b> <b>prostitute.</b>|$|R
5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to <b>the</b> <b>prostitutes</b> about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
5|$|The Bengalee, a reformist newspaper, {{presents}} a rare {{view of the}} true victim Elokeshi being forgotten in the debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin. In the First Meeting painting, Elokeshi is sometimes depicted as a courtesan, indicating {{that she is the}} one who seduces the mahant. She is often described as unchaste and to have developed the adulterous affair and even lived with him for some time {{despite the fact that he}} first rapes her. In one play, Elokeshi's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes. The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman, question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent. <b>The</b> <b>prostitutes</b> empathise with Elokeshi, another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace, which for them illustrates the brittle status of a wife. Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the mahants lust on her father's command. Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives in to her father's orders than on the depiction of rape.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of <b>the</b> <b>prostitutes</b> were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian , and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the image of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> in four films: Klute (1971) Pretty Baby (1978) McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1972) and American Gigolo (1980). It {{includes}} a review of the image of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> in art and literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These earlier images are compared and contrasted with the images presented in the four films and used to analyze how women are represented through the role of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute</b> in Klute, Pretty Baby and McCabe and Mrs. Miller. American Gigolo presents male prostitution in a manner conventional to prostitution, but unconventional in terms of representing men. American Gigolo provides a contrast for the three other films in terms of both gender and the image of <b>the</b> <b>prostitute...</b>|$|R

25|$|After the {{independence}} of Pakistan in 1947, Pakistan inherited the historical red-light districts in Lahore and Multan including the infamous Hira Mandi area. These were well-developed and attracted both wealthy clients and those looking for singers and actresses. <b>The</b> <b>prostitutes</b> and associates in the sex-trade were named Kanjars. while their musician companions were known as the community of Mirasis. <b>The</b> <b>prostitutes</b> would usually, and still do, dance {{to the music of}} harmonium and tabla played by the mirasis. Where Lahore and Multan were the known contenders in the trade, other cities also had their own red-light districts which may include Ghulam abad and Aminpur bazar in Faisalabad Napier Road in Karachi and Qasai Gali in Rawalpindi. <b>The</b> <b>prostitutes</b> retained the hereditary character of their occupation and the social stigma.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the brothel did {{not serve}} black customers. In 1967, a {{separate}} trailer for blacks was built, and <b>the</b> <b>prostitutes</b> were allowed to refuse these men.

25|$|During {{the time}} of the New Comedy (of ancient Greek comedy), prostitute {{characters}} became, after the fashion of slaves, the veritable stars of the comedies. This could be for several reasons: while Old Comedy (of ancient Greek comedy) concerned itself with political subjects, New Comedy dealt with private subjects and the daily life of Athenians. Also, social conventions forbade well-born women from being seen in public; while the plays depicted outside activities. The only women who would normally be seen out in the street were logically <b>the</b> <b>prostitutes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The working {{conditions}} from these brothels {{have also been}} criticized by many. During the 1970s and early 1980s, several towns had enacted rules prohibiting local brothel prostitutes from frequenting local bars or casinos or associating with local men outside of work. After a lawsuit was filed in 1984, these regulations had to be abandoned, {{but as a result}} of collaboration between sheriffs and brothel owners, they remain in effect unofficially. For instance, most brothels do not allow <b>the</b> <b>prostitutes</b> to leave the premises during their work shifts of several days to several weeks.|$|E

25|$|The North Hamlet (the Gay Quarters); the {{homosexual}} community of Chang'an was concentrated {{here in a}} ward to the northwesternmost area of the city sector. Homosexuality in China was often called 'pleasures of the bitten peach', the 'cut sleeve', or the 'southern custom'. Along with the concentration of Chang'an's gay community here, the North Hamlet was also heavily concentrated {{with many of the}} city's entertaining courtesans, as well as its notorious brothel houses for prostitution. Aside from <b>the</b> <b>prostitutes,</b> the Chinese courtesans were more or less similar to the Japanese geisha, and unlike the bar and tavern maids they had excellent table manners, polite mode of speech and behavior, and were reserved for entertaining the elite of society.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, in {{the utopian}} worlds of the Greeks, there was often {{no place for}} prostitutes. In Aristophanes' play Assemblywomen, the heroine Praxagora {{formally}} bans them from the ideal city: Why, undoubtedly! Furthermore, I propose abolishing the whores … so that, instead of them, we may have the first-fruits of the young men. It is not meet that tricked-out slaves should rob free-born women of their pleasures. Let the courtesans be free to sleep with the slaves.(v.716–719). <b>The</b> <b>prostitutes</b> are obviously considered to be unfair competition. In a different genre, Plato, in the Republic, proscribed Corinthian prostitutes {{in the same way}} as Attican pastries, both being accused of introducing luxury and discord into the ideal city. The cynic Crates of Thebes, (cited by Diodorus Siculus, II, 55–60) during the Hellenistic period describes a utopian city where, following the example of Plato, prostitution is also banished.|$|E
