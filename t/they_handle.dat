5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback in the way that <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E

The requests are taken {{to the board of}} directors for consideration on a case-by-case basis. The {{religious organizations}} which contract with the P.R.A.Y. business office retain all responsibility for curriculum development and establishing program guidelines, and the P.R.A.Y. business office processes their orders. Thus, P.R.A.Y. has become an interfaith resource.|$|E

25|$|A Special Branch (SB) {{division}} {{exists in}} the Royal Thai Police, part of its Crime Prevention and Suppression Support Group. Aside from intelligence gathering, they provide protection to VIPs alongside the Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau (MPB) and Armed Forces Security Centre. <b>They</b> <b>handle</b> matters {{that have to do}} with citizenship, such as the renunciation of Thai nationality. Foreign nationals living in Thailand go to the Special Branch office to secure a Thai police clearance certificate. Other cases such as lèse majesté, terrorism, and anything that endangers Thai national security are also handled by the Thai SB.|$|E
25|$|Able seamen and {{ordinary}} seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision {{and keep their}} assigned areas in good order. They watch for other vessels and obstructions in the ship's path, {{as well as for}} navigational aids such as buoys and lighthouses. They also steer the ship, measure water depth in shallow water, and maintain and operate deck equipment such as lifeboats, anchors, and cargo-handling gear. On tankers, mariners designated as pumpmen hook up hoses, operate pumps, and clean tanks. When arriving at or leaving a dock, <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> the mooring lines. Seamen also perform routine maintenance chores, such as repairing lines, chipping rust, and painting and cleaning decks. On larger vessels, a boatswain — or head seaman — will supervise the work.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{duplicated}} their 52–30 {{record in}} 1995–96, but were hurt severely by {{an injury to}} Reggie Miller's eye socket in April, from which {{he was not able}} to return until Game 5 of their first-round series against the Hawks. Reggie scored 29 points in that game, but the Hawks came away with a two-point victory to put an early end to Indiana's season. This 1995–96 team did manage to go down in history as the only team to defeat the Chicago Bulls twice that year, a Bulls team which made history with a then all-time best 72–10 record. The Pacers could not withstand several key injuries in 1996–97, nor could <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> the absence of Mark Jackson, who had been traded to the Denver Nuggets before the season (though they did re-acquire Jackson at the trading deadline). The Pacers finished 39–43 and missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years, after which coach Larry Brown stepped down.|$|E

500|$|Workers {{in other}} {{industries}} {{are at risk}} for exposure as well. [...] For example, commercial availability of pesticides in stores puts retail workers at risk for exposure and illness when <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> pesticide products. The ubiquity of pesticides puts emergency responders such as fire-fighters and police officers at risk, because they are often the first responders to emergency events and may be unaware of the presence of a poisoning hazard. [...] The process of aircraft disinsection, in which pesticides are used on inbound international flights for insect and disease control, can also make flight attendants sick.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{temporary}} undivided supportive {{attention from}} another person often {{gives rise to}} strong feelings, apparently towards that person, typically of [...] "falling in love" [...] with them. This {{is similar to the}} phenomenon of transference, particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> this. [...] The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is often exacerbated by the pseudo-intimacy of co-counseling, making transference more likely and more dangerous.|$|E
2500|$|What {{they call}} [...] "Israel" [...] is no mere {{military}} state.

Half a century of systematic maiming and murdering of another people has left its deep marks {{on the faces of}} these people, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> objects, the way they greet each other, the way they look at the world. There is an endemic prevarication to this machinery, a vulgarity of character that is bone-deep and structural to the skeletal vertebrae of its culture.|$|E

[...] Employees are rated by how quickly <b>they</b> <b>handle</b> calls because in the past they had been criticized for taking too long to answer calls, causing callers to hang up. Wilkins also claims the technology is outdated, making it difficult to piece together different parts of a case from separate calls. He claimed to have plans to remedy these situations.|$|E
2500|$|In the French system, {{the word}} [...] "ambulance" [...] itself is {{reserved}} to transportation of one individual {{on a stretcher}} on medical prescription, including oral prescription in case of emergency, and the term is generally used to apply to those response vehicles operated by the local SAMU, {{as well as the}} emergency vehicles from places such as the fire service or private companies, which are both fully equipped emergency patient transport vehicles.
