5|$|By the 7th century, England {{was almost}} entirely divided into kingdoms {{ruled by the}} Anglo-Saxons, {{who had come to}} Britain two hundred years earlier.

5000|$|One {{passage that}} it is argued {{contains}} a logical improbability in Greek is Matthew 4:8. There isn't a mountain high enough to view [...] "all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth" [...] since the earth is round. The Hebrew word found in Ibn Shaprut's medieval translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek Gospel <b>of</b> Matthew in <b>the</b> appendix to The Touchstone (c.1380) uses [...] "eretz" [...] which can be translated as earth or land. By substituting the Hebrew word [...] "eretz" [...] into the passage makes it possible that [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Israel" [...] were viewed from a high mountain such as Mount Tabor in Israel. However {{the same is true}} for Greek ge which can mean land or earth depending on context. Also since [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Israel" [...] is seen as an unlikely meaning most commentators on Matthew have seen [...] "all <b>the</b> <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> earth" [...] as being either hyperbole or a vision.|$|R
5|$|However most, if not all, {{characteristics}} of the current centralized state of <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands were foreshadowed by {{the accomplishments of the}} Batavian Republic, not least the liberal 1848 Constitution.

5|$|In 1860, {{the flag}} of <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Two Sicilies was again {{modified}} to the defaced Italian tricolour with the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies coat of arms.
