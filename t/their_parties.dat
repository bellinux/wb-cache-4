5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between <b>their</b> <b>parties.</b> Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E

40|$|In two field studies, we {{examined}} whether voters overestimate support for <b>their</b> political <b>party</b> among nonvoters. In Study 1, voters estimated {{the percentage of}} votes <b>their</b> <b>party</b> would receive in an upcoming election, and this percentage increased when voters estimated the percentage of votes <b>their</b> <b>party</b> would receive if nonvoters also were to vote. In Study 2, participants overestimated support for <b>their</b> <b>party</b> even when we made them explicitly aware of current levels of this support by presenting them with poll-based forecasts of election results. Furthermore, Study 2 demonstrated that commitment {{to vote for a}} specific party predicted the degree of overestimation. Our results imply that highly committed voters are particularly likely to project support for <b>their</b> <b>party</b> onto nonvoters. Implications for the literature on social projection and social identity are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, <b>their</b> <b>parties,</b> {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E

5000|$|Those {{people who}} {{identify}} {{with a party}} tend to vote for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> candidate for various offices in high percentages. Those who consider themselves to be strong partisans, strong Democrats and strong Republicans respectively, {{tend to be the}} most faithful in voting for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> nominee for office. In the case of voting for president, since the 1970s, party identification on voting behavior has been increasing significantly. By the late 1990s, party identification on voting behavior was at the highest level of any election since the 1950s. [...] When voting in congressional elections, the trend is similar. Strong party identifiers voted overwhelmingly for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> nominee in the general election. It {{is important to note that}} each party respectively in certain elections, would have stronger voting behavior of <b>their</b> strongest <b>party</b> identifiers. For instance, in the years the Democrats dominated House and Senate elections in the 1970s and 1980s, it can be explained that <b>their</b> strong <b>party</b> identifiers were more loyal in voting for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> nominee for Congress than the Republicans were.|$|R

These songs were actually in the form of urban guarachas (not proper rumbas), which had a binary meter in contrast to the ternary meter of traditional rural genres such as tonada and zapateo. Similarly, in Cuban bufo theatre {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, the guarachas that were sung at the end of the show were referred to as rumba final despite not sharing any musical similarities with actual rumba.|$|E
