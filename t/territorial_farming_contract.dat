40|$|Society now expects {{agriculture}} {{to fulfil}} new functions to improve quality of life. This requirement has been reinforced by recent crises. The 1999 French Agricultural Framework Law (LOA) formalised agricultural multifunctionality and included payments to farmers for new practices, which satisfy both {{social and environmental}} functions, in addition to economic ones. A voluntary <b>territorial</b> <b>farm</b> <b>contract</b> (CTE) sets out the respective commitments made by farmers and government services. In Guadeloupe (French West Indies, FWI), the recognition of agricultural multifunctionality challenges the export-and production-oriented agricultural models. Our research on the innovations that resulted from the CTEs {{has shown that the}} LOA was applied to these models in order to improve existing situations, contrary to the changes that were recommended. Paradoxically, however, the tensions between the requirements set out by the LOA and the actual achievements have helped improve the rural stakeholders' representation. Such tensions should help to reconcile development with agriculture's multifunctional nature, as well as satisfy society's expectations for sustainable rural development. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{implementation}} of the CTEs (<b>Territorial</b> <b>Farm</b> <b>Contracts)</b> in French agriculture. During the left Lionel Jospin’s government, this kind of contracts was created by the 1999 Agricultural Orientation Act in order to introduce changes in both the farming policy and individual strategies of farmers. Through the CTEs, farmers and public administration built a new social contract taking into account the implications of farming activities on the environment and countryside in France. Furthermore, {{the implementation of the}} CTEs opened the social debate about agriculture to new non-agricultural players (consumers, environmentalists, local authorities, forest owners…). Unfortunately, the CTEs did not receive sufficient social and economic support and could not resist the opposition from the French corporative agrarian lobby (particularly, from FNSEA and CNJA). The centre-right government abolished them in 2003 and created the current CADs (Contracts for Sustainable Agriculture). Paradoxally, the CTEs are today recovering their relevance in the framework of the new EU Regulation on Rural Development, as some European governments consider such contracts are useful to encourage farmers to assimilate the new agricultural and rural policies...|$|R

The study’s objective is {{to gain a better}} insight of the terms and conditions of rice <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> scheme inCambodia, and determine under what conditions <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> could bring improvements to farmers’ livelihoods. This study contributes new research findings on <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> practices and farmers’ livelihood due to organic-rice <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> with a case study in Kampong Speu province,Cambodia. Rice <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> is not widespread inCambodiaat present, but is expected to expand significantly in the near future. <b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> can increase investment into agricultural and infrastructure in rural areas. <b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> can also enable farmers to access credit, inputs, technical advice and information about market condition and pricing trends. Yet, the disadvantages of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> include loss of farmer bargaining power and a potential reduction in profit margins, increased emphasis on improving production quality, land consolidation in favor of participating contract farmers, and less secure livelihoods. In this study, the <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> arrangements of Angkor Kasekam Rongroeung (AKR) Company is studied. A survey of 16 contract farmers and 20 non-contract farmers in Kampong Speu province has been undertaken to examine the AKR <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> scheme arrangements and to identify farmer’s motivations to participate in <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> and its impact on farmers’ livelihood. AKR rice <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> improves farmers’ livelihood because they get a higher income and rice yields. Higher price, good rice seed, and access to market are the main reasons for farmers to participate in AKR <b>contract</b> <b>farming.</b> However, strict requirements, heavy penalties, poor extension services, and lack of information about the contract terms and conditions reduce farmers’ long-term participation in <b>contract</b> <b>farming.</b> In addition, <b>contract</b> farmers have less bargaining power to negotiate with the company due to the absence of a farmer association. Overall, the status of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> inCambodiaclearly points to the great potential for its expansion in the future. However, for this to be realized and for the benefits to be shared fairly between companies and the farmers themselves, the study concludes that issues {{about the role of the}} government, the regulatory framework, contract enforcement, and the formation of small-scale farmer organizations must all be addressed. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> is an {{agreement}} between a farmer and a firm regarding the agricultural production. Studies have shown that <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> can influence farmers in different ways. Positive aspects of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> {{is said to be}} that farmers get access to a bigger market, a secure source of income and valuable assistance from the companies that they have entered into a contract with. Negative aspects are foremost said to be that farmers may loose control over the production and feel {{that they do not have}} their independence left.

40|$|From the farmer's perspective, <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> {{provides}} stable market access, credits, extension services, {{infrastructure and}} other benefits, but has drawbacks such as limiting {{the flexibility of}} farming and marketing. Based on a survey of rice <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> for export in Cambodia, this paper uses simple mean comparison, propensity score matching comparison, and switching regression comparison {{to assess the impact}} of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> on farmers' performance. Farmers with larger family sizes, younger and more educated household heads, less asset value, and those with farm locations closer to the highway are more likely to join the contract. The results provide evidence that <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> of non-certified organic rice has a positive impact on farmers' profitability. They also suggest that progressive farmers living near the highway tend to join the contract first, but leave <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> early, while farmers in more remote areas remain under contract. It appears that the sample former-contract farmers' profitability did not decline after leaving <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> as they further intensified their farming systems to produce for the less chemical conscious market. Thus, <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> may be involved in the process of helping subsistence farmers develop into independent commercial farmers. This study provides empirical evidence that <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> of safe food in remote areas where land is less contaminated could be an effective private-sector led poverty reduction strategy. However, since <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> in this case is not inclusive of the poorest farmers, public sector support is required to lower the transaction costs of working with them...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> in rural India {{in recent years}} has {{provoked}} a polarised and often ideological debate in the literature. The dominant, micro-economic view of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> positions it as a ‘win-win’ for rural development, benefitting both agribusiness and small farmers. Critical observers, on the other hand, emphasise the exploitative effects on rural households, viewing <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> as ‘win-lose’. The critical weakness of both these approaches, however, is a failure to ground interpretations of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> schemes in the broader agrarian contexts in which they appear. Little is known about how different households in different contexts come to engage, or not, with <b>contract</b> <b>farming,</b> and what this might mean for future livelihood pathways in spaces where <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> operates. This thesis punctures these debates through a critical exploration of potato <b>contract</b> <b>farming,</b> rural livelihoods and agrarian change in three villages in Satara district, Maharashtra. The primary research question for this study is: how is potato <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> incorporated into rural spaces in India, and {{what does this mean for}} patterns of advantage and disadvantage? In addressing this question, I make three core contributions. First, mainstream presumptions that <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> engages with a homogenous, undifferentiated livelihood landscape need to be recast. In Satara, I find that patterns of agrarian differentiation are not characterised by ongoing dynamic processes of agriculture-led differentiation into classes of capitalist farmers and rural labour, as is imagined by a classical understanding of agrarian transition. Rather, the agrarian structure in my study sites is characterised by a diverse group of ‘middle farmers’, or petty commodity producers, who often struggle to reproduce themselves through a combination of on and off-farm activities. Second, I argue that firms use <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> as an institutional solution to the procurement challenges associated with traditional agricultural markets in India. In Satara, the spread of potato <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> is symptomatic of changing governance structures in modern agricultural value chains. My third key argument is that patterns of social and economic differentiation arising from <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> must be understood as co-produced at the intersection of these existing livelihood landscapes and the dynamics of contract schemes. In Satara, this intersection results in a complex mosaic of winners and losers amongst rural households, meaning that <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> cannot be easily generalised as ‘all good’ or ‘all bad’. Importantly, I argue that potato <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> is a ‘middle farmer’ activity. However, while many middle farmers accrue some benefits, these are unevenly distributed and truncated by the powerful position of the contract firm. As a result, I argue that for most households, <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> does not represent a viable accumulation pathway. In fact, <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> is just one activity among many in a crowded livelihood landscape where accumulation through agriculture is increasingly difficult. Finally, rather than leading to dynamic patterns of accumulation from below, <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> reproduces an agrarian structure of petty commodity producers who lack access to alternative livelihood opportunities. In fact, sites of accumulation and differentiation have moved off the farm, where better-off households ignore <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> and increase their advantage through highvalue non-farm activities. This suggests that agrarian change in Satara district is intimately connected to processes of livelihood diversification and agrarian questions of labour. These findings provide an important counter-note to current hegemonic understandings of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> as a ‘win-win’ solution for rural development, emphasising the importance of situating the impacts of such schemes within the livelihood landscapes in which they operate...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of {{participation}} in agricultural value chains on the welfare of smallholders? <b>Contract</b> <b>farming,</b> wherein a processing firm delegates its production of agricultural commodities to growers, is often viewed as a means of increasing smallholder welfare in developing countries. Because the problem posed by the nonrandom participation of grower smallholders in <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> has so far not been dealt with convincingly, however, whether participation in <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> actually increases smallholder welfare is still up for debate. This paper uses an experimentally derived nonparametric measure of willingness to pay to enter <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> to control for actual participation in <b>contract</b> <b>farming.</b> Using data from Madagascar, results indicate that participation in <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> is associated with a 10 - to 16 -percent increase in income; a 15 -percent decrease in income volatility; a two-month decrease in the duration of the hungry season; and a 31 -percent increase in the likelihood of receiving a formal loan. ...|$|R
