At {{the end of}} 1890 he went to Africa, {{resulting}} in Listy z Afryki (Letters from Africa, published in <b>The</b> <b>Word</b> <b>in</b> 1891–92, then collected as a book in 1893). The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels. In 1891 his novel Without dogma (Bez Dogmatu), previously serialized in 1889–90 in The Word, was published in book form. In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Połanieckich (Children of the Soil), which was serialized in The Polish Gazette from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894.|$|E

Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
5|$|Vowel length. The {{pronunciation}} of {{long and}} short vowels depends on the syllable's position in <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>In</b> word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long vowel has about 208% {{the length of a}} short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|E
5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> <b>In</b> syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.|$|E

The Proto-Altaic root *bŭkrV, denoting pea nut and cone, through the Proto-Turkic *burčak, denoting both pea and bean is responsible for <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> several modern Altaic languages of Europe while the others are borrowings from Arabic. The origin of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> modern Caucasian languages is the Proto-Caucasian root *howł[ā], meaning both bean and lentil. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> Uralic languages are either borrowings, mostly from Slavic, or derived from their own words denoting pea...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} attestations of the term is in Old French form esterlin, in a charter of the abbey of Les Préaux, dating to either 1085 or 1104. The English chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – c. 1142) uses the Latin forms libræ sterilensium and libræ sterilensis monetæ. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> origin refers to the newly introduced Norman silver penny.|$|E
