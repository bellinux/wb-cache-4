5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aztec</b> high priest, Tezozomoc, {{tells the}} people that they will not have the favour of their gods unless they kill the foreigners. Two warriors {{volunteer}} to capture a child to please their gods, and they return with Madoc and the child Hoel. Madoc is forced to fight other condemned men, until Madoc's Welsh allies attack the city, allowing a woman, Coatel, to free Madoc and Hoel. At the same time <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> warrior Amalahta attacks Caermadoc, but is defeated by the Welsh women. When Madoc returns, he joins the Welsh and Hoamen forces, and the battle continues until Madoc kills <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> king, Coanocotzin.|$|E
5|$|Unwilling {{to allow}} the Aztecs to {{continue}} their practices, Madoc instigates war between the Aztecs and the much smaller Hoamen nation. While the Aztecs bring a large army, Madoc is able to use Welsh technology and superior tactics to overcome them. The Hoamen are able to take many prisoners while <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> king contracts a mortal illness. Following the battle Madoc shocks the Aztecs by releasing the prisoners instead of sacrificing them, and provides leeches to help <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> king recover from his disease. This leads to a treaty between the Aztecs and the Hoamen which abolishes human sacrifice. <b>The</b> <b>Aztec</b> priests fear to stop the practice, so <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> king decides that his people will abandon their religion and take up a monotheistic religion based on a God of love.|$|E

5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} of indigenous peoples, including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an unidentified group referred to as the Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News of strangers first arrived in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E
5|$|In the {{run up to}} the {{announcement}} that an invasion force was {{to be sent to}} Guatemala, 10,000 Nahua warriors had already been assembled by <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> emperor Cuauhtémoc to accompany the Spanish expedition. Warriors were ordered to be gathered from each of the Mexica and Tlaxcaltec towns. The native warriors supplied their own weapons, including swords, clubs and bows and arrows. Alvarado's army left Tenochtitlan {{at the beginning of the}} dry season, sometime between the second half of November and December 1523. As Alvarado left <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> capital, he led about 400 Spanish and approximately 200 Tlaxcaltec and Cholultec warriors and 100 Mexica, meeting up with the gathered reinforcements on the way. When the army left the Basin of Mexico, it may have included as many as 20,000 native warriors from various kingdoms although the exact numbers are disputed. By the time the army crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the massed native warriors included 800 from Tlaxcala, 400 from Huejotzingo, 1600 from Tepeaca plus many more from other former Aztec territories. Further Mesoamerican warriors were recruited from the Zapotec and Mixtec provinces, with the addition of more Nahuas from <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> garrison in Soconusco.|$|E
5|$|Some dances that abound at Carnival and Corpus Christi fiestas {{go back to}} pre-Conquest ritual combat dances of the Aztecs. For example, {{during the}} 15th month of <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> calendar, Huitzilopochtli, god {{of the sun and}} war was honored by real duels between slave victims and mimed battles among masked boy votaries.|$|E
50|$|Huitzilopochtli {{was also}} a tribal god and a legendary wizard of <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b> Originally he was of little {{importance}} to the Nahuas, but after the rise of <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs,</b> <b>the</b> Nahuals reformed their religion and put Huitzilopochtli {{at the same level}} as Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca, making him a solar god. Huitzilopochtli is presented as the deity who guided the long migration <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> undertook from Aztlan, their traditional home, to the Valley of Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{purpose of}} the flower war, {{according}} to Hassig, was to show <b>the</b> superiority of <b>Aztec</b> troops. This was another reason that equal numbers of troops were used. If <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> tried to use numerical superiority, their enemy would resort {{to the kind of}} defensive tactics that <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> had trouble fighting against. With equal numbers, the enemy would fight <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> on <b>the</b> open field, where individual soldiers had a greater chance of showing off their martial ability. Finally, according to Hassig, “propaganda was perhaps the most significant purpose of flower wars." [...] By engaging their opponents in the flower war, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> were able to continuously showcase their force, which warned other city-states about their power. If <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> made enough of a show of force, it could encourage the allies of the Aztecs' enemies to change their allegiance.|$|R
50|$|Cholula was {{significant}} during the Spanish Colonial period {{because it was}} one of the nearby provinces that remained unconquered by <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b> They were instrumental in helping the Spanish overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aztec</b> civilization {{shared this}} image of the jaguar as the {{representative}} of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the Jaguar Knights. In Aztec mythology, the jaguar was considered to be the totem animal of the powerful deity Tezcatlipoca.|$|E
5|$|The endings {{of the two}} {{poems are}} the same but have {{opposite}} results: they both have a sunset and an exodus from the country, but the first deals with Wales and the second with <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> lands. The first is messianic and heralds a return of Wales's greatness, and the second deals with a new country being created.|$|E
5|$|Tonatiuh, <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> {{god of the}} sun, {{was usually}} {{depicted}} holding arrows and a shield and was {{closely associated with the}} practice of human sacrifice. The sun goddess Amaterasu is the most important deity in the Shinto religion, and she {{is believed to be the}} direct ancestor of all Japanese emperors.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of peanuts}} dates to <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> and Incas, and peanut paste {{may have been}} used by <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> as a {{toothache}} remedy in the first century of the Common Era (CE).|$|R
50|$|The Tlaxcalans main {{city was}} Tlaxcala. After {{almost a century}} of {{fighting}} the Flower Wars, {{a great deal of}} hatred and bitterness had developed between the Tlaxcalans and <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> had already conquered most of the territory around Tlaxcala, and waged war on them every year. It has been suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> left Tlaxcala independent so that they would have a constant supply of war captives to sacrifice to their gods.|$|R
5000|$|Spirulina was a {{food source}} for <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> and other Mesoamericans until the 16th century; the harvest from Lake Texcoco and {{subsequent}} sale as cakes were described {{by one of}} Cortés' soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> called it [...] "tecuitlatl".|$|R
5|$|Butterflies have {{appeared}} in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species {{were considered to be}} the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilisations.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 the Kaqchikel {{suffered}} from a plague of locusts. The following year, in 1514, Iximche was severely damaged by a fire. A plague, described as terrible in the Annals of the Kaqchikel, struck the city in 1519 and lasted two years, resulting in {{a large number of}} deaths. This was likely to have been smallpox brought to the Americas with the Spanish. After <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish onslaught in 1521, the Kaqchikel sent messengers to Hernán Cortés offering an alliance with the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two decades of the 16th century, the Spanish {{established}} their domination over the islands of the Caribbean Sea, and used these as a staging point to launch their campaigns of conquest on the continental mainland of the Americas. From Hispaniola, the Spanish launched expeditions and campaigns of conquest, reaching Puerto Rico in 1508, Jamaica in 1509, Cuba in 1511, and Florida in 1513. The Spanish heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland {{to the west of}} their Caribbean island settlements and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. The Spanish conquered a large part of Mexico within three years, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. The conquest of Central America that followed was effectively an extension of the campaign that overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> Empire.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> {{have had}} recent success {{competing}} in their conference and nationally. <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> gained national attention by finishing second at the 2010 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a tournament that was broadcast live on NBC. <b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> reached <b>the</b> quarterfinals of the 2011 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, before losing to eventual champions Life University.The Aztecs won their conference in 2012, {{and reached the}} semifinals of the 2012 national playoffs by defeating Santa Clara 59-14 in the round of 16 and beating UC Santa Barbara 47-25 in <b>the</b> quarterfinals.The <b>Aztecs</b> won <b>the</b> 2012 California 7s tournament, beating Cal Poly 36-12 in the finals. This victory qualified <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> for <b>the</b> 2012 USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships, where they notched a 4-2 record including a win against rival Cal.|$|R
50|$|The town of Tecaxic was conquered by the mexicas {{and became}} {{dominated}} by <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> at about 1476 AD., {{during the reign}} of Tlatoani Axayacatl. As the city was destroyed, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> built a new city that was then called Calixtlahuaca.|$|R
50|$|During Cortés' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan {{obtained}} {{information that}} <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> {{were about to}} attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple. In retaliation, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named Cuitláhuac.|$|R
5|$|Oxlahuh-Tz'i' died on 23 July 1508 and was {{succeeded by}} his son Hun-Iq'. Kablahuh-Tihax died on 4 February 1509 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Lahuh-Noh. The Kaqchikel {{continued}} their wars against the K'iche' kingdom over the following decade. <b>The</b> <b>Aztec</b> emperor Moctezuma II sent messengers to the Kaqchikel in 1510, warning of strangers in the Caribbean. In 1512 he sent another messenger (named as Witz'itz'il) warning of {{the arrival of the}} Spanish in Yucatán and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title because it is <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{of strangers}} on the Atlantic coast reached Chiapas {{long before the}} {{physical}} presence of Spaniards in the region. This was followed by messengers from <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> emperor, Moctezuma II, to the K'iche' Maya of the Guatemalan Highlands, warning them to prepare for war against the Spanish intruders. This was soon followed by news that the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the conquistadores. A mixed embassy that included Chiapanecas, K'iche's and Kaqchikel Maya visited Hernan Cortés in the recently conquered Aztec capital, and were well received.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> {{first began}} playing during the 1921-22 {{basketball}} season {{as part of}} the Southern California JC conference. They competed in Division III until 1956. They competed in 6 NAIA tournaments. Runners up in 1939 and in 1940, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> finally prevailed and won the 1941 NAIA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. They became a NCAA Division I school in 1970 and moved to the Western Athletic Conference in 1978. In 1999 <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> left <b>the</b> WAC and became a charter member of the Mountain West Conference. Prior to entering the Mountain West, they went to 3 NCAA Conference tournaments.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Aztecs</b> {{were not}} able to grow cacao themselves, as their home in the Mexican {{highlands}} was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire. Those who lived in areas ruled by <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> were required to offer cacao seeds in payment of the tax they deemed [...] "tribute". Cocoa beans were often used as currency. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cacao beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.|$|R
5|$|Soconusco was an {{important}} communication route between the central Mexican highlands and Central America. It had been subjugated by <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> Triple Alliance {{at the end of}} the 15th century, under the emperor Ahuizotl, and paid tribute in cacao. The highland K'iche' dominated the Pacific coastal plain of western Guatemala. The eastern portion of the Pacific plain was occupied by the non-Maya Pipil and Xinca.|$|E
5|$|Stone's {{first wife}} Maria died in Washington, D.C., shortly after Stone's release from Fort Hamilton.

Stone was also an original founding member of <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> Club of 1847, a social organization for officers who served in the Mexican–American War.|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with inset obsidian blades similar to <b>the</b> <b>Aztec</b> macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, {{the horse and}} firearms.

50|$|After the Spanish conquest, Catholic missionaries campaigned {{against the}} {{cultural}} tradition of <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs,</b> dismissing <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> as idolaters, {{and the use}} of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, like other pre-Christian traditions, were quickly suppressed. The Spanish believed the mushroom allowed <b>the</b> <b>Aztecs</b> and others to communicate with devils. In converting people to Catholicism, the Spanish pushed for a switch from teonanácatl to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist. Despite this history, in some remote areas the use of teonanácatl has remained.|$|R
