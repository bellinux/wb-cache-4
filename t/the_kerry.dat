5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 335 mares and 51 stallions {{registered}} with the Irish registry, which included 59 new foals that year. Herd numbers have steadily increased since registrations began in 2005. These numbers make <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony third in population numbers among Irish breeds, behind the Connemara pony and the Irish Draught. Despite the increasing numbers, the breed is still considered to be critically endangered by the Equus Survival Trust. The horses are administered by <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony Co-Operative Society of Ireland (formerly <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony Society), {{which is based in}} Ireland with a branch in Great Britain. Inspections are required before ponies are allowed into the studbook. The book is divided into four classes: Class 1 ponies meet all requirements, Class 2 ponies do not meet the height requirement, Class 3 ponies do not meet the color requirements, and Class 4 ponies have yet to submit to an official inspection. The breed association has hosted an annual breed show and sale in Glenbeigh, County Kerry since 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, John Mulvihill, who {{operated}} the Red Fox Inn at <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Village in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, began {{a search for}} remnants of <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony population, despite reports that the breed was extinct. He eventually found 20 ponies that resembled those he remembered from his childhood, and removed them from the bog to his stables. In 1995, he had blood typing performed on the ponies by Weatherby's Ireland, which identified their DNA markers. Subsequent DNA testing showed them to be a unique breed that formed a separate population from other local ponies and from other breeds in Ireland and Great Britain. Of these 20 ponies, only one was a stallion, named Flashy Fox. Between 1995 and 2012, he sired more than 140 foals, and {{played a significant role}} in repopulating the breed.|$|E
5|$|Mulvihill {{continued}} {{breeding and}} promoting the ponies, and in 2002, the breed was recognised by the Irish Government as the Irish Heritage Pony. The same year, <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony Society was formed. Also in 2002, Americans {{became interested in}} the breed, and the first ponies were exported from Ireland to the US in 2003, to a farm in Ohio. In 2005, the American Kerry Bog Pony Society was founded, with 11 initial registrants. Also in 2005, the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission recognised <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony as an official breed; the following year, the Irish Horse Board issued the first equine passports for members of the breed. Until 2009, there was an exception in place that allowed unrelated ponies that met the physical breed standards to be bred as Kerry Bog Ponies, with the offspring being registered and given passports certifying them as purebred Kerry Bog Ponies. This was in part due to a concern of inbreeding among the small number of ponies initially registered. Kerry Bog Ponies were also part of the Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme (closed to new applicants in 2009), which financially rewarded farmers for using environmentally-friendly methods. <b>The</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Village, an open-air museum on the Ring of Kerry is one location that breeds and houses part of the existing Kerry Bog Pony population.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ancestry of <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony is unknown, {{but there}} were horses living a feral existence in peat bogs {{in what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland since at least the 1600s. Some enthusiasts claim that the breed is a descendant of the ancient Irish Hobby. In a 1617 book illustration, the horses pictured resemble both <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Bog Pony of today and the original Irish Hobby, showing the two breeds' similar morphology. Originally, Kerry Bog Ponies were used to transport peat and kelp. They were known for their ability to navigate through the bogs, around soft spots and over rocks often in wet and windy weather, and for their strength relative to their small size. Some were trained to work in harness and used to pull carts. The ponies were turned loose into the peat bogs when they were not needed, then later re-caught for work. Few if any breeding programs existed; instead, they were left to reproduce in their feral setting. In 1720, Isaac Ware travelled to County Kerry and observed that the horses resembled Asturcón ponies from Spain.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a {{hardy breed}} that can scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they spend the whole year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered once or twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, <b>the</b> <b>Kerry</b> Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E

5|$|Kerry {{returned}} to Australia in 1980 {{for the national}} championships and gained selection for the Moscow Olympics by winning the backstroke double.

After the games, Kerry took an extended break from the sport, before returning for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He claimed a bronze in the medley relay and came fifth in the 100m backstroke. He then retired and took up a television and modelling career in the United States.
