25|$|DTSO(B) {{originally}} {{featured a}} lockable sliding door between the driving cab {{and the first}} set of power doors and tip-up longitudinal seating to enable parcels to be carried securely. This facility was rarely used and the sliding door has since been removed – but the <b>tip-up</b> <b>seat</b> area has been retained for carrying bicycles and wheelchairs.|$|E
50|$|The Department of Transport was keen to see {{wheelchair}} accessible taxis and the FX4W wheelchair conversion, which was available from early 1986, enabled the FX4 {{to provide that}} facility. In this, the curb side passenger door was made capable of opening 180° and the nearside part of the partition could be moved forward to accommodate the rearward facing wheelchair {{in place of the}} nearside <b>tip-up</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Rail {{networks}} {{often do}} not overbook reserved seats. With many networks, including the UK and French systems, a contrast is offered between advance-purchase tickets, which do guarantee a (specific) seat and are therefore often non-refundable, and [...] "walk-on" [...] tickets purchased {{on the day of}} travel, which do not; these passengers may be forced to stand or take a <b>tip-up</b> <b>seat</b> in a vestibule. Rail networks face less pressure in this than airlines, which cannot allow passengers to stand. Rail networks accordingly {{often do not}} have a centralised booking system; as passengers can stand, tickets can be sold from automated machines and clerks with no knowledge of how many people intend to board a train. In addition, rail networks {{have to deal with the}} unpredictable nature of season ticket holders, who have purchased a right to make unlimited use of a route; these passengers may often be allowed to join any train but not guaranteed a seat.|$|E

50|$|The Atribo is a {{development}} of the earlier Pesa 218M. It features a low floor and is designed for regional, non-electrified lines. The train features two toilets, {{one of which is}} accessible to disabled people. The trains can operate with up to three sets in multiple. The Italian version has 21 seats in first class (in the 2 + 1) and 129 fixed and 4 <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> in the 2nd class.

50|$|Able to seat four or five, all the {{passengers}} were carried between the axles, for maximum comfort, while {{the driver was}} alone at the front, to maximize view. With the 1923 model, two <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> were added.|$|R
5000|$|The {{one-piece}} railcars have [...] {{engines and}} a maximum speed of 120 km/h. The train has 52 2nd class seats, eight 1st class 1 <b>seats</b> and 13 <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats.</b> Up to three cars can run together in multiple unit form.|$|R

50|$|Four production-series {{cars were}} then {{delivered}} from Fuji Heavy Industries in March 1991. These were each equipped with one Komatsu DMF11HZ 330 hp engine. Differences {{from the four}} pre-production series cars included abandoning of the three pairs of <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> near the doorways, and elimination of the dummy exterior window at the toilet position.|$|R
50|$|To {{be able to}} turf the pitch, {{and other}} areas, a turf fund was put into place which raised a total of £900 to cover the work. A stand was erected {{at the cost of}} £2,000, which was paid by the Rugby Football League. It held 1,500 on a mixture of benches and <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Over {{the years}} <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> have {{replaced}} loose chairs. The pillars {{that supported the}} side galleries were removed in the 1950s and the curved gallery was re-built straight, to accommodate the new supporting girder. At that time {{the back wall of}} the stalls was removed and the auditorium extended back to allow the stalls to accommodate another four rows of seats.|$|R
50|$|On {{the half}} way line {{there is an}} {{integrated}} press box and dugout structure, which includes a gantry for television cameras. The covered Arthur Simpson Stand, with two rows of bench seating, runs down to the Claudine Morley Stand, a standing terrace which runs along {{the south end of}} the pitch. The Main Stand has four rows of individual <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> which provide covered seating for approximately 250 spectators.|$|R
5000|$|The theatre's {{interior}} was extensively rebuilt by Alfred Darbyshire in 1869. The work included {{the addition of}} 300 seats, and featured a frieze over the proscenium painted by Henry Stacy Marks showing Shakespeare flanked by muses and his principal characters. The Prince's was the first theatre to introduce <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> and [...] "early doors" [...] tickets, which for a premium allowed patrons to enter the theatre early, to avoid the usual opening-time crush.|$|R
50|$|The TX4 {{features}} a new front radiator grille, an updated interior design, updated {{front and rear}} bumpers, and a different rear vehicle registration number plate surround compared to the TXII. There are now internal headrests {{as a result of}} EU safety regulations. On the earlier models there were two headrests fitted to the central partition for the rear-facing <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats,</b> but on the later models these were removed as drivers complained and found them awkward for vision reasons.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 {{it looked}} as if BLTC would, once more, lose its theatre, for the club was {{annually}} in the red to the tune of about £4,000 - sometimes playing to a capacity of only 30%. But the club decided to fight back by active marketing, the build of an accurate database of patrons and regular mail shots. A raked auditorium (with <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats)</b> was built in 2000 and a newsletter developed which was sent (bi monthly) to both members and non-members.|$|R
50|$|Following {{purchase}} {{they were}} fitted with steam heating, vacuum ejectors, sliding cab windows, additional lamp irons and new cylinder drain cocks. Further modifications became necessary once the locomotives started to enter traffic, including large roof-top ventilators, British-style regulators (as built they had US-style pull-out ones), three rectangular cab-front lookout windows, extended coal bunkers, separate steam and vacuum brake controls and wooden <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats.</b> This {{meant that it}} took until November 1947 for the entire class {{to be ready for}} work. Telephones were later installed on the footplate to improve communication on the vast network of sidings at Southampton.|$|R
5000|$|The Class 315 fleet {{transferred}} to new operator Abellio Greater Anglia in February 2012. Abellio repainted the trains {{in its own}} livery, and undertook a refresh of the fleet, including a Passenger Information System and a flexible space for wheelchairs and cycles which includes <b>tip-up</b> <b>seating</b> and 'call to aid' buttons. Abellio used the fleet for local services out of [...] to [...] (the popular Shenfield Metro service) on the Great Eastern Main Line and , [...] and [...] on the Lea Valley Lines.

25|$|The seating layout for the VLocity is 2+2, {{with a mix}} of club-style seats {{facing each}} other, and aircraft-style rows. The seats can't be rotated to face any {{particular}} direction, and seat backs do not recline. Four wheelchair spaces are provided in each set through the provision of <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats.</b> The VLocity offers economy-class seating only, although the seat width is equivalent to first class seating on V/Line locomotive-hauled services. In response to passenger feedback, the seatback angle in the intermediate carriages was made 2.5 degrees more upright than the original carriages. New deliveries from July 2010 onwards (VL42 and above) featured a changed seatback angle and new seat fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The new trains entered {{service in}} 2005 and 2006, {{gradually}} replacing {{most of the}} existing Class 80 units on the network (the main exception being services between Belfast and Larne, which were still provided by the Class 450 DMUs). The trains are capable of speeds of up to 145 km/h (90 mph), seat 201 (including 15 on <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats)</b> and have standing room for 280 passengers crush laden. The sets are numbered 3001-3023. All vehicles are powered. The individual cars are 3301 to 3323, 3501 to 3523 and 3401 to 3423. The end vehicles on each unit have cabs. 3001 is formed 3301-3501-3401 up to 3023 being formed 3323-3523-3423.|$|R

50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature {{was the use}} of transverse seating only, uncommon on the Underground. This is because it was designed for journeys which might last over an hour. Most of the seating was of the high-capacity transverse 3 + 2 arrangement. Four <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> were provided {{at the rear of the}} driving motor. Despite each 8-car train seating 448 passengers, the stock provided fewer seats than the locomotive-hauled and T stock trains that they replaced, but more seats than the S Stock which started to replace them on 31 July 2010. The stock had luggage racks and umbrella hooks, the only Underground stock to have these features, despite their presence on most contemporary British Rail stock.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a ground at Bower Fold since 1906. The current main stand was built in 1996, with the covered stand at the Town End (Joe Jackson Stand) dating from 1994. The main stand, {{replaced}} a wooden one dating from 1909, which held 500 fans, before being converted to <b>tip-up</b> <b>seating</b> with a reduced capacity of around 400 persons. The Lord Pendry Stand (named after the local politician Tom Pendry) opened in 2004, replacing a covered terrace dating from the 1950s. The Mottram End cover stems from construction starting in the 1970s and finishing in the mid '80s. The main stand, holding about 700 people, is all seated. Its opposite stand, the Lord Pendry stand has 652 seats.|$|R

2500|$|A {{new coach}} design {{featuring}} a lower floor, for easier loading, {{and a higher}} roof-line, giving better headroom for wheelchair users, was introduced in 2015. The first, Phylis, is painted lined brown and normally runs with the teak coaches. Two further coaches, Iris for the green set and Edith May for the teak/chocolate set, are under construction and will carry batteries in a compartment over one end bogie for coach lighting. As well as the wheelchair compartment, which has <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats,</b> each will have a guard's compartment with (emergency) brake valve, vacuum gauge, side ducket lookouts and a standard seating compartment.

50|$|In 1957, {{the church}} tower and lower doors {{were used as}} {{the walls of a}} {{courtyard}} for a small Welsh Congregational chapel designed by Eustace Button, who designed a number of churches in the area. This small chapel lay across the old church, with the old halls at the rear. The Eustace Button church was low with <b>tip-up</b> <b>seats</b> and a wide open-span ceiling. The Welsh congregation moved here from the Castle Street area where their chapel had been destroyed during bombing and not rebuilt. The Welsh Congregation closed the chapel in 1988 — the adjacent hall was in an appalling state of repair. The Victorian tower and doors were incorporated in the office development and the 1957 chapel and Victorian hall were demolished.|$|R
