5|$|<b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> {{occupies}} the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is the second-most-massive and second-largest body in <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> {{after the}} dwarf planet Ceres, and it {{contributes}} an estimated 9% {{of the mass}} of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have swept across <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative {{action of the}} resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Asteroids in <b>the</b> <b>{{asteroid}}</b> <b>belt</b> {{are divided}} into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> also contains main-belt comets, {{which may have been}} the source of Earth's water.|$|E
5|$|Juno, minor-planet {{designation}} 3 Juno in the Minor Planet Center catalogue system, is {{an asteroid}} in <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> Juno {{was the third}} asteroid discovered, in 1804, by German astronomer Karl Harding.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly {{between the}} orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is {{occupied}} by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half {{the mass of the}} belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E
5|$|NASA's ongoing {{investigations}} include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and {{studies of the}} Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E
5|$|Skirting {{the outer}} edge of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is the Cybele group, {{orbiting}} between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions. Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> this usually {{is not the}} case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions. Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{terrestrial}} region, between 2 and 4AU from the Sun, is called <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos; however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically. Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.|$|E
5|$|Another high-inclination {{group in}} the inner part of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is the Phocaea family. These are {{composed}} primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types. The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over {{such a large}} volume {{that it would be}} {{improbable}} to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt,</b> shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the debris}} from {{collisions}} can form meteoroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere. Of the 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent {{are believed to have}} originated in <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Himalia {{group is}} spread over barely 1.4Gm in semi-major axes, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (27.5±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.25. It {{has been suggested}} that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> {{makes for a}} very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of <b>the</b> <b>asteroid</b> <b>belt</b> now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E
