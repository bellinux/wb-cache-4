Rooms can be zoned within the buildings {{in order to}} reject sources of internal heat gain and/or allocating heat gains {{where they can be}} useful, considering the different activities of the building. For example, creating a flat, horizontal plan will increase the effectiveness of cross-ventilation across the plan. Locating the zones vertically can take advantage of <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification.</b> Typically, building zones in the upper levels are warmer than the lower zones due to stratification. Vertical zoning of spaces and activities uses this <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> to accommodate zone uses according to their temperature requirements. Form factor (i.e. the ratio between volume and surface) also {{plays a major role in}} the buildingâ€™s energy and thermal profile. This ratio can be used to shape the building form to the specific local climate. For example, more compact forms tend to preserve more heat than less compact forms because the ratio of the internal loads to envelope area is significant.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{radiative}} {{hydrodynamic model}} atmospheres of metal-poor late-type stars {{are characterized by}} cooler upper photospheric layers than their 1 D counterparts. This property of 3 D models can dramatically affect elemental abundances derived from temperature-sensitive spectral lines. We investigate whether the cool surface temperatures predicted by metal-poor 3 D models can be ascribed to the approximated treatment of scattering in the radiative transfer. We use the Bifrost code to test three different ways to handle scattering in 3 D model atmospheres of metal-poor stars. First, we solve self-consistently the radiative transfer equation for a source function with a coherent scattering term. Second, we solve the radiative transfer equation for a Planckian source function, neglecting the contribution of continuum scattering to extinction in the optically thin layers; {{this has been the}} default mode in previous models of ours. Third, we treat scattering as pure absorption everywhere, which is the standard case in CO 5 BOLD models. We find that the second approach produces temperature structures with cool upper photospheric layers very similar to the correct coherent scattering solution. In contrast, treating scattering as pure absorption leads to significantly hotter and shallower <b>temperature</b> <b>stratifications.</b> The main differences in temperature structure between our published models and those generated with the CO 5 BOLD code {{can be traced to the}} different treatments of scattering. Neglecting the contribution of continuum scattering to extinction in optically thin layers provides a good approximation to the full radiative transfer solution for metal-poor stars. Our results demonstrate that the cool <b>temperature</b> <b>stratifications</b> predicted for metal-poor late-type stellar atmospheres by previous models of ours are not an artifact of the approximated treatment of scattering.

50|$|Computational {{models for}} {{simulating}} combustion and heat release rates of HCCI engines require detailed chemistry models. This is largely because ignition is {{more sensitive to}} chemical kinetics than to turbulence/spray or spark processes as are typical in SI and diesel engines. Computational models have demonstrated the importance of accounting {{for the fact that}} the in-cylinder mixture is actually in-homogeneous, particularly in terms of temperature. This in-homogeneity is driven by turbulent mixing and heat transfer from the combustion chamber walls. The amount of <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> dictates the rate of heat release and thus tendency to knock. This limits the usefulness of considering the in-cylinder mixture as a single zone, resulting in the integration of 3D computational fluid dynamics codes such as Los Alamos National Laboratory's KIVA CFD code and faster solving probability density function modelling codes.|$|E
50|$|UFAD systems {{capitalize}} on the natural stratification that occurs when warm air rises due to thermal buoyancy. In a UFAD design, conditioned air stays in the lower, occupied part of the room, while heat sources such as occupants and equipment generate thermal plumes, which carry the warm air and heat source generated pollutants towards the ceiling where they are exhausted through the return air ducts. The <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> created by the UFAD system has implication for space setpoints. Most of an occupant's body is {{in an area that}} is colder than the temperature at the thermostat height; therefore, current practice recommends raising thermostat setpoints compared to traditional overhead systems. The optimal ventilation strategy controls the supply outlets to limit the mixing of supply air with room air to just below the breathing height of the space. Above this height, stratified and more polluted air is allowed to occur. The air that the occupant breathes will have a lower concentration of contaminants compared to conventional uniformly mixed systems.|$|E

The time the water is held before it is released is known as the retention time. This is a design feature that allows particles and silts to settle out, as well as time for natural biological treatment using algae, bacteria and zooplankton that naturally live in the water. However natural limnological processes in temperate climate lakes produce <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> in the water, which tends to partition some elements such as manganese and phosphorus into deep, cold anoxic water during the summer months.

50|$|Obersee is {{characterized}} by its shallow depth and, compared to its volume, by the very large inflow from the Linth canal. The theoretical residence time {{of water in the}} upper lake at medium Linth inflow is thus only around 10 weeks. In the near-surface layers of water, a slight upward trend in average temperature has been observed, resulting in the <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> of the lake being more stable much longer into late summer. The increasingly warm winters result in incomplete mixing of lake water to the depths. Walensee and Obersee are the main water supplier for ZÃ¼richsee which is used in turn for more than a million inhabitants as drinking water storage. To ensure the quality of the drinking water supply, the water supply authorities of the city of ZÃ¼rich therefore regularly examine the quality of these two lakes. The neighboring cantons of ZÃ¼rich, Schwyz, Glarus and St. Gallen participate in the monitoring costs. Since the early 1970s the water quality has greatly improved thanks to extensive restructuring measures. Almost all residents in the 1740 km2 large catchment area are connected to sewage plants. Although every spring a circulation of the water occurs, often a visible lack of oxygen in July below a depth of 30 m is observable, which lasts for several months.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} and numerical studies have showed that piston geometry {{has a significant}} effect on the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) process. There are two effects generated by the combustor geometry: the geometry affects the flow/turbulence in the cylinder; the geometry also affects the <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification.</b> The <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> is more directly responsible for the observed alteration of the auto-ignition process. To clarify this issue further we present in this paper a study of two engines with the same geometry but difference ways of cooling. Measurement of the two engines~a metal engine and quartz piston engine, both with the same piston bowl geometry~is carried out. Large eddy simulation (LES) is used to simulate the flow, the temperature field and the auto-ignition process in the two engines. The fuel is ethanol with a relative air/fuel ratio of 3. 3. It is found that lower <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> is established in the metal engine under similar conditions as the optical quartz engine due to the more effective cooling of the piston in the metal engine configuration. The combustion phasing in the two engines is the same by controlling the intake temperature. Both measurements and LES show a more rapid auto-ignition in the metal engine than in the optical engine with the same piston geometry.

The latest results for the Sun and Procyon show that the derived microturbulence parameter depends significantly on the numerical resolution of the underlying 3 D simulation, confirming that `low-resolution' models tend to underestimate the true value of ximic. Extending the investigation to twelve further simulations with different Teff, log g, and [M/H], we obtain a first impression of the predicted trend of ximic over the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram: in agreement with empirical evidence, microturbulence increases towards higher effective temperature and lower gravity.

This configuration is a typical scenario of smoke propagation during a fire event in a compartment. This study focuses on the vertical <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> in the smoke layer and its consequences on buoyancy flow induced at the doorway. From two theoretical approaches, considering or not considering the vertical <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> in the smoke layer, this study highlights how vertical <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> may modify the doorway flow.

The consideration of <b>temperature</b> <b>stratification</b> in the smoke layer changes the prediction of the flow through the doorway.
