5|$|A Literary Polish {{language}} breakthrough {{came under}} the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E
5|$|Alfie Karmal, {{the son of}} a Palestinian {{father and}} Greek mother, was ten years older than Mills when they met in 1986. Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery, and paid for {{cosmetic}} surgery to her breasts. Karmal, who had moved into the computer industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was not successful. In 1987, Mills went to live in Paris, telling Karmal that a cosmetics company had given her a modelling contract, but became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a photo session for a stills-only German sex education manual called Die Freuden der Liebe (<b>The</b> <b>Joys</b> of Love).|$|E

5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{observation}} on this verse is {{how hard}} {{the author of}} Matthew strives to prove <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of <b>the</b> magi. The phrase [...] "rejoiced with exceedingly great joy" [...] piles modifiers on <b>the</b> basic <b>joy</b> of <b>the</b> magi. Gundry notes that the Matthew is the only gospel to use such constructions. [...] Reid links <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> felt with <b>the</b> Magi upon first encountering Jesus with <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of <b>the</b> disciples upon doing the same at Matthew 13:20.|$|R

25|$|Benigni {{became famous}} in Italy in the 1970s for a {{television}} series called Onda Libera, on RAI2, produced by Renzo Arbore, {{in which he}} interpreted the satirical piece The Hymn of the Body Purged (L'inno del corpo sciolto, a scatological song about <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of defecation). A great scandal for the time, the series was suspended due to censorship. His first film was 1977's Berlinguer, I Love You (Berlinguer ti voglio bene), also by Bertolucci.|$|E
25|$|Charles Kickham was {{the author}} of three {{well-known}} stories, dealing sympathetically with Irish life and manners and the simple faith, <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> and sorrows, the quaint customs and the insuppressible humour of the peasantry. “Knocknagow,” or “The Homes of Tipperary,” one of the finest tales of peasant life ever written, suggests O’Sullivan. “Sally Cavanagh,” or “The Untenanted Graves,” a touching story illustrating the evils of landlordism and emigration; and “For the Old Land,” dealing with the fortunes of a small farmer’s family, with its lights and shades.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Joy</b> of Sex by Dr. Alex Comfort was {{the first}} visuallyexplicit sex manual to be {{published}} by a mainstream publisher.

Itsappearance in public bookstores in the 1970s opened the way to thewidespread publication of sex manuals in the West. As a result, hundreds of sex manuals are now available in print.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Joy</b> Steamship Company (also <b>the</b> <b>Joy</b> Line) was an {{independent}} steamship line operating in Long Island Sound {{in the early}} decades of the 20th century. It was named for its owner Allan Joy.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1899, <b>the</b> <b>Joy</b> Line {{initially}} {{competed with}} the New Haven Railroad for transport between New York City and the ports of New England. By 1902, the New Haven had pressured other steamship lines not to lease their ships to <b>the</b> <b>Joy</b> (for example, by offering free annual passes along their rail to captains refusing Joy offers) {{and offered to}} carry American Sugar for almost nothing rather than allow <b>the</b> <b>Joy</b> to benefit from its traffic. In consequence, <b>the</b> <b>Joy</b> was forced to a traffic agreement, raising its rates to equivalence with the railroad's and limiting itself to local trade between New York and Providence, Rhode Island. The entrance of the Enterprise Line along the same route led the New Haven to purchase <b>the</b> <b>Joy</b> Line in December, 1905. The competition featured in the antitrust case against the New Haven in 1915.|$|R
25|$|As {{there was}} time between SAM 2 was {{completed}} {{and it had to}} be in Tromsø, the designers took it on a tour to Bergen and Trondheim. While in Bergen the group met an old fellow student, Ivar Aanderaa, who was working as an entrepreneur. He inspired the others of <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of being self-employed and a discussion went on all night on the 23 April 1967 about starting up a computer-manufacturing company. Based on that they had a technological edge and believed to have good timing, a decision to start a company was made.|$|E
25|$|The 13th century {{witnessed}} {{a turning point}} in the portrayal of the powerful Kyrios image of Jesus as a wonder worker in the West, as the Franciscans began to emphasize the humility of Jesus both at his birth and his death via the Nativity scene as well as the crucifixion. The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions and as <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of the Nativity were added to the agony of crucifixion a whole new range of emotions were ushered in, with wide-ranging cultural impact on the image of Jesus for centuries thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Racist local laws, discriminatory social codes, {{segregated}} commercial facilities, {{racial profiling}} by police, and sundown towns made road journeys a minefield of constant uncertainty and risk. Road trip narratives by blacks reflected their unease {{and the dangers}} they faced, presenting a more complex outlook from those written by whites extolling <b>the</b> <b>joys</b> of the road.
