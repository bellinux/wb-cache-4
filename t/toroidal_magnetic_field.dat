5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> {{to the external}} poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the dynamic {{evolution}} of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone are reviewed with focus on emerging flux tubes responsible {{for the formation of}} solar active regions. The current prevailing picture is that active regions on the solar surface originate from strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> generated by the solar dynamo mechanism at the thin tachocline layer {{at the base of the}} solar convection zone. Thus the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> need to traverse the entire convection zone before they reach the photosphere to form the observed solar active regions. This review discusses results with regard to the following major topics: 1. the equilibrium properties of the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> stored in the stable overshoot region at the base of the convection zone, 2. the buoyancy instability associated with the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> and the formation of buoyant magnetic flux tubes, 3. the rise of emerging flux loops through the solar convective envelope as modeled by the thin flux tube calculations which infer that the field strength of the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> at the base of the solar convection zone is significantly higher than the value in equipartition with convection, 4. the minimum twist needed for maintaining cohesion of the rising flux tubes, 5. the rise of highly twisted kink unstable flux tubes as a possible origin of d -sunspots, 6. the evolution of buoyant magnetic flux tubes in 3 D stratified convection, 7. turbulent pumping of magnetic flux by penetrative compressible convection, 8. an alternative mechanism for intensifying <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> to significantly super-equipartition field strengths by conversion of the potential energy associated with the superadiabatic stratification of the solar convection zone, and finally 9. a brief overview of our current understanding of flux emergence at the surface and post-emergence evolution of the subsurface <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{will show}} the {{importance}} of coexistence of oppositely flowing φ-currents for magnetized stars to sustain strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> within the stars by an- alyzing stationary states of magnetized stars with surface currents which flow {{in the opposite direction}} with respect to the bulk currents within the stars. We have imposed boundary conditions for currents and <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> to vanish outside the stars. It {{is important to note that}} these boundary conditions set an upper limit for the total current within the stars. This upper limit for the total current results in the presence of an upper limit for the magnitude of the energy for the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> of the stars. If the stars could have the toroidal surface currents which flow in the opposite directions to the internal toroidal currents, the positively flowing inter- nal toroidal currents can become stronger than the upper limit value of the current for configurations without surface toroidal currents. Thus the energies for the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> can become much larger than those for the magnetized stars with- out surface toroidal currents. We have also analyzed the same phenomena appearing in spherical incompressible stars for dipole-like <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> with or without sur- face toroidal currents by employing the zero-flux-boundary method. We have applied those configurations with surface toroidal currents to magnetars and discussed their flares through which magnetic helicities could arise outside the stellar surfaces.

40|$|Ap star {{magnetism}} {{is often}} attributed to fossil <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> {{which have not}} changed much since the pre-main-sequence epoch of the stars.

We suggest that the Ap star magnetism is not a result of stable configurations, but is the result of an instability based on strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> buried in the stars. The highly nonaxisymmetric remainders of the instability are reminiscent of the diversity of fields seen on Ap stars.

Super {{magnetized}} {{neutron stars}} of ~ 10 [15] G, magnetars, and magnetized protoneutron stars born after the magnetically-driven supernovae {{are likely to}} have very strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Methods. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations were performed to prepare isentropic neutron stars with <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of rotations on the stability, simulations were done for both nonrotating and rigidly rotating models. Results. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler instabilities in both the nonrotating and rotating models. For both nonrotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary instability predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The interchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that the Parker instability cannot be suppressed even if the stars rotate rapidly. This finding does not agree with the perturbation analysis, because rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable; therefore, in the presence of stellar pulsations that deform the rotational profile, unstable regions develop with a negative gradient of the angular momentum profile. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited. In contrast to the axisymmetric case, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> never reach a state of equilibrium after the the turbulence develops. Conclusions. Isentropic neutron stars with strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are always likely to be unstable against the Parker instability.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the stabilities of neutron stars with strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> against non-axisymmetric perturbation. The {{motivation}} comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of ∼ 10 ^ 15 G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the magnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of rotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and rigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler instabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both non-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary instability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The interchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that rapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this finding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is that rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in the presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed, unstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is developed. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited. Contrary to the axisymmetric case, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> never reach an equilibrium state after the development of the turbulence.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds/jets from a geometrically thin accretion disk with rotation, MHD equations are written in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates with axes parallel and perpendicular to the streamlines, respectively. In contrast to the current models of MHD winds/jets, only the <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are taken into consideration. It is demonstrated using a simple model that steady rotating wind-type MHD jets can be accelerated by the magnetic pressure and tension of <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> When the streamlines are diverging, MHD winds are a centrifugally-driven type, like that from a rotating star without a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> In such a case, the magnetic pressure initiates wind near the disk, although the magnetic tension acts to suppress any acceleration of the flow. For almost vertical streamlines, the magnetic pressure of the toroidal fields drives steady jets which have a terminal speed comparable to the rotational speed of the disk. Finally, if the Alfven speed near the disk is significantly larger than the Keplerian speed, the streamlines converge towards the rotation axis.
