5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>set</b> off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
25|$|Trucking {{industry}} talks {{began again}} in January 1985. Presser pushed for {{limits on the}} use of non-union subcontractors and subsidiaries, as well as wage and pension increases.

Then occurred an incident <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>set</b> back Los Angeles organizing for years: on October 10, 1910, a bomb exploded at the Los Angeles Times newspaper plant that killed 21 workers.|$|E

While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.|$|E
25|$|In August, 2015, San Francisco Supervisor John Avalos {{announced}} plans to introduce an ordinance <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>set</b> a “San Francisco Right-of-Way Policy” that would make citations for bicyclists who safely yield at stop signs the lowest law enforcement priority. Running a stop sign would still be illegal, but the police would be discouraged from enforcing it, making this a proxy for a stop-as-yield law. The bill was passed in an initial vote by the Board of Supervisors on December 16, 2015. However, on January 20, 2016, the Mayor vetoed the bill.|$|E

This was a clear but vital breach in the limits of psychohistorical theory, as psychostatistics is meaningful only with planetary numbers, and not with individuals.|$|E

In response, President Jacques Chirac of France urged Germany in June 2000 to join France in spearheading a core group of European Union countries that would move faster than others toward political and economic union.|$|E

25|$|Both teams {{started off}} with drives <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>set</b> {{the tone for the}} rest of the game. New York got the ball first and drove to midfield before losing it when Glenn Blackwood intercepted Todd's pass. On the first play after the turnover, Miami gave the ball right back with a pass that was picked off by Jets safety Ken Schroy. In the second quarter, Dolphins quarterback David Woodley broke free for a 17-yard run to his 39-yard line, which turned out to be the longest run of the day for either team. However, running back Tony Nathan lost a fumble on the next play, though the Jets still failed to get any points with a {{possession}} starting at the Miami 41.|$|E

The amendment to the Canada Elections Act, however, did not touch the governor general's prerogative to dissolve parliament or call elections, as such is a constitutional matter. Thus, the prime minister may advise such a move whenever he or she feels is prudent. The first election after the amendment was implemented occurred earlier than the date prescribed by the act; Harper argued {{that he had to}} advise an election be called because the minority parliament had become dysfunctional.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} officially {{announced}} by Capcom at their press conference during the 2010 Tokyo Game Show in September, confirming an earlier rumour in the May 2010 issue of Game Informer {{which said that}} the fifth Devil May Cry game would be developed by Ninja Theory. The Japanese Capcom staff told the Western staff to make a game with a different direction. Although their previous game, Devil May Cry 4, was a commercial success the staff thought about rebooting the series taking into account how other game series had better sales. They chose Ninja Theory, impressed with their work on Heavenly Sword which the staff thought would work with a Devil May Cry game. Ninja Theory's creative director Tameem Antoniades stated that DmCs system would contain mechanics <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>set</b> him apart from other action titles, in particularly Bayonetta, developed by PlatinumGames and directed by the creator of Devil May Cry, Hideki Kamiya. Lead producer Alex Jones stated they still wanted to compete with Platinum in terms of gameplay and storytelling. The idea of a town being alive that wishes to kill the player was added a new element never seen before in the Devil May Cry series. The actions of Limbo Town are inspired by previous Devil May Cry games, where the environments would close whenever Dante was surrounded by enemies. Combat designer Rahni Tucker commented on how newcomers to the series have difficulties understanding how advance players from the classic Devil May Cry games could perform several combos that combined multiple skills and weapons. As a result, she designed the combat to be appeal to newcomers {{so that they could}} easily perform elaborated combos, while still offering gameplay that advance players would enjoy.|$|E

25|$|Croatian {{linguist}} Ljudevit Gaj {{devised a}} uniform Latin alphabet for Croatian in 1835, while in 1818, Serbian linguist Vuk Karadžić {{had developed a}} Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. In {{the first half of}} the 19th century, the Illyrian movement to unite all Southern Slavs (Yugoslavs) culturally, and perhaps also politically, was quite strong, and efforts were made to create a unified literary language <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>set</b> the standard for all Yugoslav dialects. The Vienna Literary Agreement (March 1850) between writers from Croatia, Serbia and one from Slovenia was the most significant attempt, where some basic rules were agreed upon. In the 1860s, Vuk's orthography gained acceptance in Serbia, while a Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts was founded in 1866 in Zagreb and the first 'Serbo-Croatian' grammar book by Pero Budmani was published in Croatia in 1867. In 1913, Jovan Skerlić proposed a compromise for a single writing system and dialect to create true language unity. After World War I, political unity was realised in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but an agreement on scriptural unity for its population was never reached. The post-war Titoist Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia made another attempt at achieving linguistic unity, but the 1954 Novi Sad Agreement only managed to get equality of Latin and Cyrillic, and an obligation for all citizens to learn both alphabets. With the return of ethnic nationalism in the 1980s, the two again became heavily associated with particular variants of the Serbo-Croatian language and thus with national identities. Exacerbated by the Yugoslav Wars that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, nationalists on all sides resumed insisting Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin were distinct languages in their own right, undermining the project of Serbo-Croatian linguistic unity.|$|E
