5|$|Sucker Punch made {{suggested}} improvements {{they would}} like to see for the DualShock 4 gamepad. Second Sons designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found they were able to adopt the DualShock 4's <b>touchpad</b> into Second Sons gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 <b>touchpad).</b>|$|E
5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the <b>touchpad</b> that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive <b>touchpad</b> due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Released in Japan on December 17, 2011 and North America on February 22, 2012, the PlayStation Vita was {{previously}} codenamed Next Generation Portable (NGP). It was officially unveiled by Sony on January 27, 2011 at the PlayStation Meeting 2011.

5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the <b>touchpad</b> and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation TV, {{known in}} Asia as PlayStation Vita TV, is a microconsole and a non-portable {{variant of the}} PlayStation Vita handheld. It was {{announced}} on September 9, 2013 at a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan presentation. Instead of featuring a display screen, the console connects to a television via HDMI. Users can play using a DualShock 3 controller, although due to the difference in features between the controller and the handheld, certain games are not compatible with PS TV, {{such as those that}} are dependent on the system's touch-screen, rear <b>touchpad,</b> microphone or camera. The device is said to be compatible with over 100 Vita games, as well as various digital PlayStation Portable, PlayStation and PC Engine titles. The system supports Remote Play compatibility with the PlayStation 4, allowing players to stream games from the PS4 to a separate TV connected to PS TV, and also allows users to stream content from video services such as Hulu and Niconico, as well as access the PlayStation Store. The system was released in Japan on November 14, 2013, in North America on October 14, 2014, and in Europe and Australasia on November 14, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us Remastered changes {{little from}} the basic {{gameplay}} {{of the original}} version. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. For most of the game, players control Joel; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's <b>touchpad</b> to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from blue to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players {{have the ability to}} watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring creative director Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to OEM, ODM solutions, Cirque designs, manufactures and markets its {{own line of}} consumer desktop touchpads: Cirque Smart Cat Pro, Cirque Smart Cat and Cirque Easy Cat.In addition there are a some lines of <b>touchpads</b> now discontinued and no longer supported by new drivers, although these <b>touchpads</b> have the same specifications as the current range and differ only slightly in shape and size.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the design, implementation, and evaluation with musical applications of force sensitive multi-touch arrays of <b>touchpads.</b> Each of the <b>touchpads</b> supports a three dimensional representation of musical material: two spatial dimensions plus a force measurement we typically use to control dynamics. We have developed two pad systems, one with 24 pads {{and a second}} with 2 arrays of 16 pads each. We emphasize the treatment of gestures as sub-sampled audio signals. This tight coupling of gesture with audio provides for {{a high degree of}} control intimacy. Our experiments with the pad arrays demonstrate that we can efficiently deal with large numbers of audio encoded gesture channels – 72 for the 24 pad array and 96 for the two 16 pad arrays...|$|R
25|$|Laptops today feature {{multitouch}} <b>touchpads</b> {{that can}} sense {{in some cases}} up to five fingers simultaneously, providing more options for input, {{such as the ability}} to bring up the context menu by tapping two fingers, dragging two fingers for scrolling, or gestures for zoom in/out or rotate.|$|R
25|$|The Touchstone is a {{wireless}} charging dock. While charging with the Touchstone, the <b>TouchPad</b> {{can be set}} to an Exhibition mode, allowing the user to choose to display photos in a digital photo frame, upcoming appointments, a clock, or other items (using third party extensions). The Touchstone also enables wireless communication between a HP Pre3 and a <b>TouchPad.</b> Tapping on a specific region will transfer web links to the Pre. This technology is known as “Touch to Share”.|$|E
25|$|The device sports three USB ports, a {{small but}} fully {{functioning}} keyboard, a <b>touchpad,</b> stereo speakers, and a 2 cell 2.1Ah battery.|$|E
25|$|The Touch {{surface on}} the Siri Remote is customizable. Tracking when set to Fast adjusts the thumb {{movements}} made to amplify the distance {{in relation to}} how far the thumb has moved on the glass <b>touchpad.</b> Conversely when tracking is set to slow, larger movements of the thumb on the <b>touchpad</b> will tune down the distance that is traversed on the screen. This can be of great help to those struggling with Parkinson's or other movement disorders {{to be able to}} use the Apple TV in a way that fits their disability.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{models are}} built with Texas Instruments's TMS320DA25x [...] ARM {{architecture}} and {{digital signal processor}} that makes up the CPU, while the operating system used is Texas Instruments DSP/BIOS.

40|$|We {{propose a}} 3 D {{selection}} method with multiple multi-touch <b>touchpads.</b> The method enables 3 D region selection requiring fewer actions assuming some constraints, {{such as that}} the 3 D region is defined by a rectangular parallelepiped. Our method uses an asymmetric bimanual technique to define a 3 D region which in the best case requires only a single action. We employ two <b>touchpads,</b> each recognizing input from up to two fingers, and all actions can be executed while the user is resting her arms on the table, reducing fatigue caused when interacting with multi-touch displays. The technique also supports other typical manipulations, such as object and camera translation and rotation. The 3 D region selection technique {{can be applied to}} define visualization regions in volumetric rendering or objects within a scene...|$|R
500|$|In 2014 Bic {{released}} a new writing instrument {{based on the}} Cristal, a modified pen with a rubber tip opposite the ballpoint.
