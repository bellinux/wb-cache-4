On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> in Florida State territory, Vick completed a 49-yard throw to wide receiver André Davis for Tech's first touchdown of the game.

5|$|Running back Dwayne Thomas gained six {{yards on}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play,</b> then earned {{a first down}} at the 30-yard line on an option play. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Druckenmiller completed a nine-yard throw to Still. Tech committed a false-start penalty on third down, but the Hokies made up the penalty and earned a first down when Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings at the Texas 45-yard line. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after the completion, Druckenmiller was sacked for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was incomplete, and the Hokies punted again.|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and Indiana's offense started work at its 10-yard line after a Hoosier penalty. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of Indiana's drive, Dittoe was sacked and fumbled the ball, which rolled into the arms of a Virginia Tech defender. The Hokie offense quickly {{returned}} to the field and Tech's Tommy Edwards scored on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after being set up at the Indiana five-yard line after the turnover.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the Tech drive {{resulted}} in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a first down on an end-around. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after Hyman's rush, but earned 10yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a first down, behind by 16points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the first down play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the first down. With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16–0, but the Hokies had picked up a first down inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the Tech {{drive was}} a seven-yard run by Stith. This was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Clark, but Alabama was called for pass interference during the play. After the penalty, Virginia Tech had a first down at the Alabama four-yard line. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after the penalty, Stith broke through the Alabama defense for Tech's second touchdown of the quarter. The extra point was good, and with 5:09 remaining in the quarter, Tech extended its lead to 247.|$|E
5|$|The kick was downed by Virginia Tech at the State 22-yard {{line with}} 5:22 {{remaining}} in the game. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the drive, Jones gained 13 yards and a first down at the 45-yard line of Florida State. This {{was followed by a}} 22-yard run and a first down by Jones at the Tech 33-yard line. Three more runs by Jones gained another nine yards, but rather than attempt a field goal, Bowden ordered his offense to attempt to convert the first down. A quarterback sneak resulted in just enough of a gain for a first down, and State's drive continued. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after the conversion, Rix completed a 23-yard pass to Walker for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave State a 3017 lead with 2:14 {{remaining in the}} game.|$|E

5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick. To close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was blocked by the Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field to tear down the goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Florida State {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 32-yard line with a 2017 lead and 12:08 remaining in the game. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal.

5|$|Alabama {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, which {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback. Because of the touchback, Alabama's first drive of the quarter started at its 20-yard line. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of that drive resulted in a five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard throw to Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech defense at the Hokie 41-yard line. Because the Tide was trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his offense to try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Tennessee had the ball at its 19-yard line, facing a second down and ten. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the quarter, Tennessee ran an end-around to Kendrick Jones, who ran the ball for 76 yards, giving the Volunteers a first down at the Virginia Tech five-yard line. Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed the goal line for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Kendrick received the kickoff at the Tech goal line and returned it to the 20-yard line, where the Hokies started the first possession of the second half. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play,</b> Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty. Suggs gained five yards with a run up the middle, then Vick completed a pass to tight end Browning Wynn at the 28-yard line. On third down, the Hokies were stopped short of the first down marker and punted {{for only the second}} time in the game. During the kick, Clemson committed a 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty. The penalty allowed the Hokies to retain the football and gave them a first down at their 44-yard line. On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> after the penalty, Vick completed a 55-yard pass to Davis at the Clemson one-yard line. After the pass, Suggs ran straight ahead for his second touchdown of the game. The extra point was missed by Warley, but Tech still extended its lead to 2710 with 12:19 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Because Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half.

On <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the second half, Oxendine broke loose for a 36-yard run to the Nebraska 45-yard line and a first down. Despite that strong opening play, Tech was unable to gain another first down {{and was forced to}} punt after gaining only two additional yards. The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the Nebraska 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{kicked off}} {{following}} the score, and Tech's offense began work from its 18-yard line. Though quarterback Taylor was sacked on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the drive, the Hokies recovered the lost yardage and gained {{a first down}} with the final play of the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech held a 35–24 lead.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>play</b> of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards.
