5|$|Editor Vanessa Whitburn told Chris Arnot of The Independent {{that the}} climax to the storyline was planned three {{months prior to}} the show's anniversary. When Ruth listened to a {{voicemail}} from her daughter, it reminded her of home and she called Sam <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> could not be with him. Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the truth about what happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it had been very distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E
5|$|In March 1948 {{he set a}} world flight {{altitude}} record of 59,430 feet (18,114 metres) in a Ghost-powered Vampire. The flight lasted for 45 minutes, reaching 50,000 feet in 13.5 minutes. The following year {{he went on to}} test the de Havilland Comet, the world's first jet airliner which first flew in 1949. On 23 May 1952 he flew the Comet—now a highly successful export—carrying the recently widowed Queen Mother and Princess Margaret on a four-hour tour around the Alps. At one point he supervised the Queen Mother as she took the controls. She was to dine with members of the No. 600 Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron later that night and was anxious <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> had piloted an aircraft. Cunningham continued to test-fly prototypes such as the re-built Comet 3 and 4 in the late 1950s. On 23 October 1956 he travelled to the United States and received the Harmon Trophy from President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was the most prestigious American trophy for services of civil aviation.|$|E

To avoid feeling lonely on Valentine's Day, she {{schedules}} her {{surgery for}} that day, but soon realizes she will need someone to escort her home from the dentist's office due to the aftereffects of anesthesia. She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, {{but all of them}} have Valentine's Day plans and cannot help. When Liz calls the dentist's office <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> does not have anyone to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all.|$|E

25|$|Police were {{alerted to}} the shootings at 10:15 p.m. CT Thursday, when a 15-year-old girl ran to a neighbor's home <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> heard gunshots {{in her home}} and fled. Deputies responded and found her parents, Garold and Julie Aldridge, dead inside the home. A few miles away, {{officers}} found Garold's brother Harold and his wife Janell shot to death inside their bedroom. As a result, police began checking all of the houses in Tyrone, urging citizens to stay inside their residences and lock their doors.|$|E
25|$|Lieberman called American Express {{and learned}} about the credit-card {{purchases}} on the previous evening. He posted flyers in other Century 21 stores, and later that week a clerk from the Lower Manhattan store who had been relocated to Brooklyn called <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> remembered Philip, who had come in frequently. On the evening of September 10, the clerk recalled that Philip had been accompanied by another young woman, possibly Indian. After reviewing videotape footage for three weeks, Lieberman found the recording of his wife browsing in the coat department, but without anyone else.|$|E
25|$|Diane is keen for her {{relationship}} with Mark to progress, so his hesitance upsets her. Eventually he confesses that he is HIV-positive. She pledges to stick with him although the task is daunting. She acts as a confidante, helping him {{to face up to}} his illness and seek counselling and professional help. Diane is unsettled when Mark begins spending time with his HIV+ ex-girlfriend Gill (Susanna Dawson), and when Mark proposes to Diane in June 1991, she gently turns him down. The following month she leaves Walford to go on a fruit-picking holiday in France. She telephones Frank in September <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> will not be returning.|$|E

She determined therefore to close at once with the offer of silence.|$|R
25|$|When the American Civil War broke out, the Blackwell sisters aided {{in nursing}} efforts. Blackwell sympathized heavily with the North {{due to her}} {{abolitionist}} roots, and {{even went so far}} as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> would have left the country if the North had compromised on the subject of slavery. However, Blackwell did meet with some resistance on the part of the male-dominated United States Sanitary Commission. The male physicians refused to help with the nurse education plan if it involved the Blackwells. In response to the USSC, Blackwell organized with the Woman's Central Relief Association. The WCRA worked against the problem of uncoordinated benevolence, but ultimately was absorbed by the USSC. Still, the New York Infirmary managed to work with Dorothea Dix to train nurses for the Union effort.|$|E

After Dowler telephoned her father at 3:47pm <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>she</b> would be home in half an hour, the girls left the cafe at 4:05, with Dowler walking home alone. She was last seen three minutes later, walking along Station Avenue, by a friend of her sister, who was waiting at a bus stop. A closed-circuit {{television}} camera located further along the road showed no images of Dowler. A red Daewoo Nexia, which belonged to Levi Bellfield's girlfriend Emma Mills, was photographed driving past by the same camera at 4:32 pm.
