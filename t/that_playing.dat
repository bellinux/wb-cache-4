5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, it was {{proposed}} that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for sixyears beginning in 2010. The two programs could not reach an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman's business community had expressed concerns <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> the game away from the area would be detrimental to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the second}} Heritage Classic game, held seven seasons after the original. It {{was also the first}} time the NHL held two outdoor games in one season, as it {{followed}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic in Pittsburgh. In spite of criticism <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> two such games in a season would lessen the spectacle, the Heritage Classic eclipsed all previous NHL outdoor games in sponsorship. The game's title sponsor was Tim Hortons.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack {{features}} {{a wide range}} of musical styles, including chanting, string orchestra, and percussion. Upon release, the soundtrack was well received by critics. Some complimented the wide range of musical styles, and most agreed <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> the game is not required to enjoy the soundtrack. A special edition of the soundtrack was released on October 28, 2003, featuring a DVD with a trailer, demo movie, and high quality music for Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{was also}} criticized by GameBrink.Com for feeling {{secondary}} to the gameplay yet being told in long and numerous cut scenes; their amount was {{compared to that of}} the Xenosaga series. On the contrary, Siliconera praised the story and did not report any issue concerning it, although it regretted <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> and reading the other installments of the franchise was necessary for a thorough understanding of all plot points.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term. It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017.|$|E

5|$|Kirkcaldy club Raith Rovers used Easter Road {{as a home}} venue once, for {{the home}} leg of a UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich in 1995. The match was moved from Rovers' normal home ground of Stark's Park due to Easter Road's greater capacity. Easter Road has {{sometimes}} played host to Scottish League Cup semi-final matches, {{such as in the}} 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013 and 2014 competitions. Team managers Terry Butcher and Gus MacPherson have objected to playing semi-finals at Easter Road, on the grounds that their players should have the chance to play at Hampden Park, or <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> against Hearts in Edinburgh gives them a form of home advantage. The 2014 Scottish Challenge Cup Final between Raith Rovers and Rangers was hosted at Easter Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of soccer (football) {{in the neighborhood}} flourished after the Southwest Houston Soccer Association {{was established in the}} 1990s. Prior to its establishment, a few adult teams existed, but no youth league. In 1995, Silvia Ramirez, a soccer coach, said in a newspaper article that a lack of confidence in English language abilities and long work hours prevented many area residents from creating soccer leagues. The same article quotes citizens who believe <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> soccer prevented them from joining gangs. In 2007, Diana De La Rose, principal of Jane Long Middle School, said that soccer was popular among Gulfton-area students. In 2010 the Houston Dynamo soccer team proposed the construction of a stadium near Gulfton. Instead the BBVA Compass Stadium began construction in East Downtown.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he again}} missed the opening {{month of the}} {{following}} season, Bell quickly reclaimed his status as one of Burnley's first-choice players, starting 26 league matches during the campaign. He scored on his first appearance {{of the season in}} the 2–2 draw away at Derby County, and scored twice in the 5–1 win against Grimsby Town on 2 November 1907. Bell scored the only FA Cup goal of his career in the home tie against Southampton on 11 January 1908, but could not prevent the Southern League side securing a 2–1 victory. He continued to play for Burnley when work and cricket allowed in the 1908–09 campaign, making 15 league appearances. He scored twice during the season; he scored in the 1–4 defeat away at Oldham Athletic on 14 November, and scored the winning goal in the 3–2 defeat of Barnsley on 5 December. Bell played in 101st and final league game for Burnley in the 0–1 loss at Derby County on 26 December 1908. He retired from football shortly afterwards, stating <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> football in winter in addition to cricket during the summer, combined with managing an architecture practice, was too demanding.|$|E

5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston {{was at the}} peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, before coming to the crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. The crowd of 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> for a draw was impractical, so he decided to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes after he came to the crease.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E
5|$|The 2000–01 NHL {{season was}} Daniel's {{first season with}} the Canucks. His debut was the team's {{first game of the}} {{campaign}} on 5 October 2000, a 6–3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Daniel and Henrik became the fourth pair of twins to have played in the NHL. Three days later, Daniel scored his first career NHL goal against goaltender Dan Cloutier of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Assisted by Henrik, the goal tied the game at 4–4 with 1:13 minutes left to go in a 5–4 regulation win. On 30 November 2000, he suffered a shoulder injury, sidelining him for four games. During his recovery, he was reprimanded by Canucks Head Coach Marc Crawford, who told him <b>that</b> <b>playing</b> through pain is part of being in the NHL. Later in the season, he missed an additional three games due to a back injury, shortening his rookie season to 75 games. He became the first rookie in 2000–01 to reach 20 goals when he scored on 21 March 2001, in a 1–1 tie against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Finishing the campaign with that goal total, he tied for second among League rookies in scoring with Shane Willis, behind Brad Richards. He also had 14 assists for 34 points in total. Making his Stanley Cup playoff debut against the Colorado Avalanche, Daniel recorded an assist in the opening game of the first-round series, a 5–4 loss for the Canucks. He added his first NHL playoff goal later in the series as the Canucks were eliminated in four-straight games. He and Henrik played primarily on the Canucks' third line. Daniel received one third-place vote from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year, finishing eighth in award balloting overall.|$|E
