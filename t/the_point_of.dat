5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion.

50|$|<b>The</b> triple <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{water is}} used to define the kelvin, the base unit of {{thermodynamic}} temperature in the International System of Units (SI). The value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple <b>point</b> <b>of</b> water is fixed by definition, rather than measured. <b>The</b> triple <b>points</b> <b>of</b> several substances are used to define <b>points</b> in <b>the</b> ITS-90 international temperature scale, ranging from <b>the</b> triple <b>point</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen (13.8033 K) to <b>the</b> triple <b>point</b> <b>of</b> water (273.16 K, 0.01 °C, or 32.018 °F).|$|R

5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing {{processes in}} dynamic systems. From <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view of chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{view that}} the goal of {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter. But in association with the Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are (as of 2006) yet unresolved purely mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrum}} of R therefore consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> A together with elements for all subvarieties <b>of</b> A. <b>The</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> A are {{closed in the}} spectrum, while the elements corresponding to subvarieties have a closure consisting <b>of</b> all their <b>points</b> and subvarieties. If one only considers <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> A, i.e. <b>the</b> maximal ideals in R, then the Zariski topology defined above coincides with the Zariski topology defined on algebraic sets (which has precisely the algebraic subsets as closed sets).|$|R

5|$|In New York City, {{more than}} 90% {{of the workers}} and {{visitors}} {{who died in the}} towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation, fell or jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed in the building's eventual collapse. The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> impact died as well.|$|E
