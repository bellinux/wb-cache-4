5000|$|In {{the past}} {{it has been}} claimed that the largest size that Nile {{crocodiles}} can attain is approximately 4.55 to 5 m and this can indeed be claimed as the <b>top</b> <b>size</b> normally expected in the species. A relatively modest top length is additionally supported by mummified crocodiles from ancient Egypt which rarely even approach such a size. However most crocodile biologists in recent decades accept that Nile crocodiles can exceptionally exceed 5 m when not overhunted. The maximum size that the species can attain {{is a matter of}} some controversy and reports of outsized Nile crocodiles are met with greater skepticism than those of saltwater crocodiles. As is the case with many outsized animals, the collection of voucher skeletal remains of very big specimens is rather scanty, in part because the understandable difficulty of even transporting such remains, but leaves the possibility of mistakes (such as measuring along the curves which can falsely boost the measured length) and outright exaggerations amidst [...] "hunting stories". 7 m specimens and larger have been reported, but since gross overestimation of size is common, these reports are suspect. Also, most outsized crocodiles were killed by hunters and leather-collectors without field scientists present to verify and thus one may take these claims with healthy skepticism. In the past, explorers have claimed to have seen massive crocodiles in Africa and Madagascar they estimated from 7.62 to 9.15 m, claims sometimes supported by native hunters and fisherman, however no measurements occurred and these are certain to be vast exaggerations.

5000|$|Sampling of coal is an {{important}} part of the process control in the CPP. A grab sample is a one-off sample of the coal at a point in the process stream, and tends not to be very representative. A routine sample is taken at a set frequency, either over a period of time or per shipment. Coal sampling consists of several types of sampling devices. A [...] "cross cut" [...] sampler mimics the [...] "stop belt" [...] sampling method specified by a standard originally published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). A cross cut sampler mounts directly on top of the conveyor belt, the falling stream sampler is placed at the head section of the belt. There are several points in the wash plant that many coal operations choose to sample. The raw coal, before it enters the plant. The refuse, to see what the plant missed. Then the clean coal, to see exactly what is being shipped. The sampler is set according to Tons per hour, Feet per minute and <b>top</b> <b>size</b> of the product on the actual belt. A sample is taken then crushed, then sub sampled and returned to the main belt. The sample is sent to an Independent lab for testing where the results will be shared with the buyer as well as the supplier. The buyer in many cases will also sample the coal again once it is received to [...] "double check" [...] the results. Continuous measurement of ash, moisture, kCal (BTU), sulfur Fe, Ca, Na, and other element constituents of the coal are reported by cross belt elemental analyzers. This information can be calibrated periodically to the lab data per ASTM methods.|$|E

40|$|Coal {{fragmentation}} is {{a function}} of coal type and mining process. Each unit step in the mining, handling and crushing chain of coal imparts energy to the material and impacts on size degradation and consequent mineral matter liberation and plant yields. The ability to predict, monitor and optimise this process would enhance plant design and operation, production, and hence, profitability. An empirical study of coal breakage was able to establish a relationship between coal material strength (as a function of coal type and rank), unit block size distribution (as a function of coal lithotype/stone band thickness and cleat spacing), comminution energy (using single particle impact breakage) and the size distribution of resulting daughter particles for a given <b>top</b> <b>size.</b> This relationship was used to successfully develop simulations of coal breakage behaviour in unit processes such as blasting and crushing.

Carbon oxides liberated from oxidizing coal were compared with those from the thermal decomposition of coal oxidized at the same temperature, suggesting that two parallel reaction sequences contribute to the emission of carbon oxides during oxidation.

40|$|The {{application}} of heap leach technology to recovery of economically important metals, notably copper, gold, silver, and uranium, is wide-spread in the mining industry. Unique to heap leaching is the relatively coarse particle size, typically 12 – 25 mm <b>top</b> <b>size</b> for crushed and agglomerated ores and larger for run-ofmine dump leaching operations.
