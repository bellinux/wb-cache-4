The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics.

This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E
5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records. The album is noted for {{a blend of}} regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work. Grohl <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on songs with messages that resonated on the audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from {{the birth of his}} daughter.|$|E

The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E

Downey, faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, announced his retirement in March 1950. Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue. Nixon <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> attention on Douglas' liberal voting record. As part of that effort, a [...] "Pink Sheet" [...] was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that, as Douglas' voting record {{was similar to that}} of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio (believed by some to be a communist), their political views must be nearly identical.

[...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and how he will live it and what it will mean." ...|$|E

[...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that {{have a sort of}} anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election.

500|$|With Black Ice, Brendan O'Brien {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the rock sound of AC/DC's early work on albums such as Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. He thought the two previous studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, were blues-influenced. O'Brien <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on the choruses, which he felt were {{the best part of}} the AC/DC songs, and encouraged the band to emphasise the [...] "hooky, melodic side" [...] of its song-writing, which Angus complimented, since he had [...] "never been great with harmonies". Mike Fraser said the band aimed [...] "towards The Razors Edge era, a little bit more up-tempo stuff." [...] O'Brien made suggestions about the band's performance, got Angus to play slide guitar on [...] "Stormy May Day", and told Johnson to swap some screaming for [...] "soul crooning" [...] as Johnson was a soul singer. Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band's style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive. Because of the highly demanding singing style, Johnson only recorded his vocals for one hour a day. The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes, and Phil Rudd's drumming was a consistent 4/4 time, mostly on his snare, kick drum and hi-hat cymbal. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd said, [...] "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added [...] "n AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it".|$|E

Tanioka has performed live at several events, including 2011's Final Fantasy XI-themed VanaCon; she likes to do live performances as she feels it connects her with the listener's response to her music, unlike when composing where she can only imagine audience's responses to hearing her music.|$|E

The songs written during their {{time at the}} studio are lyrically [...] "much more abstract, much more visual than before", and musically [...] "less straight-forward, more oblique". Additionally, Martin {{wanted to make a}} vocal transition from his trademark falsetto to a lower register. This is explored in [...] "Yes", where the main characteristic of the Velvet Underground-inspired song is the lowest vocals Chris Martin ever recorded - this was suggested by the producer Brian Eno, to make every single song sound different. The band's drummer Will Champion said in an interview for MTV: [...] "One of the main things we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> on with this record is changing vocal identities, because Chris has a very recognizable voice." [...] Coldplay sparked an interest at Hispanic influences after having recorded in churches and in Spanish-speaking countries such as in Mexico in North America and Spain in Europe, such as Barcelona. However, it was stressed that the influence was not in any specific sound but a general feel to the songs taken as a whole. On their website, the band also described taking acoustic guitars and basic recording equipment to churches and experimenting with particular sounds.|$|E
