25|$|Other {{proposals}} for alleviating {{the pressure on}} New Street station have also been suggested. These include the lengthening of trains, however, this has been criticised by Arup who claim {{that there are many}} stations that are unable to take trains any longer than they currently are. They used the Cross-City Line as an example, showing that stations can currently take a maximum of six carriages and that the lengthening proposals would increase <b>train</b> <b>length</b> to 12 carriages.|$|E
25|$|At the new City station {{there were}} two {{platforms}} and either {{could be used by}} an arriving train, reversing in the platform. The track connections at the approach were a double slip, not a scissors, so a train could not leave while another was arriving. The left hand platform line was extended by a <b>train</b> <b>length</b> and trains could be stabled in the extension. A large diameter Greathead shield was used to bore the section of tunnel where the track connections would be installed.|$|E

25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} operating efficiency by reducing <b>train</b> <b>length</b> {{and the number}} of axles per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. Another benefit was created by permanently joining five cars in a set. This reduced the number of couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E
25|$|The Duplex {{was built}} to {{increase}} TGV capacity without increasing <b>train</b> <b>length</b> {{or the number of}} trains. Each carriage has two levels, with access doors at the lower level taking advantage of low French platforms. A staircase gives access to the upper level, where the gangway between carriages is located. There are 512 seats per set. On busy routes such as Paris-Marseille they are operated in pairs, providing 1,024 seats in two Duplex sets or 800 in a Duplex set plus a Reseau set. Each set has a wheelchair accessible compartment.|$|E
25|$|The New Haven Railroad {{folded into}} Penn Central in 1969; its freight {{operations}} were {{then transferred to}} Conrail and then to CSX Transportation. After World War II ended, rail traffic to the military bases declined until their closure in 1974. Two tracks remained on the Boston Terminal Running Track for a once-daily local freight until the 1980s. The East First Street spur closed as truck traffic to Conley Terminal increased. By 1990, reaching the Boston Terminal Running Track required a reverse move at Bay Junction, limiting the <b>train</b> <b>length</b> to just several cars.|$|E

25|$|The United States Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) {{issued a}} number of {{emergency}} orders on August 2, 2013, to all railroad operating companies in the country. The orders include a requirement for railroad companies to develop and submit to the FRA a plan to notify the agency when trains carrying hazardous materials will be left unattended as well as processes to secure the trains in their positions {{and to ensure that}} the locomotive doors are locked. Before leaving a train unattended, railroad crews will need to notify dispatchers of the number of hand brakes that are being applied on the train along with the number of cars, the <b>train</b> <b>length,</b> the grade of the track on which the train is parked and the current weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|They {{are usually}} 8-car {{articulated}} units (DSB class SA-SB-SC-SD-SD-SC-SB-SA, {{also known as}} Litra SA) supplied by Alstom-LHB and Siemens with prefabricated friction stir welded aluminium roof panels made by Marine Aluminium from Sapa extrusions, and were manufactured from 1996 to 2007. The cars are shorter than conventional railway cars; each has a single axle under one end, the other end being supported by the neighbouring car. (The end cars have two axles each). They have automatic Scharfenberg couplers at the ends; in peak hours most trains consist of two coupled units, giving a total <b>train</b> <b>length</b> of 168 meters. They have video surveillance to ensure passenger and staff security and to prevent acts of vandalism. These trains introduced air conditioning in the interior and regenerative braking to the network, increasing energy efficiency. At present, there are 105 8-car trains (840 cars).|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{units are}} still used in {{ordinary}} conversation. Today, Canadians typically use {{a mix of}} metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, {{the use of the}} metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening. Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100km and statute miles per imperial gallon, leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe <b>train</b> <b>length</b> (feet), train height (feet), capacity (tons), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).|$|E
50|$|Since central {{operation}} of the points and signals from a single signal box is convenient, and since there are practical limits for the distance to these points and signals, crossing loops can have a system-wide effect on train sizes.

CargoNet operates up to four daily trains from Oslo, plus one from Drammen.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{training}} sequence on {{the capacity of}} MIMO system is considered. Based on the ML channel estimator, the estimation-error-involving capacity formula has been derived.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the hypotheses that: (1) Job satisfaction is related to medical specialty, the physician's nationality, and length of tenure.

500|$|Most of Bolliger & Mabillard's {{roller coaster}} trains use four-abreast seating. Each car has one row of four seats, while the <b>train</b> <b>length</b> can vary between coasters.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{theory of}} the dynamics of a class of trainable signal detectors is described. Among the constructs yielded by the theory are learning curves and variance curves. A learning curve is a curve of correct-decision probability versus <b>training</b> <b>length.</b> A variance curve is a curve of the variance of correct-decision probability versus <b>training</b> <b>length.</b> The class of trainable signal detectors to which the theory is applicable consists of all those in which the training procedure (a) raises the threshold in response to a false alarm, lowers the threshold in response to a false rest, and keeps the threshold unchanged in response to a correct decision, and (b) adjusts the size of the threshold increment by an amount that depends only on the trial number, and such that the threshold can eventually reach any real number. The “learning shape theorem” is derived. By this theorem the learning curves of all members of the above class of trainable detectors are either monotonic or single peaked. The theory is based on an approximation of the difference equation of the Markov chain of the threshold's motion by a differential equation. The theory provides an over-all view of the trade-offs between performance (the learning curves) and performance variability (the variance curves) as functions of the <b>training</b> <b>length</b> of time-varying <b>training</b> procedures.
