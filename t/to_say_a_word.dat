25|$|In the Convention {{session of}} 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor of Year II), Robespierre {{and his allies}} hardly managed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> as they were {{constantly}} interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Barère and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah first {{taught the}} syllabary to his six-year old daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka), {{because he could}} not find adults willing to learn it. He {{traveled}} to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansaw Territory where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.|$|E
500|$|In a reply {{published}} on 22 June 1861, a Mr F. FitzHenry {{claimed to have}} known the Pig-faced Lady's sister, stating that [...] "Lady C.B. lived in Chelsea: her sister, Lady H.W., was much admired as a beauty. I was at a dinner-party forty years ago with Lady H.W., when all the party were cautioned previously not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> about pigs, out of delicacy to Lady H.W." [...] In the same issue, a George Lloyd claimed to have seen the Pig-faced Lady in Wakefield in around 1828–29 [...] "but {{was too young to}} take a note further than a mental one, which has haunted me ever since".|$|E

2500|$|The {{disappearance}} of the lake was no surprise to the Soviets; they expected it to happen long before. As early as 1964, Aleksandr Asarin at the Hydroproject Institute {{pointed out that the}} lake was doomed, explaining, [...] "It was part of the five-year plans, approved by the council of ministers and the Politburo. Nobody on a lower level would dare <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> contradicting those plans, even if it was the fate of the Aral Sea." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former federal {{prosecutor}} Paul Butler contrasted the way police treat a civilian suspect of [...] "a horrible crime," [...] {{with the way}} they treat a police officer under the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights. For a civilian, [...] "within the crucial first 24 hours after a crime," [...] they would read the suspect his Miranda warnings, and [...] "go to work," [...] sometimes with lies or threats. But a police officer gets 10 days before they have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

2500|$|One notable {{depiction}} is Drawing the Line, {{written by}} British playwright Howard Brenton. Defending {{his portrayal of}} Cyril Radcliffe {{as a man who}} struggled with his conscience, Brenton said, [...] "There were clues that Radcliffe had a dark night of the soul in the bungalow: he refused to accept his fee, he did collect all the papers and draft maps, took them home to England and burnt them. And he refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> even to his family, about what happened. My playwright's brain went into overdrive when I discovered these details." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1942 season {{opened with}} a game against a {{military}} team from the Great Lakes Naval Station that featured 13 All-Americans and several professional players. [...] Despite being rated as 35-point underdogs, the Wolverines held the Great Lakes team scoreless and won 9-0. [...] The 1942 season also featured the first match between Michigan and Notre Dame since 1909. [...] Ceithaml led Michigan to a 33-20 win over the Fighting Irish and scored the Wolverines' first touchdown on a quarterback sneak. [...] In a 1993 interview, Ceithaml recalled that the 1942 Notre Dame match was [...] "more than just a game." [...] He recalled: [...] "We were so revved, we could have played two more quarters. [...] The coaches never had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to get us jacked up. [...] We're Michigan. [...] And the personal pride -- the pride of beating Notre Dame -- was intense." ...|$|E
