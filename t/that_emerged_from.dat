5|$|The PSD <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the {{disintegration}} of PADESM was a powerful force in Malagasy politics throughout the First Republic. When Madagascar achieved independence in 1960, PSD leader Tsiranana was named the country's first president, a position he held until the rotaka protests forced him to resign in 1972. His administration was succeeded by the socialist nationalist Second Republic under Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E

5|$|Neo soul is a {{genre of}} popular music. The term was coined by music {{industry}} entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg {{during the late}} 1990s to market and describe a style of music <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> soul and contemporary R. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.|$|E

5|$|One issue <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> {{these studies}} {{was the problem}} of {{providing}} early warning to the SCD sites.

In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Bonnie {{were in a}} {{tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the coast of Africa on July 29 and entered the Atlantic Ocean. It moved westward, attaining convection and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon {{the development of a}} low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while 415miles (670km) east of Barbados. It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to 23mph (37km/h); after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4, it degenerated back into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Hermine was {{the eighth}} {{tropical}} cyclone and named storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. Hermine developed from a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> {{the west coast}} of Africa on September 5. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and on entering the northwest Caribbean interacted with other weather systems. The resultant system was declared a tropical depression on September 17 in the central Gulf of Mexico. The storm meandered north slowly, and after being upgraded to a tropical storm made landfall on Louisiana, where it quickly deteriorated into a tropical depression again on September 20.|$|E
5|$|After being {{classified}} as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness. A trough <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230miles (370km) of the Azores and started {{to show signs of}} deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Carmen was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season. A destructive and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> Africa {{toward the end of}} August. The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a tropical depression east of the Lesser Antilles on August29. The storm moved through the Caribbean Sea, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Carmen moved ashore on the Yucatán Peninsula, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{the first}} Eastern Pacific major {{hurricane}} since Hurricane Kenna in 2002. The sixth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Darby developed from a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> {{the west coast of}} Africa on July 12. After crossing into the Eastern Pacific, the storm became a tropical depression on June 26. The system steadily intensified, and became a hurricane on 000 UTC July 28. Darby peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, though it quickly deteriorated due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear. While Darby dissipated on August 1, the remnants of the tropical cyclone affected the Hawaiian Islands. The system produced high waves and heavy rainfall that led to extensive flash flooding. Numerous roads were closed, while minor landslides and rockslides were reported. Despite the effects, no fatalities or severe damages occurred.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gonzalo {{originated}} in a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the western coast of Africa on October 4 and trekked across the Atlantic. Despite an attendant expanse of clouds and thunderstorms, hostile winds from an upper-level trough hindered cyclogenesis. On October 10, after encountering an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave, the system developed more concentrated convection. With conditions increasingly favorable for further development, the disturbance gradually became better organized, forming a small {{low pressure area}} by October 11. In turn, a tropical depression formed at 00:00UTC on October 12, located approximately 390mi (630km) east of the Leeward Islands. Continued maturation amid warm waters and low wind shear yielded Tropical Storm Gonzalo 12 hours later. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until midday on October 12, after a Hurricane Hunter flight into the system reported surface winds of 40mph (65km/h).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Henriette was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} cyclone, eight named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. Henriette developed from a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> {{the west coast}} of Africa on August 15. After crossing the Atlantic and moving into the eastern Pacific on August 29, it developed a low-level circulation that was designated a tropical depression on September 1. The next day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henriette, and it was further upgraded to a hurricane on September 3. The storm peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. On land, wind gusts of 100mph (160km/h) were reported, knocking out power and water supplies. Heavy rainfall and strong storm surge contributed to flooding that damaged many roads; throughout the region, 800 people were forced from their homes.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Otis was a {{moderate}} hurricane that threatened the Baja California Peninsula but dissipated before landfall. Otis developed on September 28, 2005, off the western coast of Mexico, from a tropical wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the western coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean {{during the preceding}} several weeks. After attaining tropical storm status on September 29, the storm moved in a generally northwestward direction {{for most of its}} duration. It ultimately peaked at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale before beginning to weaken. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on October 3 and dissipated fully on October 5, near the coast of Baja California Sur. Preparations for the storm were completed on the Peninsula; tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared and numerous shelters opened. However, the storm's effects were minimal, and limited to gusty winds with heavy rainfall. No major damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, but poor weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had been flying above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored to intercept these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it crashing into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E

Recently successful Welsh bands include Lostprophets, Bullet for My Valentine, Funeral for a Friend and Kids in Glass Houses. The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers and bands such as Carreg Lafar, Fernhill, Siân James and the Hennessys.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Norman was a {{tropical}} cyclone that hit Mexico in September 2000. The sixteenth cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2000 Pacific hurricane season, Norman originated in {{a tropical}} wave <b>that</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> {{the coast of}} Africa on September 4, and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean; the wave entered the Pacific on September 16. The disturbance organized into a tropical depression on early on September 20, and later that day the storm reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h), and subsequently made landfall {{to the west of}} Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. After weakening to a tropical depression over land, the storm re-emerged over open waters, and made a second landfall before dissipating shortly thereafter. The storm produced heavy rain that resulted in flooding and mudslides, killing about nine people.|$|E
