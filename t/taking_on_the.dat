5|$|Ferraro's womanhood was {{consistently}} discussed during the campaign; {{one study found}} that a quarter of newspaper articles written about her contained gendered language.

5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} {{intimidation}} but also cajoling and generosity {{to achieve his}} goals. Ferdinand Marian requested compensation of 50,000 marks for <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of Süß, an amount double anything he had received for previous roles. When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing {{the importance of the}} film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E

5|$|Max Allan Collins, who {{authored}} {{the graphic}} novel, {{was hired to}} write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at DreamWorks required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> task.|$|E

5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E
5|$|Commodus {{continues}} to intimidate Oswald and murders him, causing {{a breakdown in}} negotiations. Meanwhile, Marius realizes that the band of barbarians he encountered years ago had invaded Rome and slain his father at Nero's instigation {{as a means of}} eliminating a political rival. Furthermore, the Celts, led by a just-escaped Boudica, lay siege to York, with XIV Legion tasked with defending it until Commodus can escape. In the end, Marius sacrifices himself to buy time for the final ships to sail, but is resurrected by the goddess Summer, who tasks him with <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantle of Damocles, a legendary Roman general who was abandoned to his enemies for political expediency. In that guise, Summer tells him to avenge his family and comrades, and save Rome.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's disloyalty {{led to the}} Crown {{seizing the}} castle again and <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> burden of {{repairing}} and maintaining it. The expenditure was recorded in still-surviving Treasury accounts which provide a valuable insight into {{the development of the}} castle during the later medieval period. In the 1180s the defences appear to have been a combination of stone walls (the old Roman structure) with Norman modifications, plus earthworks and timber palisades. They were maintained in part by some of the local manors, which were under a feudal obligation called heckage that required them to repair and keep up sections of the palisades.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Mantle debuted on {{the screen}} with a small role as Ewen in Christian Marnham's short thriller feature The Orchard End Murder. In 1981, he {{appeared}} in the National Tours of The Ideal Gnome Expedition for David Wood's Whirligig Theatre and Deborah Warner's play, Woyzeck, which showed at the University Theatre during the Edinburgh Festival. In 1982, he appeared in an episode of the TV series Minder, before <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> voice of Private Smith in the animated military comedy series Jane.

5|$|In ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, {{with the}} goddess Bastet often {{depicted}} in cat form, sometimes <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war-like {{aspect of a}} lioness. The Romans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe; in Roman Aquitaine, a first- or second-century engraving {{of a young girl}} holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat. However, cats possibly were already kept in Europe prior to the Roman Empire, as they may have been present in Britain in the late Iron Age. Domestic cats were spread throughout {{much of the rest of}} the world during the Age of Discovery, as ship's cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.|$|E

Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E

5|$|McHale was the show's lead {{writer for}} several years, {{and was the}} first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as {{executive}} producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> filmizing technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Eighteen series of Holby City have aired, and the nineteenth began airing from 11 October 2016. The show has run for over 800 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, and from 2004 to 2008 featured annual special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, Holby City moved to high definition broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of National Drug Control Policy, <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle {{to deal with the}} problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E
5|$|NY191 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 and Miner Farm Road (CR23) in the Clinton County hamlet of Sciota, {{located within the}} town of Chazy.

East of Sciota, the highway traversed lightly developed areas, serving several residences separated by patches of woodlands. The route eventually began {{to turn to the}} southeast, connecting with Angelville Road (unsigned CR20) in the process. A long stretch of dense forests followed the turn, with little to no development along the highway.|$|E
