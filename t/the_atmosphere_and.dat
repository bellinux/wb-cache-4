5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E

5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> outer space.|$|E
5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system.

Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck {{for a couple of days}} and some planned imaging was lost.

5|$|Free cobalt (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> {{chlorine}} in the ocean. Oxygen and chlorine are abundant {{enough in the}} upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent the formation of native metal cobalt.

Small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>and</b> frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference.

5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km above the surface. Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind drape over Mars, into <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>and</b> the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E
5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> the presence of any inversions.

These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.|$|E
