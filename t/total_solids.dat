Monitoring the creek [...] from the mouth, it {{recorded}} very {{high concentrations of}} nitrates and high concentrations of phosphates. Fecal coliform bacteria, <b>total</b> <b>solids,</b> and biochemical oxygen demand also impaired water quality. These conditions occurred throughout the year, and results for each parameter fell into the [...] "very poor" [...] category. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The minimal seasonal average for Johnson Creek on this scale was 26, the second worst in the lower Willamette basin. By comparison, the minimal seasonal average in the nearby Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years. Studies suggest that most pollutants of Johnson Creek do not come from point sources but are washed off urban and rural land surfaces during storms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One {{option for}} {{managing}} liquid livestock waste is an efficient {{separation of the}} liquid and solid fractions, and their subsequent treatment applying the best available technology. SELCO-Ecopurin is a technique which effectively separates liquid and solid phases using polyacrylamide as a coagulation agent.

This work studies the toxicity of polyacrylamide residues for the anaerobic process. It also determines the optimum range of <b>total</b> <b>solid</b> concentration for maximum gas production {{as a function of}} polyacrylamide concentration. The results have shown that it is feasible to apply anaerobic process to the solid fraction phase obtained from a separation process with a polyacrylamide concentration of 120 mg/kg, which is the usual dose used, producing a fraction with a 13 % <b>total</b> <b>solid</b> content.

Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbG) is a retrospective measure of mean blood glucose level and it is largely unaffected by recent physiological conditions and environmental events.

Here, HbG percentage, milk and lactose production traits including milk yield, lactose, protein, SNF, <b>total</b> <b>solid</b> and fat percentages and yields were measured in 485 second calved Iranian Holstein cattle. Statistically significant negative correlations were established between HbG and milk yield (r=− 0. 88), lactose yield (r=− 0. 83), SNF yield (r=− 0. 81), protein yield (r=− 0. 79) and <b>total</b> <b>solid</b> yield (r=− 0. 74).

The negative correlation between HbG and milk and total lactose production is probably related to the higher glucose demands in the lactating mammary gland of more productive cows.
