Besides glucose oxidase, the <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> contains a benzidine derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|E

The 1994 Kangaroo Tour {{was the last}} time the Australian national team played matches against British provincial teams, in addition to the Tests. Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (again, against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978. Australia adopted the name 'Kangaroos' for the July test against France, since then the team has been officially known by this name. The 1994 Kangaroo tour was also the first (and only) time that the traditional Australian <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> was only worn during test matches. For the tour games, including the friendly against Wales in Cardiff (the first time Australia had played Wales in 12 years), the Kangaroos wore jumpers that had increasing thckness gold hoops underneath the twin gold chevrons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first goal}} was {{achieved}} by understanding the structure and function of the virus. [...] Haseltine's laboratory, working in collaboration with two other groups, determined the complete sequence of the viral genome and discovered the genes that specify the virus capsid, polymerase, protease, ribonuclease H, integrase and envelop genes. [...] The first application of this knowledge was to design a fragment of the virus envelope protein {{that could be used}} to accurately detect antibodies to HIV in those infected, forming the basis of an accurate diagnostic test. This protein fragment was used by Cambridge BioSciences (Later named Cambridge BioTech) to develop a rapid test for HIV infection that could be used at home.

In one case, there was a DNA sample but the rape <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> wasn't re-run until 2010, eventually linking Blea to the rape. Blea is also suspected by police of killing a sex worker; his DNA sample was located on the inner waistband and belt of a sex worker found dead on Central Ave (a notorious street for sex work {{in the eastern part}} of the city). In addition, a tree tag from a nursery was found in the area where the West Mesa victims' bodies were buried; it was tracked to a nursery Blea once frequented. Blea, in the Mid-School rape case, was sentenced to 36 years in June 2015, at 58 years of age.|$|E
2500|$|NPC AI is {{determined}} {{primarily by the}} [...] "Fear/trust system". The trust system determines whether the NPCs will follow Blake's orders and join him in combat. To do so, the player must ensure the NPC trusts Blake, and does not suspect him of being a Thing. NPCs have four levels of trust; red, amber, green and 100%. Red means they are convinced Blake is a Thing and will attack him. Amber means they are {{not sure if he}} is a Thing, and although they won't attack him, they won't follow his orders. Green means they trust him and will follow his orders. 100% means they have complete faith in him, will follow his orders, and even if he attacks another NPC, they will support him. To gain the trust of NPCs, Blake can give them weapons and ammo, heal them, put himself at risk to protect them, or use a blood <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> on himself to prove he is not a Thing. Actions which deplete trust include accidentally shooting teammates, taking away teammate's weapons or ammo, or pointing a weapon at them for a sustained period of time to force them to do something.|$|E

40|$|Detecting and {{quantifying}} peanut residues in {{food products}} {{is necessary to}} ascertain product safety for allergic individuals and to comply with international labelling regulations. Several technical possibilities exist to analyse peanut contents in food products. Methods based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are most commonly used. However, the results often vary between different ELISA based methods due to different extraction procedures, the involvement of different antibodies {{and the use of}} different calibration materials for generating calibration curves. The calibration materials are typically crude peanut protein extracts or purified specific peanut allergens in a buffer solution. In this inter-laboratory the study of five commercially available peanut ELISA <b>test</b> <b>kits</b> to detect and quantify peanut residues in two food matrices (biscuit and dark chocolate) at four different concentrations (0 - 10 mg peanut¿kg- 1 matrix corresponding to about 0 - 2. 5 mg peanut protein¿kg- 1 matrix) are presented.

40|$|The {{resistance}} <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> is an assay {{to receive}} very quickly {{detailed information about}} the behaviour of adult insects in a phosphine atmosphere. The used concentration of 3, 000 ppm has a narcotic effect on non-resistant insects within a few minutes. Insects with a low phosphine susceptibility are still active after this time period. Using the resistance <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> we succeed {{to distinguish between the}} tolerance of different insect species, the tolerance of one species at different concentrations and of different temperature regimes. The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages. The results confirm that the resistance <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> is an effective device to recognize the resistance in an early stage, to fight against the development of resistance and to fight against the spreading of resistance.
