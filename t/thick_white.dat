The {{buildings are}} covered with <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each floor, {{with the exception of}} the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or on the roof of covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.|$|E
25|$|In aqueous {{solution}} BaCl2 behaves {{as a simple}} salt; in water it is a 1:2 electrolyte and the solution exhibits a neutral pH. Its solutions react with sulfate ion to produce a <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> precipitate of barium sulfate.|$|E
25|$|Terephthalic acid {{is used as}} {{a filler}} in some {{military}} smoke grenades, most notably the American M83 smoke grenade and M90 vehicle-employed smoke grenade, producing a <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> smoke that acts as an obscurant in the visual and near-infrared spectrum when burned.|$|E

25|$|This {{is usually}} known as curry mee in Penang rather than curry laksa, {{due to the}} {{different}} kind of noodles used (yellow mee or bee hoon, {{as opposed to the}} <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> laksa noodles). Curry mee in Penang uses congealed pork blood, a delicacy to the Malaysian Chinese community.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} bullate, fairly <b>thick,</b> <b>white,</b> spirally striate, with a {{well-developed}} periostracum. There is no spire and no umbilicus. The columella {{is smooth and}} simple. The aperture extends for the whole length of the shell, and is narrower above than below. The apertural lip extends upwards beyond {{the apex of the}} shell.|$|E
25|$|Buildings in Bintaran are {{fusion of}} Javanese-Dutch style with <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> walls, tall main door and tall windows. The area has a {{distinct}} style which makes it different with buildings in Loji Kecil or Kota Baru: the yard are more spacious while the porch smaller with many pillars. The front doors are usually louvered and the inner doors are often completed with glass.|$|E
50|$|An egg is weighed, then broken onto a {{flat surface}} (breakout method), and a {{micrometer}} {{used to determine the}} height of the <b>thick</b> albumen (egg <b>white)</b> that immediately surrounds the yolk. The height, correlated with the weight, determines the Haugh unit, or HU, rating. The higher the number, the better the quality of the egg (fresher, higher quality eggs have <b>thicker</b> <b>whites).</b> Although the measurement determines the protein content and freshness of the egg, it does not measure other important nutrient contents such as the micronutrient or vitamins present in the egg.|$|R
50|$|GMA News TV uses {{two types}} of news tickers: a silver version used for news {{programmes}} augmented with a black time bug {{on the left side}} of the screen; and a <b>thicker</b> <b>white</b> ticker for public affairs and entertainment programmes (as well as the news program Balita Pilipinas before it was removed on the schedule in 2014) augmented with a red bordered clock on the left side.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally {{the club}} wears a {{predominantly}} navy blue jersey with white butcher stripes (irregular hoops), although {{for a time}} they wore an all-navy blue jersey with a <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> bar through the middle. The numbers {{on the backs of}} the players' jerseys were normally red on a white background, although, depending on the jersey design being used, they were sometimes white on a blue background.|$|E
25|$|An {{enormous}} number of cultivars have, like the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.|$|E
25|$|The gills are free, very narrow, close, light pink color when young, {{becoming}} dark reddish-brown as {{the spores}} mature. The spore print is chocolate brown. The stipe is 3 – 11cm long, 2 – 4cm thick, cylindrical to clavate (club-shaped), equal to enlarged at the base, stout, white, smooth, with a membranous veil and <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> mycelial sheathing near the base. The flesh is solid and firm, {{with a mild}} odor. It is often confused with Agaricus bernardii; however, that mushroom has a salty odor.|$|E

In other areas the Organ Rock Shale is between the Cedar Mesa and White Rim but it pinches out east of the park. Both the locally buried Elephant Canyon and missing Organ Rock are exposed in nearby Canyonlands National Park 60miles (100km) east (see geology of the Canyonlands area).|$|E
25|$|Lutfisk, lyed fish made of {{stockfish}} (dried ling or cod {{served with}} boiled potato and <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> sauce) and green peas {{that can be}} served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include rice pudding (risgrynsgröt), sprinkled with cinnamon powder.

25|$|The {{publication}} Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives (2000) {{indicates that}} {{the flag of the}} President of Romania is a square tricolor with a white edge and a blue border. It is decorated on all sides with fringes of golden thread and, in the corners, tassels of the same material. The flag of the Prime Minister is similar to the one of the President, except that its border is yellow and it lacks fringes and tassels. The flag of the Minister of National Defense is almost identical to its interwar predecessor, being a square tricolor with the letter M written in white {{in the middle of the}} blue stripe. The Pilot ensign represents the national flag with a <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> border.|$|E
50|$|Smoke {{compositions}} used as obscurants generate {{large amount}} of <b>thick,</b> usually <b>white,</b> smoke. The most common smoke composition for pyrotechnic generation of smoke screens is the zinc chloride smoke mixture (HC).|$|R
5000|$|A {{stop line}} is always {{represented}} by a <b>white</b> <b>thick</b> traversal continuous line, but a give way line may be {{represented by a}} <b>white</b> <b>thick</b> dashed line as rectangles (Germany, France) or by a double dashed line (United Kingdom) or by a white line of triangles (Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Norway).|$|R

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{rebranding}} of the New Zealand Railways Corporation {{during the}} 1980s, a new dark blue livery {{was applied to the}} TranzAlpine, with a horizontal full-length 220mm <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> stripe sandwiching a 100mm thick red band. The name InterCity was imposed into the stripe as well. This dark blue livery would become standard and remain contemporary until 18 October 1995. In 1990, when New Zealand Rail Limited took over rail operations from the Corporation, the InterCity livery was modified to facilitate the new blue and yellow primary colours, and the red band on carriage sides was replaced by a 100mm yellow one. In 1993-1994 the yellow band was replaced by a green 100mm band, the white stripe and dark blue livery retained. In 1995, a new full-length 350mm light blue stripe, incorporating the Tranz Scenic logo was introduced on cars that were not painted all over in the new blue colour scheme. However, during the 1995 rebranding, the TranzAlpine cars were the first long-distance passenger cars to receive the new paint scheme and did not wear the transitional light blue stripe.|$|E
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and <b>thick</b> <b>white</b> pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a jug of water and goblets on a tray.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) {{have several}} {{distinguishing}} characteristics that facilitate identification, including <b>thick,</b> <b>white,</b> mucilaginous stipes, and white to pale cream, convex caps that measure [...] The gills are white, widely spaced, {{and have a}} fused or decurrent attachment to the stipe. Spores are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure about 9–15 by 6–9 micrometres. The smooth and white stipes are [...] long and [...] thick, {{and covered with a}} thick coating of gluten.|$|E
50|$|In Southeast Asia, yellow is {{traditionally}} {{the color of}} royalty, and the royal standards of Malaysia and Thailand, and the flag of Sarawak, along with the presidential flag of Indonesia, all use a yellow field as well. The crescent symbolizes Islam, the parasol symbolizes monarchy, and the hands at the side symbolize the benevolence of the government. The black and white stripes represent Brunei's chief ministers who were once joint-regents and then - after the sultan came of age - senior advisors: the Pengiran Bendahara (First Minister, symbolised by a slightly <b>thicker</b> <b>white</b> stripe) and the Pengiran Pemancha (Second Minister, governing foreign affairs, symbolised by black).|$|R

500|$|The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, {{nearly equal}} in width {{throughout}} or enlarged slightly downward, and hollow. The stem surface is nearly smooth, with white to brownish stiff hairs at the base, pinkish-white overall, and darkening with age. The flesh is moderately <b>thick,</b> <b>white</b> to pinkish, staining bright sulfur yellow. It has an [...] taste. The spore print is white to yellowish. The mushrooms are poisonous; {{as a general}} rule, several guide books recommend to avoid the consumption of Lactarius species with latex that turns yellow.|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Leccinum manzanitae are {{sometimes}} massive, occasionally reaching weights of several pounds. The cap is [...] in diameter, spherical to convex when young, and broadly convex to flattened or cushion-shaped (pulvinate). The {{surface of the}} cap is often shallowly to deeply pitted or reticulate, sticky, and covered with pressed-down hairs that are more conspicuous {{toward the edge of}} the cap. Its color is dark red during all stages of development. The cap's flesh is [...] <b>thick,</b> <b>white</b> when first exposed, but slowly and irregularly changing to dark brownish-gray with no reddish intermediate state. The change in color upon bruising or injury is often more pronounced in young specimens.|$|E
500|$|The fungus {{produces}} fruit bodies (mushrooms) {{with white}} to gray-brown caps up to [...] in diameter covered with pale pinkish-brown scales that darken in age. The tightly-packed gills on the cap underside are initially white before becoming pinkish, lilac-gray, and finally brownish as the spores mature. [...] The stout stipe is bulbous {{and has a}} <b>thick,</b> <b>white,</b> felt-like ring. The mushroom is poisonous, and causes severe gastrointestinal upset if consumed. It has an unpleasant odor similar to phenol or creosote, and develops a soapy-metallic taste when cooked. Agaricus hondensis can be distinguished from similar Agaricus species by differences in geographic range, habitat, staining reaction, and odor.|$|E
50|$|The convex cap is dry and {{measures}} up to 1.3 cm. The surface is somewhat tomentose, but especially so near the cap center. The pale pink pores {{on the underside}} of the cap angular and about 0.5 mm in diameter, while the tubes are up to 2.5 mm. The slender stipe measures 4 - 5 cm long and 2-3 mm thick. The flesh is <b>thick</b> and <b>white,</b> measuring 2-2.5 mm <b>thick.</b> There is <b>white</b> mycelium at the base of the stipe. Its spores measure 16-21 by 8-10 µm.|$|R
50|$|The nests of the {{spot-breasted ibis}} are usually found about on tree {{branches}} one to six meters above ground or water. They are solitary nesters and generally lay two eggs at a time. Reproduction occurs throughout the year, except during long dry seasons when water levels are too low. For example, in Gabon birds laid in all months except July and August, with peaks in March-May and September-December. The peaks {{corresponded to the}} local rainy seasons. Incubation takes about 20 days. Chicks are independent about forty days after hatch. As with other ibises, chicks are semi-altricial; they are born with blackish-brown down that is replaced at six days by <b>thicker</b> <b>white</b> down.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} built around a wide, central platform, with exits {{at both ends of}} the station. The floor is built in black granite and marble, with white walls and white ceiling {{supported}} by two rows of <b>thick,</b> round <b>white</b> marble-clad columns.|$|R
