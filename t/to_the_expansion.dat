5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions were important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was {{the cornerstone of}} Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E

Since it is a 128-bit numerical value, it was dubbed an illegal number.

5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> {{of the village}} but also brought in {{considerable}} numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as {{they could no longer}} find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge, {{built from}} 1959 to 1964, had been {{proposed}} {{to serve as}} the rail link. The 95th Street station was slated to be connected to the bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, because it followed the route of the planned tunnel. However, no space for any tracks was ever built because of Moses's opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of New York City public transportation.|$|E
5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became {{surrounded}} by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E

5|$|As {{opposed to}} {{previous}} expansion drafts, players {{from both the}} American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> clubs. Each existing club could protect 15 players on their 40-man roster from being drafted and only one player could be drafted from each team in each round. At {{the end of each}} round, NL teams could protect an additional three players and AL teams could protect an additional four. To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL teams could have three players chosen.|$|E
5|$|In Dalmatia, {{the golden}} jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, their diet is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of their population. In Hungary, 55% of their diet is composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the golden jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small roe deer and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be {{moving away from the}} Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the North London Line {{suffered}} a reduction in passengers and, especially, revenue, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of the bus, tram and Underground networks. In 1909, the NLR passed general handing of trains to the LNWR. By 1913, numbers had dropped to 44.6 per cent compared to 1900, and by 1921 to only 23.3 percent and the patronage of Broad Street station declined accordingly. On 8 September 1915, the station was damaged by a Zeppelin attack.|$|E
5|$|Justin Ferrell explores three moral {{sensibilities}} {{that motivated}} activists {{in dealing with}} Yellowstone. First came the utilitarian vision of maximum exploitation of natural resources, characteristic of developers in the late 19th century. Second was the spiritual vision of nature inspired by the Romanticism and the transcendentalists the mid-19th century. The twentieth century saw the biocentric moral vision {{that focuses on the}} health of the ecosystem as theorized by Aldo Leopold, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of federally protected areas and to the surrounding ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 2008, the Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System {{announced}} a $25million expansion project. The expansion added a Spanish Renaissance-themed façade to the stadium's east side. In {{addition to the}} improvements to the facility's exterior, the expansion added 1,000 general-admission seats, 550 club seats, and 26 suites. Texas Tech allocated $19million <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> and added another $6million through fund-raising initiatives. On November 20, 2008, university officials announced the project's fundraising goal had been exceeded. The expansion' groundbreaking ceremonies took place on November 29, 2008, and construction was completed before the 2009 football season.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most {{of these species}} occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species {{seems to have taken}} place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E

5|$|The 1924–25 season, {{the first}} year of NHL {{expansion}} to the United States, saw major changes in Ottawa's lineup. Jack Darragh retired and had died from appendicitis months after his final game. Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith, who had played for Canada in the 1924 Olympics. Lionel Hitchman was sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> Boston Bruins and replaced by Ed Gorman. It was also the debut season of Frank Finnigan. Off the ice, Gorman and Ahearn squabbled over ownership. In January 1925, during the season, Gorman sold his share of the Senators to Ahearn and left the Senators organization, later joining the expansion New York Americans.|$|E
5|$|The British {{demand for}} {{electricity}} increased after the Second World War. In the North East of England this led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of existing power stations at Dunston and Billingham {{in the late}} 1940s, the two new Stella power stations, {{and the construction of}} two more large stations built at Blyth later in the 1960s. This new generating capacity quickly met the demand for power. The British Electricity Authority were granted permission to construct the Stella North and Stella South power stations in 1951. The two stations were originally projected to cost around £15,000,000.|$|E
