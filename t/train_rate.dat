The 2 -dimensional XOR problem and buba data were used as benchmarks for testing the effects of the ‘new strategy’. All experiments were performed on Matlab software (2012 a).

30|$|The main {{findings}} of our paper {{can be summarized}} as follows. The theoretical framework and numerical simulations predict that workers whose productivity is improved together {{with the state of}} technology (by means of on-the-job training) tend to retire later than workers who do not receive training and bear a relative skill obsolescence in case of technological change. These findings are confirmed by our empirical results. In case of technological change, workers employed in jobs displaying a high average <b>training</b> <b>rate</b> plan to retire later than those occupying jobs with a low average <b>training</b> <b>rate.</b> Our findings suggest that on-the-job training may effectively dampen the age bias associated with technical progress.|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} role of cortical layers within auditory cortex {{has proven}} difficult to establish. One {{hypothesis is that}} interlaminar cortical processing might be dedicated to analyzing temporal properties of sounds; if so, then there should be systematic depthdependent changes in cortical sensitivity to the temporal context in which a stimulus occurs. We recorded neural responses simultaneously across cortical depth in primary auditory cortex and anterior auditory field of CBA/Ca mice, and found systematic depth dependencies in responses to second-and-later noise bursts in slow (1 – 10 bursts/s) trains of noise bursts. At all depths, responses to noise bursts within a train usually decreased with increasing train rate; however, the rolloff with increasing <b>train</b> <b>rate</b> occurred at faster rates in more superficial layers. Moreover, in some recordings from mid-to-superficial layers, responses to noise bursts within a 3 – 4 bursts/s train were stronger than responses to noise bursts in slower trains. This non-monotonicity with <b>train</b> <b>rate</b> was especially pronounced in more superficial layers of the anterior auditory field, where responses to noise bursts {{within the context of}} a slow train were sometimes even stronger than responses to the noise burst at train onset. These findings may reflect depth dependence in suppression and recovery of cortical activity following a stimulus, which we suggest could arise from laminar differences in synaptic depression at feedforward and recurrent synapses...|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional speckle {{tracking}} (2 DST) is a non-invasive technique {{used in many}} species to evaluate global and regional left ventricular (LV) function; however it received little attention in the bovine species. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the feasibility and reliability of 2 DST for the evaluation of circumferential and radial LV wall motions in calves. Fourteen Holstein black calves (age: 62 11. 6 days; body weight: 75. 25 5. 4 kg) were used in this observational study. Right parasternal short axis views at the level of the papillary muscles were recorded and subsequently analysed by 2 DST for global and regional radial and circumferential strains and strain rates, radial displacement, rotation and rotation rate. Echocardiographic examinations were performed in unsedated, standing calves by two different observers to evaluate intra- and interobserver repeatability and variability. 2 DST was feasible in all calves but 2 were excluded from analyses (ventricular septum defect and resting heart rate above 120 bpm, respectively). Automated tracking was better in systole than in diastole. Intraobserver repeatability was good to moderate for most systolic global and segmental peak values.

Variability of the interobserver measurements was greater than the intraobserver measurements.

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{system for}} {{preventing}} trains fromderailing and colliding with hazards on railways is disclose. According to the innovation, the system includes a safety vehicle (i. e., “trolley”) that travels along a railway {{a head of}} a train. Railway safety is a crucial aspect of rail operation the world over. Malfunctions follow-on in accidents usually get wide media coverage even when the railway is not at fault and give to rail transport, among the unaware public, an unjustified image of inefficiency often fueling calls for immediate reforms. This paper is designed at helping the railway administrations concerned to strengthen their safety culture and develop the monitoring tools required by modern safety management. The train and trolley each include GPS receivers which constantly provide GPS location information to a microcontroller in the train. The CPU calculates {{the space between the}} trolley and the <b>train,</b> <b>rate</b> at which the train is roaming, and the distance required for the train to stop. The microcontroller transmit speeding up and deceleration commands to the trolley and/or train to maintain a safe distance between the trolley and a train. If the trolley derail, stop or slow downward due to a hazard on the railway or another difficulty, the CPU generates guidelines to slow down or end the train, as needed, to avoid the train from derailing or colliding with the trolley or a hazard on the railway.

A materials impact program demonstrated exceptionally noteworthy performance of two woven constructions containing E-glass and PRD 49 -III (designation later changed to KEVLAR 49) fibers in an epoxy resin matrix. Thermoplastic matrices and PRD 49 -III fiber provided impact resistance at low weight which was superior to composites having the same fiber in a thermoset resin matrix. A design, fabrication, and test program showed that shaft impact resistance could be improved over the previously developed graphite composite design at a cost in shaft <b>train</b> <b>rate</b> savings. The shaft train weight savings of the most impact tolerant construction was 4. 0 % over the current aluminum shaft train. Alternating plies of graphite and glass appear to provide substantially greater tube impact durability than that provided by hybridization of the two fibers into one tape wound to a ply design equivalent in strength and stiffness {{to that of the}} alternating ply design.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{observed}} Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) continues to grow, follow-up resources need to be used more efficiently {{in order to maximize}} science output from limited telescope time. As such, it is becoming increasingly important to rapidly identify bursts of interest as soon as possible after the event, before the afterglows fade beyond detectability. Studying the most distant (highest redshift) events, for instance, remains a primary goal for many in the field. Here we present our Random forest Automated Triage Estimator for GRB redshifts (RATE GRB-z) for rapid identification of high-redshift candidates using early-time metrics from the three telescopes onboard Swift. While the basic RATE methodology is generalizable to a number of resource allocation problems, here we demonstrate its utility for telescope-constrained follow-up efforts with the primary goal to identify and study high-z GRBs. For each new GRB, RATE GRB-z provides a recommendation - based on the available telescope time - of whether the event warrants additional follow-up resources. We <b>train</b> <b>RATE</b> GRB-z using a set consisting of 135 Swift bursts with known redshifts, only 18 of which are z > 4. Cross-validated performance metrics on this training data suggest that ~ 56 % of high-z bursts can be captured from following up the top 20 % of the ranked candidates, and ~ 84 % of high-z bursts are identified after following up the top ~ 40 % of candidates. We further use the method to rank 200 + Swift bursts with unknown redshifts according to their likelihood of being high-z. Comment: 44 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables, Accepted to Ap...|$|E
30|$|A yield {{strength}} {{is defined in}} engineering and materials science as the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. Prior to the yield point, the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Once the yield point is passed, some fractions of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible. For superconducting wires, the notable degradation of its critical current dependence on the large and irreversible strain is always the considerable factor in the application. The {{yield strength}} of NbTi/Cu composite wires varying with the holding-time and strain-rate is plotted in Figure  5. It shows that the yield strength increases linearly with the holding-time at low tensile strain rate, when the strain-rate is higher (e.g., above 10 − 3  s− 1), the yield strength increases exponentially with the holding-time. Additionally, the yield strength of the superconducting samples without pre-cold-treatment at strain rate 3.33 [*]×[*] 10 − 2  s− 1 is about 11 % higher than the one at <b>train</b> <b>rate</b> 1.67 [*]×[*] 10 − 4  s− 1. And for the samples with pre-cold-treatment of 24  h holding-time at 77  K, the value can be change to about 24 %. However, {{it should be noted}} that the variation of yield strength mainly involves the yield behavior of copper in the superconducting composite at high strain-rate. It is because the yield strength of NbTi filaments in the composite is always zero at the temperature region from RT to LNT (Guan et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Zebrafish {{muscles were}} {{examined}} {{at an early}} developmental stage (larvae 5 – 7 d). Using aluminum clips, preparations (� 1. 5 mm length, 150 μ m diameter) were mounted for force registration and small angle x-ray diffraction. Sarcomeres were oriented mainly in parallel with the preparation long axis. Electrical stimulation elicited fast and reproducible single twitch contractions. Length – force relations showed an optimal sarcomere length of 2. 15 μ m. x-ray diffraction revealed clear equatorial 1. 1 / 1. 0 reflections, showing that myofilaments are predominantly arranged along the preparation long axis. In contrast, reflections from older (2 mo) zebrafish showed two main filament orientations each at an � 25 ° angle relative to the preparation long axis. Electrical stimulation of larvae muscles increased the 1. 1 / 1. 0 intensity ratio, reflecting mass transfer to thin filaments during contraction. The apparent lattice volume was 3. 42 × 10 � 3 μ m 3, which is smaller than that of mammalian striated muscle and more {{similar to that of}} frog muscles. The relation between force and stimulation frequency showed fusion of responses at a comparatively high frequency (� 186 Hz), reflecting a fast muscle phenotype. Inhibition of fast myosin with N-benzylp-toluene sulphonamide (BTS) showed that the later phase of the tetanus was less affected than the initial peak. This suggests that, although the main contractile phenotype is fast, slow twitch fibers can contribute to sustained contraction. A fatigue stimulation protocol with repeated 220 ms/ 186 Hz tetani showed that tetanic force decreased to 50 % at a <b>train</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 1 s � 1. In conclusion, zebrafish larvae muscles can be examined in vitro using mechanical and x-ray methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{influence}} of the difference between the recruitment threshold of a motor unit and the target force of the sustained contraction on the discharge of the motor unit at recruitment. The discharge characteristics of 53 motor units in biceps brachii were recorded after being recruited during a sustained contraction. Some motor units (n = 22) discharged action potentials tonically after being recruited, whereas others (n = 31) discharged intermittent trains of action potentials. The two groups of motor units were distinguished by the difference between the recruitment threshold of the motor unit and the target force for the sustained contraction: tonic, 5. 9 ± 2. 5 %; intermittent, 10. 7 ± 2. 9 %. Discharge rate for the tonic units decreased progressively (13. 9 ± 2. 7 to 11. 7 ± 2. 6 pulses s− 1; P = 0. 04) during the 99 ± 111 s contraction. <b>Train</b> <b>rate,</b> train duration and average discharge rate for the intermittent motor units did not change across 211 ± 153 s of intermittent discharge. The initial discharge rate at recruitment during the sustained contraction was lower for the intermittent motor units (11. 0 ± 3. 3 pulses s− 1) than the tonic motor units (13. 7 ± 3. 3 pulses s− 1; P = 0. 005), and the coefficient of variation for interspike interval was higher for the intermittent motor units (34. 6 ± 12. 3 %) than the tonic motor units (21. 2 ± 9. 4 %) at recruitment (P = 0. 001) and remained elevated for discharge duration (34. 6 ± 9. 2 %versus 19. 1 ± 11. 7 %, P < 0. 001). In an additional experiment, 12 motor units were recorded at two different target forces below recruitment threshold (5. 7 ± 1. 9 % and 10. 5 ± 2. 4 %). Each motor unit exhibited the two discharge patterns (tonic and intermittent) as observed for the 53 motor units. The results suggest that newly recruited motor units with recruitment thresholds closer to the target force experienced less synaptic noise at the time of recruitment that resulted in them discharging action potentials at more regular and greater rates than motor units with recruitment thresholds further from the target force...|$|E

Dutch and German <b>train</b> suicide <b>rates</b> from 2000 to 2007 were compared by means of Poisson regression analyses. <b>Train</b> suicide <b>rate</b> ratios were calculated and related to the railway parameters or population density in a Poisson regression model. The Dutch-German general suicide rate ratio was 0. 72. In contrast, the <b>train</b> suicide <b>rate</b> in the Netherlands exceeded the German rate by 1. 23. In the Poisson regression analyses, where suicide rate was related to railway density or passenger traffic intensity, the Dutch-German <b>train</b> suicide <b>rate</b> ratios became 1. 49 and 1. 20 respectively. When related to train traffic intensity or population density, however, rate ratios turned into 0. 74 and 0. 59 respectively. Train traffic intensity contributes to train suicide frequency. Population density also contributes, whereas railway density and familiarity with rail transport do not. In a cross-national comparison the availability hypothesis regarding the number of trains passing was confirmed, which leads to the recommendation of limiting access to the railway tracks.
