40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Public Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. It is the aim {{with this}} paper, to {{research}} the shortcomings experienced in <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> as contained in the Engineering Profession Act ("EPA"), {{in order to determine}} whether the process should be revised or if only certain relevant sections of the EPA should be rewritten. Due to the administrative nature of certain duties of the Council as authorised by the EPA, it makes it inevitable that appeals will follow. It is therefore imperative that <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> to <b>appeal,</b> must be both functional and effective. The relevant sections of the EPA as well as <b>the</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> of <b>the</b> Health Professions Act's will be researched, taking into account the stipulations of the Constitution and the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act ("PAJA"). Relevant legal administrative principles and doctrines, court judgments, as well as the views of authors are also taken into account. Two major areas of concern in certain sections of the EPA have been identified: • The fact that the whole council has to decide on <b>appeals,</b> and • <b>the</b> fact that such hearings have to take place within a very limited time frame. Relevant court findings {{have made it clear that}} decisions made by authorities, have to comply with the requirements set out in the Constitution in coherence with PAJA. In conclusion, based on the Constitutional and the legal administrative requirements, it is found to be necessary to rewrite the relevant sections of the EPA, as well as <b>the</b> rules of <b>appeal,</b> as these do not make the grade at present.

40|$|Excerpt] The Annual Professional Performance Review (APPR) is the {{new teacher}} {{evaluation}} system adopted by New York State in 2012. Through APPR, each New York State teacher’s performance is evaluated annually. If a teacher is rated Ineffective, {{he or she must}} take part in a Teacher Improvement Plan (TIP). If a teacher is rated Ineffective for two consecutive years, the teacher may be dismissed even if that teacher has tenure. Given these potential consequences, <b>the</b> ability to <b>appeal</b> APPR ratings and how those ratings are conducted has been a major issue for teachers and their unions. Under New York Education Law 3012 -c, which establishes APPR, each school district negotiates its own APPR procedure with its local teachers union, including any procedures for appealing the performance review. This report examines <b>the</b> APPR <b>appeals</b> <b>procedures</b> established by school districts in order to investigate the following: Which aspects of the APPR process can teachers <b>appeal?</b> Who has <b>the</b> fi nal say in that appeals process? How much time do appeals processes take? Can teachers appeal APPR issues through the regular contractual grievance-arbitration procedure? This report addresses these questions by analyzing APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures</b> for all New York State school districts. The data analyzed was gathered by coding the provisions of <b>the</b> APPR <b>appeal</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are publicly available on the New York State Department of Education website (1) ...|$|R

To show that such taxpayers will find the cost of appealing their local property taxes difficult and costly, this article discusses the issues of valuation and equalization—how and when they must be raised if they are to be successfully argued.

The study finds that the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 reignites the debate concerning the meaning and scope of EU principles.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{why most}} patients do not exercise their {{right of appeal}} against detention under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983. DESIGN [...] Part one [...] retrospective analysis of the clinical notes of patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. Part two-interviews with patients on the penultimate day before the deadline for lodging an appeal. SETTING [...] In part one, five districts in the Oxfordshire Regional Health Authority. In part two, six hospitals from three districts in the region. SUBJECTS [...] In part one all patients detained under section 2 in the five districts in 1993 (n = 418). In part two interviews with 40 patients detained under section 2 in the six hospitals. RESULTS [...] Patients {{were more likely to}} appeal if they were educated to A level standard (odds = 2. 26; P = 0. 0014) or had had a previous admission (2. 19, P = 0. 0029). Patients with a diagnosis of depression (0. 31; P = 0. 0. 15) or dementia (0. 0003, P = 0. 0001) were less likely to appeal. Compared with those who appealed (n = 12) those who did not (n = 28) showed less understanding of their rights (P = 0. 034) and poorer comprehension of sentences from the booklet describing patients' rights (P = 0. 057). The main reasons given for not appealing were not being aware of the appeals process and being deterred by having to appeal in writing. After they received a full explanation of their rights 12 of those who did not appeal said that they wished to appeal and four did so within the time remaining before the deadline. Of 40 patients, 39 said there should be an automatic right of appeal. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>The</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>procedure</b> against detention under section 2 of the Mental Health Act is not a satisfactory way of protecting the civil liberties of patients. If patients were fully informed of their rights they would probably be much more likely to appeal...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the UK the Mental Health Tribunal {{is a long}} {{established}} safeguard {{for patients}} detained under the Mental Health Act. This gives such patients an effective appeal mechanism to ensure legal protection of their liberty. This Act contains sections that allow for civil detention {{in the case of}} mental disorder. The right to apply to the tribunal against such detention is underpinned by the right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Some patients with learning disabilities may lack capacity and the ability to challenge their detention. Method: This paper presents a case study of a woman with Downs Syndrome and severe learning disabilities. Whilst this woman was detained under the Mental Health Act, she could have applied for a review of her detention to the Mental Health Tribunal within fourteen days. She did not do so because she lacked capacity to instruct solicitors. Subsequently the case proceeded through English and European judicial review. Results: The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of MH v UK (2013), has ruled that <b>the</b> <b>appeals</b> <b>procedure</b> for patients without capacity detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act is not compatible with Article 5 (4) of the European Convention of Human Rights. The European Court has ruled that special procedural safeguards are required to enable this cohort of patients to exercise their rights guaranteed by Article 5 (4). Conclusions: Responsible Clinicians [treating consultant psychiatrists], need to ensure that all patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act have an assessment of their capacity to apply to the tribunal. There needs to be a system in place to alert hospital managers when a patient lacks capacity to apply for a tribunal. Hospital Managers should request the Secretary of State to apply for a tribunal in these instances. Knowledge of this this ruling is relevant to informing the practice of other interdisciplinary health care professionals working with such patients...|$|E
