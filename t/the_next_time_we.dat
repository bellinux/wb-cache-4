Kyle accidentally exposes his buttocks while changing {{in his car and}} Mark Brennan charges him with indecent exposure. The fine leaves Kyle without money for rent and Jade fires him. Kate decides to help by employing him at Harold's for the day. Kyle and Kate go on another date. Kyle is blackmailed by corrupt police officer Wes Holland and he asks Brennan for help. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>Wes</b> turns up, Brennan arrests him. Kyle moves into Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) spare room and later rents the house from her. He asks Jade to move in with him and when they struggle with the rent, Brennan moves in. Kyle quits his job and sets up a handyman business, which Lou invests in. Kyle and Jade kiss at their house warming party and begin a casual relationship. When Brennan leaves, Kyle and Jade let Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le) move in, but they soon get fed up of her behaviour. Michelle leaves when Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) poses as a property inspector and tells her she needs to pay for damages to the house. Kyle invites Rhys to move in and he dates Rhys's colleague Danielle Paquette (Georgia Bolton).|$|R

40|$|Receding horizon control (RHC), {{also known}} as model {{predictive}} control (MPC), [1]–[5] is a feedback control technique that became popular in the 1980 s. With RHC, an optimization problem is solved at each time step to determine {{a plan of action}} over a fixed time horizon. The first input from this plan is applied to the system. At <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> step <b>we</b> repeat <b>the</b> planning process, solving a new optimization problem with the time horizon shifted one step forward. The optimization problem takes into account estimates of future quantities based on available information at each time step. The control policy involves feedback since real-time measurements are used to determine the control input...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContrary to the {{classical}} (time-triggered) principle that samples the system states and calculates the control signal in a periodic fashion, a self-triggered control predicts <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> at which <b>the</b> states must be sampled and the control signal updated and applied. The main advantage of self-triggered control implementation is that it eliminates the resource utilization for continuously monitoring the states. In this paper, a new self-triggered control strategy is proposed. We propose to emulate the universal event-based formula - developed in previous work - to calculate the feedback law and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> activation <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> claim that our proposal behaves better than the existing self-triggered approaches due to the universal formula properties. The study is restricted to the stabilization of linear systems. Some simulations are presented comparing the proposal with existing techniques...|$|R

30|$|Additionally, we {{analyze the}} {{effectiveness}} of incorporating video prediction results into the scheduling decisions. The prediction of videos to be serviced and the prediction of waiting times for service have recently been proposed in [17]. These prediction results, however, {{were not used to}} alter the scheduling decisions. We propose a scheduling policy, called Predictive Cost-Based Scheduling (PCS). Like MCF, PCS is cost-based, but it predicts future system state and uses the prediction results to potentially alter the scheduling decisions. It delays servicing requests at the current scheduling time (even when resource are available) if it is expected that shorter streams will be required at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> scheduling <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> present two alternative implementations of PCS.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{encoding}} {{and control}} {{strategy for the}} stabilization of switched systems with limited information, supposing the controller is given for each mode. Only the quantized output and the active mode of the plant at each sampling time are transmitted to the controller. Due to switching, the active mode of the plant may be {{different from that of}} the controller in the closed-loop system. Hence if switching occurs, the quantizer must recalculate a bounded set containing the estimation error for quantization at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> sampling <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> establish <b>the</b> global asymptotic stability under a slow-switching assumption on dwell time and average dwell time. To this end, we construct multiple discrete-time Lyapunov functions with respect to the estimated state and the size of the bounded set. ...|$|R
