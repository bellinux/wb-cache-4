40|$|For {{the past}} decade, efforts to manage in a {{sustainable}} way the once bountiful natural resources of Cambodia have been confounded by short-term commercial interests. Protection {{of the environment}} {{is seen as a}} luxury in a country where <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives</b> under the poverty line. Budget constraints and pressing social needs work against parks. This study takes a hard-nosed look at the economics of Preah Sihanoukvarman "Ream" National Park. After a year of fieldwork, an inventory of 37 hectares of mangrove forests, and more than 600 households and 1, 300 visitors interviewed, the research team draws pessimistic conclusions. Given the uncertainties surrounding long-term protected area planning, most Cambodian policy makers are likely to favor the more immediate benefits of development. Without international transfer of funds for conservation, Ream National Park will be destroyed. Local communities, whose traditional livelihoods depend on the conservation and sustainable use of the park, stand to loose most; industrial loggers and commercial fishing fleets stand to gain most from the wanton exploitation of timber and marine resources.

The data were collected in September, 1965, during few days in two Wapisiana villages (Barata and Serra da Môça), bboth not very far from Boa Vista, capital of the Federal Territory of Roraima (Brazil). The Wapsiana (Arawak) are about one thousand people living in Roraima, they areinhabitants of this brazilian area and of Guiana as well.

40|$|Researchers {{investigating}} Human Computer Interaction(HCI) {{issues in}} the domain of e-health specially emphasize the need for following a holistic framework to design interactive and user-centered mobile e-health applications. In this context, “conservative environments ” – commonly experienced in ru-ral areas of developing countries – pose a unique challenge for designing, developing and deploying e-health applica-tions. In this paper, we present a four step framework to engineer usability for conservative environments:(1) back-ground analysis, (2) design conceptualization, (3) iterative prototype implementation, and (4) usability evaluation. The main contribution of the paper is following a multifaceted integrated approach for conducting an in-context usability evaluation during the development phase of an application’s life cycle. We have evaluated the proposed framework on our project “Remote Patient Monitoring System with Fo-cus on Antenatal Care ” that aims to revamp the existing medical infrastructure of Pakistan by providing basic health care facilities to the remote village population – <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives</b> in a conservative culture – of Pakistan. The findings of our case study also validates our thesis: adopting a number of usability evaluation approaches – focus groups, heuristic based expert evaluation and field observation study – prove useful in achieving desired goals for our mobile e-health ap-plication in the conservative environments...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, India has {{witnessed}} visible, and often acrimonious, contests between global and local, modernity and tradition, {{markets and the}} State. The economic domain has seen a shift from a protected capitalist economy that tried to mix planning with a market-based economy, to a regime increasingly marked by neoliberalism and declining welfare state. This {{is a period of}} high economic growth, prosperity for some groups, and an increase in inequality levels in the country. We also witness an ongoing agrarian crisis in rural India, where <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives,</b> contributing to more than 200, 000 farm suicides in the last two decades. In the political domain, there is a distinct rightward shift with an unprecedented rise of Hindu majoritarianism that has recently culminated in the elevation of Narendra Modi to the post of Prime Minister. On the one hand, the new India is trying to be assertive as it tries to find its place as a global power and is stridently militaristic in its geopolitical interactions.

A recent report published by the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion & Public Life (on the 18 th of December, 2012) claims that the third largest 'religion' is the ‘no religion’ – {{it is estimated that}} there are 1.1 billion individuals who claim to have 'no religion' (16 percent of the world population. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives</b> in communist countries (700 million in China). Christianity is the largest religion (2.2 billion individuals comprising 32 percent of the world population) followed by Islam in second place (1.6 billion individuals comprising 23 percent of the world population). After the third ‘no religion’ denomination, the fourth is Hindu (1 billion individuals) and the fifth is Buddhism (0.5 billion). Only 14 million individuals belong to the faith of Judaism (0.02 percent of world population). Individuals with ‘no religion’ were included in a previous version of the study and are now excluded based on the comment of one of the referees. Interestingly, even individuals who claim to have ‘no religion’ report religious activities such as attending church services and praying. The Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion and Public Life (2012) also states that many of those who report a denomination of ‘no religion’ still believe in some spiritual ‘superpower’. This is why they were included in the analysis in several studies of religious performance (e.g., Aleksynska and Chiswick 2013).|$|E
40|$|Title: Information {{exchange}} with professionals in dementia decision-making: views of informal caregivers Background: Worldwide, {{there are an}} estimated 24 million people with dementia. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives</b> at home and are largely dependent of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers are increasingly involved in care decisions for persons with dementia. Barriers to make such decisions include lack of information exchange and support. This creates unnecessary stress in informal caregivers. Shared decision-making, when facilitated by professionals, can support adequate information exchange, enabling informal caregivers to make care decisions. Aim and research question: In order to gain insight into the role of professionals in information exchange, informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding exchanging information in care decisions should be examined. This insight might result in indications for adequate information exchange between informal caregivers and professionals. Method: This qualitative study was conducted using the principles of the Grounded Theory approach. The study population consisted of informal caregivers of persons with dementia from the Netherlands who were part of a dementia care network. The software Atlas. ti was used. Results: Informal caregivers’ views on professionals regarding information exchange in decision-making are depended on the nature of involvement. Professionals were considered to be either actively or passively involved. Informal caregivers were positive about information exchange of actively involved professionals. The information exchange of passively involved professionals was too often not consistent with their needs. Conclusion: The information exchange of professionals was too often not appropriate. Many decisions were discussed by informal caregivers with members of the care network, but these decisions were not indisputably based on shared decision-making. Decisions were mainly based on good sense and gut feeling. Recommendations: Improvement of expertise for professionals regarding dementia and support during the process of information exchange in decision-making, to ensure informal caregivers are equal partners in decision-making...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this study is to explore the {{consumption}} attitude of young Spanish consumers` towards eating Norwegian salmon. Another purpose is to find out the perception of the people regarding Norwegian salmon as a typical product of Norway. The role of country of origin and brand awareness on perceived quality was also taken into account. Design/Method/Approach – Theory of reasoned action is used as a framework to explore the consumers` attitude and consumption intention towards Norwegian salmon. Attitude, subjective Norm in the traditional theory is extended with perceived quality, perceived benefits, perceived risks, perceived price, perceived inconvenience and trust in regulatory control in order to explain attitude, behavioral consumption intention and consumption frequency. The role or country of origin image and brand awareness in evaluation of perceived quality is also included in the extended model. The overall model is divided into four submodels. Four regression analyses are applied to get the results. The first regression of model 1 explored the effect of country of origin image and brand awareness on perceived quality. The second regression of model 2 explored the effect of perceived quality, perceived benefits, perceived price, perceived risks, perceived inconvenience and trust in regulatory control on attitude. The third regression of model 3 explored the effect of attitude, subjective norm and consumption frequency on behavioral consumption intention. And the fourth regression of model 4 showed the effect of behavioral consumption intention on consumption frequency. Data from survey of two hundred (200) students from university of Cantabria (Spain) was used. Findings – The empirical findings shows that country of origin image and brand awareness has a significant positive association with perceived quality. In addition, perceived quality, perceived benefits, and trust in regulatory control have a significant positive effect on attitude. However, perceived inconvenience, perceived price and perceived risks have negative effect on attitude. The effect of perceived inconvenience is significant on attitude but perceived risks and perceived price showed an insignificant negative effect. Attitude, subjective norms and consumption frequency have a significant positive association with behavioral consumption intention. And the association between behavioral consumption intention and consumption frequency is also positive and significant. Hence, findings shows that the attitude of young Spanish consumers towards eating Norwegian salmon is positive and they also perceive ‘salmon’ as a typical product of Norway. Limitation of the study- A major limitation of the study is that the results are not the representative for the whole Spanish population, because of the sample size and its socio-demographic characteristics. Because of their age and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives</b> at home with their parents gives different results regarding perceived price and perceived inconvenience than perhaps consumers with other ages and lifestyles. Living in the coastal areas does not represent the attitude and consumption intention of consumers living further form the coastline. Secondly, the study involved in the exploration of consumption attitude only towards the fish species of salmon. 3 Managerial Implications- it is advised to the Norwegian seafood council (NSC) to advertise more towards the younger segment regarding country image, nutrition value cooking recipes of Norwegian salmon, emphasizing its health benefits and convenience. The public health authorities and the producers should focus on convincing consumers that salmon not just provide benefits towards health but also convince them why the fish is good and what other tangible benefits they can get from eating of Norwegian salmon other than the nutrition and omega 3 such as pleasure and joy. This can be done through marketing communications...|$|E

40|$|Der vorliegende Beitrag beschreibt die Generationenbeziehungen in ihrem Ausmass, in ihren unterstuetzenden Funktionen und mit ihren Konflikten. Darueber hinaus zeigt er, welche Moeglichkeiten der ausserfamiliaeren Generationenbeziehungen es gibt und wie sich das Miteinander der Generationen foerdern laesst. Der Beitrag ist im Einzelnen folgendermassen gegliedert: Im ersten Kapitel wird die demographische Entwicklung beschrieben. Das zweite Kapitel erklaert den Unterschied zwischen dem Verhaeltnis und der Beziehung zwischen den Generationen. Es fragt weiter, ob aus den neuartigen Altersstrukturen mit einem deutlich gewachsenen Anteil der Aelteren an der Bevoelkerung Konflikte entstehen auf der Ebene des politischen Einflusses, der sozialstaatlichen Mittelverteilung und bezueglich der Einstellungen und Wertmuster. Das dritte Kapitel beschreibt Haushaltsformen und Familienstand als Merkmale der Lebenssituation Aelterer. Da die meisten aelteren Menschen alleine leben, richtet sich das Interesse auf die Beziehungen, die zwischen den eigenstaendigen Haushalten der Generationen im Familienverband bestehen (Kapitel vier). Intergenerationelle Hilfe und Unterstuetzung werden in Kapitel fuenf skizziert und die mittlere sowie die aeltere Generation werden als Geber und Empfaenger in diesem Beziehungsnetz verortet. Insbesondere wird die Rolle des familiaeren Netzes bei der Versorgung hilfe- und pflegebeduerftiger aelterer Menschen beleuchtet. (ICD) 'Usually {{the public}} media depict intergenerational {{relationships}} as loosely bound and distant. In this view elderly people would live single and {{separated from their}} offspring, weak family ties in general would manifest themselves in a weak relationship to the elderly parents and little exchange of help and mutual support. This widespread public image is corrected by the report. In a first step the demographic development is outlined and the thesis about a coming 'war between the generations' is discussed. In a second step information about the living conditions of the elderly in different households which are important preconditions for intergenerational relationships are given. In the third part the report deals with intergenerational relationships with reference to historical new development towards overlapping lifecycles in this century. Regarding geographical distance and contacts, in the average population we cannot speak about deficits. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>lives</b> together closely. Although it is not common among elderly parents to share a household with adult children, they have regular contact. But there is a minority living in a greater distance and with rare contacts. Emotional relationships are close, especially between daughter and mother. Again, certain groups will not show this pattern. The mentioned closeness does not prevent conflicts. Social support follows a specific pattern. The generation in the middle has more exchange with own offspring and vice versa. Concerning the need for support in the older population, a spouse or a partner is of primary importance in most areas. But elderly who are widowed or living without a partner will refer to their children as the primary helpers. Most of social support is given within the family, especially by the middle generation. The report outlines the necessity for professional care services {{as well as the}} use of the German care insurance. An elaborated system of social support and medical care for elderly people exists. But regarding the impact of demographic changes, this system in its current shape is hardly capable of replacing family ties. Thus the necessity to develop intergenerational contacts and mutual help outside the family is outlined in chapter six. In a 'greying society' we need to support the contacts between generations beyond the boundaries of families. Therefore in the last chapter, the report deals with approaches to intergenerational work that aim at supporting the dialog between generations. Models in Bavaria are presented to generate the motivation for a further growth of intergenerational work.
