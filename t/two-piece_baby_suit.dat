40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the full {{realization}} of a garment embedded patient monitoring system, including wireless communication and inductive powering. The developed system is primarily intended for the continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram (ECG) of children with {{an increased risk of}} Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The sensors and the antenna are made out of textile materials. All electronics are mounted on a flexible circuit to facilitate integration in the baby's pajamas. A significant increase in the comfort of patient and nursing staff is achieved by this integration in textiles. A prototype <b>baby</b> <b>suit</b> was fabricated and successfully tested.

50|$|In early June, 2009, MorphThing added a baby application. This {{allows users}} to upload photos of {{themselves}} and someone else (privately) and instead of morphing one can easily create a MorphBaby. This will morph the two images and will also add a <b>baby</b> that best <b>suits</b> the photos to the morph. This makes for a very realistic baby morph. Members can also select a photo of themselves (privately) and a celebrity to make a MorphBaby. Only two photos are able {{to be used for}} MorphBabies, regardless of gender.|$|R
5000|$|A {{meeting between}} [...] "Jafsie" [...] and a {{representative}} of the group that claimed to be the kidnappers was eventually scheduled for late one evening at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. According to Condon, the man sounded foreign but stayed in the shadows during the conversation, and he was thus unable to get a close look at his face. The man said his name was John, and he related his story: he was a [...] "Scandinavian" [...] sailor, part of a gang of three men and two women. The baby was being held on a boat, unharmed, but would be returned only for ransom. When Condon expressed doubt that [...] "john" [...] actually had the baby, he promised some proof: the kidnapper would soon return the <b>baby's</b> sleeping <b>suit.</b> The stranger asked Condon, [...] "... would I 'burn' executed, if the package the baby were dead?" [...] When questioned further, he assured Condon that the baby was alive.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the role of sound in the presentation and representation of bodies in performance art that incorporates digital technologies. It consists of a written thesis accompanied by a portfolio with documentation of original artwork. Since the 1960 s, performance artists have explored the use of sensor technologies to register signals generated by the body and synthesize or control sound. However, both practical and theoretical approaches to biosignal sonification in this field have almost entirely focused on musical (formalist) perspectives, technological innovation, or heightening the performer’s and spectator’s awareness of their body’s physiology. Little {{attention has been paid to}} the usually conspicuous interaction between body and technological equipment and the role of the generated sound in the context of cultural critical debates regarding the performing body. The present study responds to this observation in two ways: Firstly, the written part of the study examines existing biosignal performance practices. It seeks to demonstrate that artists’ decisions on the design of sensor technology and sound synthesis or manipulation methods are often complicit in the representation of normative body types and behaviour. Drawing from a concept of the sonified body as a transgressive or ‘freak’ body, three critical perspectives on biosignal sonification in digital performance are proposed: A reading of body sonification methods from a gender-critical perspective, an inquiry in the context of Mikhail Bakhtin’s concepts of the grotesque and the classical body, and a conceptualization of the sonified body as a posthuman prosthetisized body. This part of the study serves as a framework for its second objective: the development of practical performance strategies to address and challenge cultural conventions concerning ‘the’ body’s form and role in society. This aspect of the thesis is developed in conjunction with, and further explored in, the artwork documented in the portfolio. The practical part of the study consists of three digital performance works. ELECTRODE (2011) involves an anal electrode that registers the activity of my sphincter muscle and uses this data to synthesize sound. For this work, I modified a commercially available muscle tension sensor device designed for people with faecal incontinence problems. Feedback (2010) encompasses components of a commercially available fetal Doppler sensor intended to listen to the heartbeat of unborn <b>babies.</b> <b>SUIT</b> (2009 - 2010) encompasses several performances that feature a PVC overall equipped with a loudspeaker, sensor interface and Doppler and humidity sensors...|$|R
5000|$|Exhausted by her husband’s {{extended}} absences and {{his failure}} {{to provide for the}} family, Baby's mother goes out to the market and never returns. Baby is four years old. Her father is insensitive and abusive, beating her up for inconsequential reasons like telling a school friend that there was no food in the house. He brings home one “new mother” after another never thinking about how it affects the children. Baby's intermittent spells of schooling are cut short by money shortages and domestic chaos. Her elder sister is abruptly married off because their father {{can no longer afford to}} keep her. <b>Baby</b> follows <b>suit</b> in helping cut costs of feeding another hungry mouth. At a young age of 12, her father marries her off to a man twice her age. Baby is too young to understand the significance of the preparations for her own marriage and prefers to play with her friends in the street instead. After meeting her future husband, Baby tells a friend: “It will be a good thing to be married. At least I will get to have a feast.” Even in the hours before her wedding, she writes, “I’d sing and jump about and play.” ...|$|R
