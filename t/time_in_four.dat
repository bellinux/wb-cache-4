The recording of the edition of 22 October was brought forward two hours from the usual 8.30pm start time to allow for any disruption, before being broadcast later the same night.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Wimbledon Gentlemen's singles final was the {{championship}} match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, featuring a rematch of last year's final between Djokovic and Federer.

5|$|A mid-table {{finish in}} 1970–71 meant {{that for the}} first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years Manchester City did not qualify for Europe. The {{following}} year, a fourth-placed league finish gave the club a berth in the UEFA Cup for the first time. The UEFA Cup had replaced the Fairs Cup in 1971, when control of the competition transferred to UEFA. City's debut in the competition was a short one. Drawn against a Valencia side managed by Alfredo Di Stéfano, City were bounced out in the 2nd leg at the Mestalla 3-2,despite producing a pulsating 2–2 draw at Maine Road in the 1st leg.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was {{appointed}} to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood and his teammates began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup for the second <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. Selwood's 33disposals, 11clearances, and 2goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best afield in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50games. His involvement in 46victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting effort for the most successful 50game stretch in VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50games—Selwood had been involved in 46—eclipsing Essendon's return of 46wins and 4losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that {{the fallout from the}} Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks had missed the playoffs for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, both leagues {{were dealing}} with serious {{financial}} problems. The St. Louis Blues {{were on the verge}} of bankruptcy. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E

50|$|On September 26, the Dodgers {{came from}} behind to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-4 at Pittsburgh.

5|$|Carlsen won the Vugar Gashimov Memorial in Şəmkir, Azerbaijan, played from 20–30 April. He {{played in}} the A group along with Caruana, Nakamura, Karjakin, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov and Radjabov. Carlsen started the tournament with 2/2, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura. He then drew against Karjakin, only to lose two {{games in a row}} for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, losing to Caruana with black and then with white to Radjabov. In {{the second half of the}} tournament, Carlsen scored 4/5, beating Mamedyarov and Nakamura again, and {{securing}} the tournament victory by beating Caruana in the final round, finishing with +5−2=3.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Windle retired, {{but made}} a {{comeback}} {{to compete in}} the shorter distances after being persuaded by Talbot. In 1968, Windle anchored Indiana's 880yd freestyle relay to victory at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, sealing what would be the first of six consecutive men's team titles for the university. He then competed in the Australian Championships for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. Although he did not win any individual events, he was part of New South Wales' winning quartets in the 4×100m and 4×200m freestyle relays. Windle was appointed the captain of the men's Olympic swimming team, gaining selection for the 100m and 200m freestyle events and the respective freestyle relays. He was not selected for the 1500m freestyle, ending the defence of his Olympic title before the team had reached Mexico City.|$|E
5|$|In Miami, first-ranked Maryland {{faced the}} team Tatum had coached {{prior to his}} arrival at College Park: fourth-ranked Oklahoma under former {{assistant}} Bud Wilkinson. The Sooners handed Maryland their only defeat, 0–7, but—as had happened in 1951 to the Terrapins' detriment—the final rankings were released before the bowls, and for the third <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, AP's national champion was defeated in their postseason game. However, unlike Tennessee, who retained their top-rank despite losing to Maryland in 1951, the Terrapins (10–1–0) did indeed finish with the best record, better than the Orange Bowl victor, Oklahoma (9–1–1). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game). At the same time, the Terps scored a record combined total of 298 points, a number not exceeded until 1967.|$|E
50|$|Gomis' {{form in the}} 2008-09 {{season was}} {{scrutinized}} more heavily {{than it was in}} the previous season. Despite this, Gomis successfully netted five <b>times</b> <b>in</b> 17 league appearances, and excelled with his performances in the UEFA Cup, scoring three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> games.|$|R

50|$|He was {{a member}} of his country's U-17 {{national}} team, Choe Myong-ho took part in the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship (scoring three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> games) and the AFC U-17 Championship 2006, where his side finished runners-up.|$|R
5|$|In the 2003–04 {{season he}} scored 18 goals in all {{competitions}} which, despite {{the arrival of}} new strikers Adrian Mutu and Hernán Crespo, made him top-scorer at the club for the third <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. On 27 March, his 32nd birthday, Hasselbaink came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Geremi Njitap and scored a hat-trick as Chelsea came from behind to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 5–2 at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea finished the season in second place and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League; Hasselbaink played in both legs of the semi-final defeat to AS Monaco, as Chelsea lost 5–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Ramón Calderón {{was elected}} as club {{president}} on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello {{as the new}} coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked {{at the end of}} the campaign. On 9 June 2007, Real played against Zaragoza at La Romareda. Zaragoza led Real 2–1 near the end of the match while Barcelona were also winning against Espanyol 2–1. A late Ruud van Nistelrooy equalizer followed by a last-minute Raúl Tamudo goal sprang Real Madrid's title hopes back into their favour.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{performed}} in {{public for the}} first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years in 2004, appearing with an octet at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. He was not often seen in public after this. In 2005, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded him its President's Merit Award. In 2006, Let's Get to the Nitty Gritty: The Autobiography of Horace Silver, was published by the University of California Press. A 2008 release, Live at Newport '58, from a Silver concert fifty years earlier, reached the top ten of Billboards jazz chart.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Moses was {{transferred}} from West Bromwich Albion to Manchester United for £500,000. He {{had been a}} crucial player in an Albion side that had qualified for the UEFA Cup three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> seasons with top-four finishes.|$|R
5000|$|Nonnie MacInnes won {{the award}} three <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years <b>in</b> the mid 1990s for his {{performances}} with Oban Camanachd. Even more exceptional {{was the fact}} that he was only on the winning side once of those three occasions.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, Legat was {{involved}} in a racist incident with Guinean Pablo Thiam, a teammate, in early 1999. He was immediately released, only appearing 40 <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years combined, and spent two more injury-ravaged years at FC Schalke 04, subsequently retiring.|$|R
5|$|The Florida State/Virginia Tech matchup was the 31st {{game between}} the two teams since they first met in 1955. At the time, Florida State held the {{advantage}} in wins, with a 19101 record against Virginia Tech. Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl, however, spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was favored to win by two points on Dec. 10. This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles, who hadn't finished out of {{first place in the}} ACC since joining the league in 1992, and would not participate in the national championship game for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> years. Because of this decline in stature, the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage than it would have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{were unable}} to build on their Super Bowl appearance. They ended the 2001 season 7–9 {{and out of the}} playoffs for the third <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> seasons. Collins {{continued}} his success as the team's quarterback, throwing for over 3,700 yards and 19 touchdowns, and Strahan broke the NFL record by recording 22.5 sacks In 2002, Collins had one of the best seasons of his career, throwing for over 4,000 yards, and Barber rushed for 1,386 yards and caught 69 passes for 597 yards. Rookie tight end Jeremy Shockey caught 74 passes for a total of 894yards. The team started 6–6, but made the playoffs as a wild card by winning their last four regular season games.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw Palace {{make the}} play offs {{for the third}} <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>four</b> seasons but they failed to progress to the final, losing to Watford. Palace also lost another manager, as Dowie left the club stating {{that he wanted to}} be closer to his family in Bolton. Jordan had accepted Dowie's reasons and waived a £1million compensation fee in the manager's contract. However, when Dowie was appointed as manager of Charlton Athletic Jordan pursued him through the courts, eventually settling the affair in April 2008. Former fans favourite Peter Taylor succeeded Dowie as manager for the 2006–07 season. Taylor was unsuccessful in getting Palace promoted, and was replaced by Neil Warnock two months into the 2007–08 season. Warnock guided the team to the 2008 Football League Championship play-offs where they lost in the semi-finals to Bristol City. Palace followed this with a fifteenth-place finish the next season.|$|E
