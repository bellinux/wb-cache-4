40|$|Individuals with agrammatic Broca’s aphasia {{experience}} difficulty when <b>processing</b> reversible <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences.</b> Different accounts {{have been}} proposed to explain this phenomenon. The Trace Deletion account (Grodzinsky, 1995, 2000, 2006) attributes this deficit to an impairment in syntactic representations, whereas others (e. g., Caplan, Waters, Dede, Michaud, & Reddy, 2007; Haarmann, Just, & Carpenter, 1997) propose that the underlying structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by processing deficits, such as slow lexical activation, reduction in memory resources, slowed processing and/or intermittent deficiency, among others. We test the claims of two processing accounts, slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, and {{two versions of the}} Trace Deletion Hypothesis (TDH), in a computational framework for sentence processing (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005) implemented in ACT-R (Anderson, Byrne, Douglass, Lebiere, & Qin, 2004). The assumption of slowed processing is operationalized as slow procedural memory, so that each processing action is performed slower than normal, and intermittent deficiency as extra noise in the procedural memory, so that the parsing steps are more noisy than normal. We operationalize the TDH as an absence of trace information in the parse tree. To test the prediction...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed at}} further elucidating whether aphasic patients' {{difficulties}} in understanding <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentence</b> structures, such as Passive or Object-Verb-Subject sentences, {{can be attributed}} to impaired morphosyntactic cue recognition, and to problems in integrating competing interpretations. A sentence-picture matching task with canonical and <b>non-canonical</b> spoken <b>sentences</b> was performed using concurrent eye tracking. Accuracy, reaction time, and eye tracking data (fixations) of 50 healthy subjects and 12 aphasic patients were analysed. Patients showed increased error rates and reaction times, as well as delayed fixation preferences for target pictures in <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences.</b> Patients' fixation patterns differed from healthy controls and revealed deficits in recognizing and immediately integrating morphosyntactic cues.

40|$|Post-transcriptional, RNA-based {{regulation}} {{is a major}} contributor to alterations in gene expression, and γ-herpesviruses interface with the host RNA targeting machinery in a variety of ways. Several of these interactions involve coordination with cellular ribonucleases, for example <b>to</b> direct <b>non-canonical</b> <b>processing</b> of viral microRNAs or widespread degradation of cellular messenger RNAs. Conversely, select viral transcripts use both cis-acting and trans-acting mechanisms to evade degradation. The diversity of mechanisms used by these viruses to both engage and escape the cellular RNA decay machinery underscores the influence these pathways exert on cellular and viral gene expression.

40|$|Discourse context {{has been}} argued {{to be the main}} factor {{responsible}} for increased <b>processing</b> difficulty in <b>non-canonical</b> order sentences: if appropriate discourse context is provided (the argument goes) both canonical and <b>non-canonical</b> order <b>sentences</b> are equally easy to process.

30|$|However, it {{is crucial}} {{to point out that the}} subject of a {{sentence}} is also typically animate (Branigan et al. 2008), and the constraint on the SOV reading might arise from the lack of a contrast in the animacy of the arguments.

Qu (1994) further argues that when two preverbal nouns are equally likely to be the thematic agent, the <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentence</b> is disambiguated as OSV, which is the ‘default option’.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{communicate}} efficiently, speakers typically link their utterances to {{the discourse}} environment and adapt their utterances to the listener‘s discourse representation. Information structure describes how linguistic information is packaged within a discourse to optimize information transfer. The present study investigates {{the nature and}} time course of context integration (i. e., aboutness topic vs. neutral context) on the comprehension of German declarative sentences with either subject-before-object (SO) or object-before-subject (OS) word order using offline comprehensibility judgments and online event-related potentials (ERPs). Comprehensibility judgments revealed that the topic context selectively facilitated comprehension of stories containing OS (i. e., <b>non-canonical)</b> <b>sentences.</b> In the ERPs, the topic context effect was reflected in a less pronounced late positivity at the sentence-initial object. In line with the Syntax-Discourse Model, we argue that these context-induced effects are attributable <b>to</b> reduced <b>processing</b> costs for updating the current discourse model.

40|$|Treatment of {{sentence}} production {{deficits in}} aphasia has been approached from different perspectives, {{depending on the}} etiology of the production deficit. For example, one approach has been to improve the mapping of surface structures to the underlying meaning (e. g., Schwartz, Saffran, Fink, Myers & Martin, 1994). Other interventions have directly targeted lexicalsemantic processing (Marshall, Pring & Chiat, 1998), verb retrieval (e. g., Mitchum, Haendiges & Berndt), and comprehension of <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentence</b> structures such as passive forms, whquestions, or center-embedded clauses (Thompson, Shapiro & Roberts, 1993).

30|$|First, let us {{examine the}} results for the SVO {{sentences}}. As shown in Fig.  3 and Table  4, the point-estimated probabilities of the SVO sentences being judged grammatical were above 99 % for both groups under both animacy conditions, with a slight variance in their 95 % CIs. There was no significant between-group difference for the SVO sentences in either animacy condition (estimated younger – older group difference under the [+animacy contrast] condition 0.21, 95 % CI [−[*] 1.05, 1.47], z[*]=[*] 0.33, p[*]=[*]. 742; under the [−animacy contrast] condition 1.46, [−[*] 0.52, 3.45], z[*]=[*] 1.45, p[*]=[*]. 147).

We postulate that there might not exist a default interpretation for <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> when the animacy of the two nouns is perfectly uniform, and this in turn would cause difficulties in analysing the syntactic and thematic roles in AAV strings.

Overall, 652 known mature miRNAs were detected, of which 21 were highly expressed, thus being responsible of most of miRNA-mediated gene repression. microRNA putative targets were enriched in specific signaling pathways, providing information about cell activities under massive post-transcriptional regulation. The majority of miRNAs were mixtures of sequence variants, called isomiRs, mainly due <b>to</b> alternative, <b>non-canonical</b> <b>processing</b> of hairpin precursors. We also identified 78 novel miRNAs (miRNA*) derived from known hairpin precursors. Both major and minor (*) form of miRNAs were expressed concurrently from half of expressed hairpins, highlighting the relevance of miRNA* and the complexity of strand selection bias regulation. Finally, we discovered that SET 2 cells express a number of miRNA-offset RNAs (moRNAs), short RNAs derived from genomic regions flanking mature miRNAs. We provide novel data about the possible origin of moRNAs, while their functional role remains to be elucidated.

40|$|Background: Studies {{devoted to}} {{improving}} past tense verb production in Broca's aphasic patients are sparse. Of the existing studies few have produced generalised improvement on untreated verbs, although one study has shown improvement on untreated regular, but not irregular, verbs (Weinrich, Boser, and McCall, 1999). Within a single mechanism account of past tense verb production (McClelland and Patterson, 2002 a, 2002 b), irregular verbs fall into clusters that share similar transformations from their stem to past tense. No studies {{to our knowledge}} have explored whether strengthening irregular verb representations during rehabilitation can support production on untreated irregulars from the same irregular clusters. Aims: The aim of the current paper was to test the single mechanism claim that generalised improvement can be directed via irregular verb clusters in a Broca's aphasic participant (DS). We treated past tense verb production in sentences by using a mapping therapy, {{with the aim of}} maximising improved production of past tense verbs at both the single word and sentence level. Methods and Procedures: The study used a thematic mapping procedure requiring DS first to describe what was happening in a picture with two characters twice, beginning with different characters each time. Two thematic questions followed and DS was asked to produce the canonical and <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> again. <b>Non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> required past tense verb production. Pre- and post-treatment baselines were administered to test gains in sentence production, sentence comprehension, and verb production. Generalised verb production was assessed using three untreated sets: regular verbs, irregular verbs from the same "clusters" as treated items, and irregulars from other verb clusters. Outcomes and Results: Generalised improvements were seen in the production of <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences.</b> Regular and irregular past tense verb production also improved, in both single word and sentence production modalities. There was significant generalised improvement to the untreated regular verb set. Interestingly, the improvement on treated irregular verbs generalised only to untreated irregulars from the same clusters as treated verbs. Conclusions: The findings suggest that past tense verb production can be improved by promoting mapping between semantic and syntactic levels of sentence <b>processing.</b> The generalisation <b>to</b> untreated verbs with similar transformations from their stem to their past tense is promising from a clinical standpoint, suggesting that generalisation may be directed in this way. Our findings also demonstrate how rehabilitation studies can contribute to the current theoretical debate between competing models of past tense verb production.

30|$|Prior {{theoretical}} and experimental work {{has demonstrated that}} the subject-object-verb (SOV) word order is more restricted {{and more difficult to}} process than the object-subject-verb (OSV) word order in Chinese. However, few studies have investigated the actual acceptability of non-canonical, verb-final word orders among native speakers. In this study, we conducted a paper-based survey with a group of younger adults and a group of older adults. <b>Non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> with and without animacy contrasts were tested with three tasks: acceptability judgement, grammaticality judgement, and subject selection. Our results have two main implications. First, contrary to previous studies, the results suggested that animate-animate-verb (AAV) sentences generally have very poor acceptability, and they may be mostly regarded as uninterpretable. Second, and importantly, we found that while a preference for OSV over SOV was observed in younger adults, it was not evident in older adults. This suggests that the preference for the OSV word order might be modulated by the factor of age.|$|R
40|$|Background: Formal {{linguistic}} {{properties of}} sentencesÐboth lexical, i. e., argument struc-ture, and syntactic, i. e., movementÐas {{well as what}} is known about normal and disordered sentence processing and production, were considered in the development of Treatment of Underlying Forms (TUF), a linguistic approach to treatment of sentence deficits in patients with agrammatic aphasia. TUF is focused on complex, <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentence</b> structures and operates on the premise that training underlying, abstract, properties of language will allow for effective generalisation to untrained structures that share similar linguistic properties, particularly those of lesser complexity.

For <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences,</b> if decisions on the subject were made solely based on the animacy contrast, then there should be no significant difference between {{the decision}} probabilities of the ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ sentences, since they only swapped the positions of the two nouns. The moderately lower decision probability for the ‘SOV’ sentences in the younger group might be an indication that the group has a preference for the OSV word order. As a consequence, a small fraction of the responses might have chosen the ‘cannot decide’ option because these responses had considered SOV as just uninterpretable. In the older group, on the other hand, there was no significant difference among the decision probabilities for the SOV, ‘SOV’, and ‘OSV’ sentences (estimated SVO – ‘SOV’ difference 2.42, [−[*] 1.40, 6.25], z[*]=[*] 1.49, p. adj[*]=[*]. 297; estimated SVO – ‘OSV’ difference 1.16, [−[*] 2.72, 5.05], z[*]=[*] 0.70, p. adj[*]=[*]. 763; and estimated ‘SOV’ – ‘OSV’ difference −[*] 1.26, [−[*] 4.03, 1.51], z[*]=[*][*]−[*] 1.07, p. adj[*]=[*]. 533).|$|R

30|$|The animacy of nouns has {{consistently}} {{been demonstrated to}} {{play a significant role}} in the interpretation of <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences.</b> Studies based on the Competition Model (Bates and MacWhinney 1981) have found that in Chinese, when a contrast of animacy in the preverbal nouns is displayed, there is an overwhelming tendency for the animate noun to be identified as the subject and the inanimate noun to be identified as the object (Miao 1981; Li et al. 1992; Li et al. 1993). These studies have measured the percentage of the first noun being chosen as the agent of the sentence; we will refer to this as the ‘NP 1 percentage’. While the NP 1 percentage indicates the likelihood of the SOV interpretation, the complement of the NP 1 percentage (i.e., the percentage of the second noun being chosen as the agent) indicates the likelihood of the OSV interpretation. In Miao (1981), animate-inanimate-verb (AIV) strings were interpreted as SOV 85.4 % of the time, and inanimate-animate-verb (IAV) strings were interpreted as OSV 85.4 % of the time too.

However, few studies have considered that the preference for a particular word order might systematically vary with certain individual factors. We found that while a bold advantage of OSV over SOV existed in the younger group, it had ceased to be visible in the older group. Although uncontrolled factors such as the difference of educational backgrounds between the two groups 3 might play a role, we think it is less likely because the stimuli in this study are very simple, and <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> with bare objects are more frequent in spoken Chinese (Sun and Givón 1985). Another concern might be the fact that the participants in the younger group were also learners of Japanese with JLPT N 1 level (the highly proficient level). However, no evidence for L 2 influence was found in the present study because SOV is far more frequent than OSV in Japanese, with a reported SOV:OSV ratio of 17 : 1 (Kuno 1978). If the younger group’s perception of word orders in Chinese were influenced by Japanese, higher acceptability for the AIV (SOV) strings should be observed, which as shown by our data is not true. Judging from the above, we consider this difference to be age-related.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of language comprehension abilities in childhood {{is closely related}} to the maturation of the brain, especially the ability to process syntactically complex sentences. Recent studies proposed that the fronto-temporal connection within left perisylvian regions, supporting the processing of syntactically complex sentences, is still immature at preschool age. In the current study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from typically developing 5 -year-old children and adults to shed further light on the brain functional development. Children additionally performed a behavioral syntactic comprehension test outside the scanner. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations was analyzed in order to identify the functional correlation networks of language-relevant brain regions. Results showed an intrahemispheric correlation between left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in adults, whereas an interhemispheric correlation between left IFG and its right-hemispheric homolog was predominant in children. Correlation analysis between resting-state functional connectivity and sentence processing performance in 5 -year-olds revealed that local connectivity within the left IFG is associated with competence of processing syntactically simple canonical sentences, while long-range connectivity between IFG and pSTS in left hemisphere is associated with competence of processing syntactically relatively more complex <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences.</b> The present developmental data suggest that a selective left fronto-temporal connectivity network for processing complex syntax is already in functional connection at the age of 5 years when measured in a non-task situation. The correlational findings provide new insight into the relationship between intrinsic functional connectivity and syntactic language abilities in preschool children...|$|R

In this paper we {{add to the}} relatively sparse previous work on how sentence comprehension abilities {{are influenced by the}} nature of the assessment task. Aims: Our aims are: (1) to compare linguistic performance across sentence-picture matching, enactment, and truth-value judgement tasks; (2) to investigate the impact of pictorial stimuli on syntactic comprehension. Methods Procedures: We tested a group of 10 aphasic speakers (3 with fluent and 7 with non-fluent aphasia) in three tasks (Experiment 1) : (i) sentence-picture matching with four pictures, (ii) sentence-picture matching with two pictures, and (iii) enactment. A further task of truth-value judgement was given to a subgroup of those speakers (n= 5, Experiment 2). Similar sentence types across all tasks were used and included canonical (actives, subject clefts) and non-canonical (passives, object clefts) sentences. We undertook two types of analyses: (a) we compared canonical and <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> in each task; (b) we compared performance between (i) actives and passives, (ii) subject and object clefts in each task. We examined the results of all participants as a group and as case-series. Outcomes Results: Several task effects emerged. Overall, the two-picture sentence-picture matching and enactment tasks were more discriminating than the four-picture condition. Group performance in the truth-value judgement task was similar to two-picture sentence-picture matching and enactment.

30|$|While the {{configuration}} of animacy (i.e., AIV or IAV) powerfully shifts the interpretation of <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences,</b> {{it is not the}} only force. In parallel to the theoretical studies that argued that SOV is more restricted than OSV, online sentence processing studies have suggested that SOV is also more difficult to process than OSV. An online experiment was reported in Li et al. (1992) as well as in Li et al. (1993). In this experiment, participants were given a maximum of 3 s to choose the agent of a sentence; the reaction time for choices was measured in addition to the NP 1 percentage. A slight asymmetry in the interpretation of AIV and IAV strings was discovered in the results. According to the NP 1 percentage reported in Li et al. (1993), 98 % of the IAV strings were interpreted as OSV; however, only 84 % of the AIV strings were interpreted as SOV. The results suggested that under time pressure, a SOV word order disadvantage might exist. This factor might have caused a small portion of the responses to AIV strings to favour the OSV interpretation, despite the fact that there is a mismatch of the typical argument animacy in the OSV-interpreted AIV strings. Furthermore, according to Li et al. (1992) and Li et al. (1993), on average, it takes a longer time to decide the subject of AIV strings; the mean reaction time for the AIV strings (2162  ms) was statistically significantly longer than that for the IAV strings (1958  ms). Recent neurolinguistic studies also confirmed that there is a structural preference for OSV. In the ERP (event-related potential) study reported in Wang et al. (2012) and Wang 王路明 (2015), AIV strings with SOV readings elicited statistically significantly greater anterior negativity when compared to IAV sentences with OSV readings in the 450 – 700  ms time window post-verb onset, indicating that the SOV sentences are more difficult to process.|$|R

For AAV strings (the ‘SOV’ and ‘OSV’ strings under the [−animacy contrast] condition), where no animacy contrast exists, theoretical studies such as Hou (1979), Lu (1994), and Qu (1994) have made strong claims that OSV is the sole interpretation. Nevertheless, the experimental studies of Miao (1981), Li et al. (1992), and Li et al. (1993) have shown that the OSV interpretation of AAV strings is far less dominant than expected. More interestingly, their results in fact contradicted each other, with Miao (1981) suggesting a SOV preference and Li et al. (1992) and Li et al. (1993) suggesting an OSV preference. We postulated that, contrary to previous studies, there might not exist a default interpretation for <b>non-canonical</b> <b>sentences</b> when the animacy of the two nouns are perfectly uniform, such as the AAV strings in the present study. Our results have supported this hypothesis. AAV strings were the only case that the decision probability was estimated to be below 21 %, while other cases all had the decision probability above 95 %. Even for the responses where decisions on the subject were made, a great level of inconsistency existed in both groups, rendering it impossible to infer any structural preference. In addition, AAV strings are generally regarded as unacceptable. In both groups, the acceptability of AAV strings was estimated to be between 2 and 3, which is significantly below the neutral score of 4. And it is well beyond the chance level that AAV strings would be judged as ungrammatical. The possibility of AAV strings being judged as grammatical was estimated to be below 11 %. Because the decision probability was considerably low for AAV strings, the poor acceptability of AAV strings should be a direct result of their uninterpretable status.|$|R
