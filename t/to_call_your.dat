500|$|The episode has {{received}} largely positive reviews from television critics. Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his fourth favorite {{episode of the}} first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Small Potatoes" [...] an A, saying that it [...] "isn’t the very best X-Files episode (though it’s certainly up there), but it’s perhaps the easiest episode <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>your</b> “favorite,” the most approachable episode, if you will" [...] and that while Gilligan penned better X-Files installments later, [...] "he’s never written one as effortlessly playful and inventive as this one. VanDerWerff later called the episode one of the [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] and named it [...] "Gilligan’s finest comedic achievement". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode was a wonderful respite from the dark material of the season's character arcs, taking a humorous look at Mulder and his complete lack of a life. Gilligan channels Darin Morgan in many scenes, {{especially when it comes}} to making scathing observations about Mulder through the soft stick of humor." [...] Furthermore, he praised Duchovny, saying that his [...] "nuanced performance" [...] was [...] "easily one of his best." [...] Topless Robot named [...] "Small Potatoes" [...] the eighth funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the eighth best episode of the series. The episode is popular with fans, specifically for the scene where Eddie, who has changed into Mulder, tries to seduce Scully in her apartment. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five and wrote that [...] "this is what Vince Gilligan has been working towards all season." [...] The two praised Gilligan's writing, applauding his decision to critically examine Mulder rather than merely tell jokes. Furthermore, the two commended the acting of Morgan, calling his casting [...] "apt". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a rave review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four. She described it as a [...] "four course meal of comic riches" [...] and praised the writing style of Giligan, calling him [...] "the believer who writes from inside the characters' heads".|$|E
2500|$|Reform {{movements}} {{for treatment}} {{of the mentally ill}} were related in this period to other progressive causes: abolitionism, temperance, and voter reforms. After returning to America, in 1840-41 Dix conducted a statewide investigation of care for the mentally ill poor in Massachusetts. [...] In most cases, towns contracted with local individuals to care for mentally ill people who could not care for themselves and lacked family/friends to do so. Unregulated and underfunded, this system resulted in widespread abuse. Dix published the results in a fiery report, a Memorial, to the state legislature. [...] "I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>your</b> attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience." [...] Her lobbying resulted in a bill to expand the state's mental hospital in Worcester.|$|E

My belief is, {{that these}} men are dangerous—my belief is, that they are traitors in intent already, and if {{occasion}} offers, they will be traitors in fact. You may prosecute them—you may convict them; but depend upon it, my Lords, it is neither just to them, nor safe for yourselves, to allow such language to be indulged in. I believe, because I have this strong persuasion of the earnestness and honesty of these men, that it is my duty <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>your</b> Lordships' attention to the first number of this paper, called The United Irishman, which is intended to produce an excitement leading to rebellion, for the purpose of showing you the language held forth, and the object avowed by these men, to whom {{a large portion of the}} people of Ireland look up with confidence, and for the purpose of asking her Majesty's Government if this paper has come under their consideration, and if so, whether the Law Officers in Ireland have been consulted, and if it is the intention of the Government to take any notice of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact of}} the coordinated action was {{generally}} considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was [...] "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," [...] further adding [...] "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>your</b> congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people. [...] If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share your vision of what law stands for. [...] That's why the SOPA protests were so effective. They converted an argument about justice into real-world political power.") ...|$|E
