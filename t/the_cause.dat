Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine to be <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of {{an epidemic of}} colic.

As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the swell behavior. It was suggested that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the swell, as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as <b>the</b> <b>cause,</b> in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
