5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they should look like.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> supplements agricultural income.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a search for the {{principles}} of production control. The search starts from the Last Planner 4 system, develops its principles, functions and methods, then explores their applicability to designing and making, the primary <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> involved in project production systems. What differences in these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> make a difference for control? What adaptations of principles, functions or methods and tools are needed for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work?</b> The authors tentatively propose that the principles and functions derived from Last Planner are applicable to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> involved in project production systems, and that methods now in use can be successfully adapted for those <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The paper concludes with a description of needed research...|$|R

25|$|A {{treatise}} On Sense Perception (Περὶ αἰσθήσεων) and its objects {{is important}} for {{a knowledge of the}} doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by Priscian of Lydia in the sixth century.

25|$|Most {{young women}} took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before {{the growth of}} high schools after 1900, most women left school after the 8th grade at about age 15. Ciani (2005) shows that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> they did {{reflected}} their ethnicity and marital status. Black mothers were often day labors, usually as domestic servants, because other opportunities were limited. Most mothers receiving pensions were white and sought work only when necessary.|$|E

25|$|Friedan {{asserted}} {{that women are}} as capable as men for any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> or any career path against arguments to the contrary by the mass media, educators and psychologists. The restrictions of the 1950s, and the trapped, imprisoned feeling of many women forced into these roles, spoke to American women who soon began attending consciousness-raising sessions and lobbying for the reform of oppressive laws and social views that restricted women.|$|E
25|$|Child labour laws in Australia {{differ from}} state to state. Generally, {{children}} are allowed to work at any age, but restrictions exist for children under 15 years of age. These restrictions apply to work hours and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that children can perform. In all states, children are obliged to attend school until a minimum leaving age, 15 years of age in all states except Tasmania and Queensland where the leaving age is 17.|$|E
25|$|In May, {{work was}} {{completed}} on rebuilding {{the bodies of}} three cars, and {{a considerable number of}} others required to be fitted with steel braces.

25|$|During most of {{the colonial}} period, {{ceramics}} in Mexico State were mostly produced for self consumption. Ceramics became a fusion of Spanish and indigenous techniques and designs. It remained so until {{the first half of}} the 20th century, when decorative and even luxurious pieces began to be produced. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is typified by the tree of life, especially those that are not religious in function. These non-religious trees have themes such as death or spring.|$|E
25|$|Examples of inlay {{have been}} found at several sites, using {{materials}} such as nacre (mother of pearl), white and coloured limestone, lapis lazuli and marble. Bitumen was used to attach the inlay in wooden frames, but these have not survived in the archaeological record. The inlay-panels usually showed mythological or historical scenes. Like bas-reliefs, these panels allow the reconstruction of early forms of narrative art. However, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{seems to have been}} abandoned in subsequent periods.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has {{a number}} of habitat {{conservation}} programs in effect which includes lands traditionally inhabited by the Mission blue butterfly. A recovery plan, drawn up by the USFWS in 1984, outlined the need to protect Mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, off-highway vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants. An example of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> being done by governmental and citizen agencies {{can be found in the}} Marin Headlands at Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities, as well as damaging existing ones.|$|E
25|$|Thus, Kumar {{sees the}} task of {{scholars}} of media and culture as twofold: “to explain and critique the state of culture and society, and then to act upon the world to change it. In taking up this challenge, classical Marxism {{as a guide to}} action has much to offer” (85). In addition, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is possible according to Kumar due to the contradictory nature of media: “Media texts are contradictory, as all reality is contradictory. And contradiction allows for change within the totality of social relations. This change is the product of human beings resisting their conditions of oppression and exploitation” (p.84).|$|E
25|$|Harold Le Druillenec, {{brother of}} Louisa May Gould, {{was arrested on}} 5 June 1944 for trying to help an escaped Russian {{prisoner}} of war and having a radio, his sentence took him to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp for ten months {{and he was the}} only British survivor from that camp. He commented that: All my time here was spent in heaving dead bodies into the mass graves kindly dug for us by 'outside workers' for we no longer had the strength for that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> which, fortunately, must have been observed by the camp authorities. Jungle law reigned among the prisoners; at night you killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.|$|E

25|$|The church {{houses a}} small {{collection}} of religious objects (sculpture and reliquaries), about 3 dozen {{examples from the}} 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, some of which come from the Carmelite Convent of São José, and from two shrines elsewhere in town. Among these objects is a silver censer, and a carved image of the Christ Child. The censer, {{in the shape of}} a boat, is still used today during the most solemn ceremonies. Its profusion of ornamentation with volutes, acanthus leaves, seraphim heads, etc. is characteristic of the Baroque period of the first half of the 18th century. There is no information about its creator, but it was probably one of the Algarve artists well known for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} all railway contracts, {{the price was}} {{calculated}} by multiplying the quantity of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> required by the quoted price and summing up the individual amounts. If the survey was altered to require more excavation, the government paid for the extra at the schedule rate. The unstable nature of the terrain in the second section meant that the slopes of cuttings and banks had to be reduced. As Robb had to remove {{five times as much}} material as originally estimated for cuttings and tunnels, he was eventually paid £880,406. He claimed a further £262,311, but only received £20,807 of this after arbitration. With rails and other costs, the second section cost the Queensland Government £1,007,857; the most expensive line in Queensland.|$|E
25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to be done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, {{and there is some}} method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches {{is the way in which}} the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
