25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought â€” let's just make one album.|$|E

500|$|Parliament {{repealed}} the Townshend Acts in 1770. Washington {{regarded the}} passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as [...] "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges". He told friend Bryan Fairfax, [...] "I think the Parliament of Great Britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent than I have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hands into yours for money." [...] He also said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny [...] "till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{began writing}} Irene around 1726 {{when he first}} began to work in his father's {{bookshop}}. While in the bookshop he befriended Gilbert Walmesley, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court of Lichfield. Johnson would discuss Irene with Walmesley, and read him {{some of the early}} drafts. At one point, Walmesley told Johnson that [...] "he was making Irene suffer so much {{in the first part of}} the play that there would be nothing left for her to suffer in the later part". Johnson joked that there was [...] "enough in reserve... I intend <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> heroine into the ecclesiastical court of Lichfield which will fill up the utmost measure of human calamity".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Wintour {{began making}} more media appearances. On a 60 Minutes profile, {{she said she}} would not retire. [...] "To me this is a really {{interesting}} time to be in this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> best foot forward and lead us into a different time." [...] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E

500|$|In August 2010, cancer {{survivor}} Cathy Bossi, an on-duty flight attendant for U.S. Airways, was passing through security screening at Charlotte Douglas International Airport {{on the way}} to her next flight. Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. [...] "The T.S.A. Agent told me <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> I.D. on my back," [...] she said. [...] "When I got out of there the agent said because my I.D. was on my back, I had to go to a personal screening area." [...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast. Their action violated TSA guidelines, which state that agents do not need to touch or inspect a mastectomy prosthetic.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kidzworld, Rihanna explained the lyrical content of the song, saying: [...] "It's just language that we speak in Barbados. It's broken English. Pon is on, de means the, so it's just basically telling the DJ <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> song on the replay." [...] Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic [...] wrote about the song's composition and musical influences, [...] " [...] is driven by booming dancehall-lite beats and a reggae vocal cadence (and title spelling), it's a simple dance-pop song at its core, with standard English-language singing {{as well as a}} can't-miss singalong hook." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone also commented on the song's composition and concurred with Birchmeier's opinions of the song, writing that the song is [...] "a poppy piece of dancehall reggae with slapping, syncopated beats recalling big-band jazz".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E

500|$|Keith Downing {{described}} Burge as [...] "aggressive" [...] {{and that}} he is [...] "technically good and has a good frame". After arriving at Port Vale in June 2011, Vale manager Micky Adams stated, [...] "Ryan is a creative central midfielder and will bring plenty of quality on the ball, but he is also a very hard-working individual". Neil Duncanson, the Glenn Hoddle Academy's commercial director said: [...] "Ryan is very strong, powerful and suited to the front of a diamond in central midfield. He's a creative player who can take an excellent dead ball". Burge has said of himself that [...] "I'm a midfield player who likes <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> foot in, as well as to get on the ball and create things. I try to be an all-round midfield player and do a bit of everything".|$|E
500|$|The {{ideas for}} [...] "One More Day" [...] {{began to develop}} almost two years before its release, at one of Marvel's {{creative}} summits for creators and editors. Quesada, Straczynski, Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Jeph Loeb, Tom Brevoort and Axel Alonso developed the concept between them, and Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott added more at the next summit. [...] "One More Day" [...] was announced as the concluding storyline of Straczynski's run on Amazing Spider-Man in early 2007, and Quesada was named as the artist for the storyline. Although Quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor-in-chief, he felt compelled to do the art for One More Day because he felt {{very close to the}} story, and because since he had been talking about the project for so long, he felt he [...] "needed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> money where my mouth is." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest on his radio program On Air With Ryan Seacrest, Gaga described [...] "Hair" [...] as an up-tempo club record, with Bruce Springsteen overtones to it. She also revealed the involvement of Clarence Clemons playing sax on the record. Other influences included metal bands like Kiss and Iron Maiden on the melody. She revealed some of {{the lines of the}} song on Seacrest's show, [...] "This is my prayer, that I'll die living just as free as my hair", adding that the composition of [...] "Hair" [...] was interesting since it was juxtaposing saxophone with a dance record. In {{an interview}} with radio station Z-100 she added, [...] "Some of those themes are explored more on this album. <b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> money where my mouth is." [...] Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was the music of E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen; to her they represented a different genre of music, at the same time encompassing all the different elements of it. She ultimately decided to ask Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument.|$|E
500|$|The {{short film}} was {{produced}} by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but it was just such a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> name on that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh. [...] "City of Angels" [...] marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track [...] "Hurricane" [...] (2010).|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E

500|$|Referring to [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic", Skaff {{said that}} the song's titleâ€”a {{reference}} to Tails and Sonic from the video game seriesâ€”had [...] "really came out of nowhere." [...] McKinnon said the song is a [...] "more personal song [...] It discusses how the choices I've made <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> best foot forward in my career, in a sense, have really done damage to my personal life." [...] Both [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] and [...] "Out of Time" [...] talk about [...] "how I feel like I'm doing what I want with my life, but I think, [...] "Wow, I just did something that really affected me."" [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person." [...] On being asked whether he knew it would be the final song on the album, McKinnon said [...] "It just felt right [...] seemed like a good ending".|$|E
500|$|Schneider {{began the}} year as the team's {{starting}} goaltender. In his first game against the Anaheim Ducks, Schneider allowed five goals on 14 shots and was pulled midway through the second period. When Luongo entered the game {{he was given a}} standing ovation from the crowd. Luongo gave up another two goals as the Canucks lost 7â€“3. In the post-game interview, Schneider took the blame for the loss, saying, [...] "It was unacceptable to play that way and <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> team in that situation and not even {{give them a chance to}} win." [...] He also stated he would work hard to fix the mistakes. While Luongo said of this ovation that it was [...] "a fun moment." [...] The situation quickly led to a goalie controversy. Luongo made the start the following night against the Edmonton Oilers. According to Vigneault, he had already determined the starting assignments for the opening two games, and Schneider did not factor into Luongo's start. In the game, Luongo allowed two goals after Vancouver had taken a 2â€“0 lead. The Canucks lost the game 3â€“2 in a shootout. Luongo failed to stop either of the two shooters he faced, while Vancouver did not score. After losing their first two games, Vancouver added to their forward depth recalling Jordan Schroeder from the AHL and assigning Jim Vandermeer to the Wolves. Schroeder took over the second line duties after Andrew Ebbett went pointless in the first two contests.|$|E
500|$|In June 2002, {{cast members}} from Holby City and Casualty competed against the EastEnders cast {{for the first}} Sport Relief fundraiser, in a segment dubbed [...] "Sport in the Square". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay. The {{competition}} was televised on BBC One, and the event as a whole raised Â£10million. In October 2003, BBC One aired a [...] "Kenyon Confronts" [...] documentary by Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the Holby City cast in specially commissioned scenes. March 2004 saw the station air the documentary [...] "Making It at Holby", {{as part of a}} BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of Holby City and Casualty, from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes. Young explained his casting criteria, revealing: [...] "I try <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> head into the head of a viewer and ask: do I want to spend three years in the life of this person?" [...] 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon included a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a comical version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna. 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members.
