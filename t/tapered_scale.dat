40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effect of helical strakes on vortex induced vibrations and the lock-in phenomenon in High Mast Lighting Towers (HMLTs) is investigated. Two multi-sided <b>tapered</b> <b>scaled</b> models are clamped in place in a subsonic wind tunnel that is equipped with a hot-wire sensor and a traverse mechanism. The shedding frequency data is collected for the models with and without helically patterned strakes with the use of two different ropes. The responses of the tower models, for a Reynolds number of 44, 000, are compared and discussed under different configurations including: two directions of the model with respect to the direction of the flow, and changes in the ratio of strake height to HMLT diameter. Four major aspects of the spectrum of the hot-wire signal from the wake are studied: the vortex shedding frequency, signal strength, characteristic spectral peak area, and characteristic spectral peak width. It is observed that, for most cases, no specific method produces a decisive outcome. However, some of the results for the 12 -sided model provide supporting evidence that the vortex induced vibrations may be mitigated with the use of helical strakes. ...|$|R

Corolla apparently white. Fruit more or less ovoid, about 1 / 16 inch long, covered with prominent gradually <b>tapering</b> <b>scales</b> that are basally hollow, slightly inflated, and mostly < 1 / 16 inch long. Identification Tips: Only two species of Eryngium occur in Washington. Eryngium petiolatum occurs in southwestern Washington and the Columbia River Gorge.

40|$|Methods are {{developed}} for electromagnetic field calculations in nonuniform lossless transmission lines which support quasi-one dimensional propagation {{of a single}} baseband wave species. Approximate solutions are obtained in perturbation series for smoothly tapered lines by expanding Maxwell's equations and boundary conditions in the dimensionless parameter ƞ, given by the ratio of typical cross-section dimension {{to the length of}} the tapered section. The method emphasizes construction of a single "warped" field description rather than the local modal expansions of Schelkunoff's generalized telegraphist's equations. Expansions in Cartesian coordinates yield the traditional distributed circuit parameter equations in the lowest approximation. Correction terms appear in even powers of ƞ, and their effects are shown most clearly by calculating waveform aberrations introduced by line transitions of nominally constant characteristic impedance. Improved field descriptions in nonuniform regions are obtained by reformulating the exact equations in special nonorthogonal coordinate systems more closely related to the essential structure of the field problem. The lowest term of the ordered expansion is now exact for a uniform finite angle taper. New circuit level nonuniform line equations are obtained which reduce to the well-known forms for gradual tapers. These techniques are extended to treat tapered plate lines with curved center lines and then to give a description of coaxial lines in which the field pattern is locally dominated by the boundaries, and the electrical center line is located in the propagation region. Odd-sequence field distortion terms now appear in third and higher orders. In all the systems investigated, distributed circuit equations give results, outside the nonuniform region, that are valid to within second order terms in the <b>taper</b> <b>scale</b> parameter. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Many {{centers of}} {{population}} in the Pacific Northwest are dependent upon employment in the forest based industries. Mary of these timber dependent communities look to the public forests for their raw wood requirements. In some localities the installed capacity has outstripped the local wood supply. This necessitates reaching into other areas within the same subregion or into areas, such as the pine subregion, east of the Cascade Range. This interchange of logs between subregions creates problems, in log scaling, grading, and marketing, that are not of common knowledge nor fully understood by those affected by them. This is the problem we are concerned with in this study. A public timber sale purchased on the east-side ws partitioned into three subsales. One subsale, representative of the timber on the east slope of the Cascades, was used for a source of a log population for the model in this study. From a population of 999 -log loads a sample of 105 loads was selected. Each truck load was scaled {{by the rules of}} the east- and west-side at the same time, location, and conditions. Loads from each day of operation were included in the sample. These paired loads were analyzed using the Student’s "t” to test the null hypothesis, that no difference existed between scaling practices, at the five percent significance level for length, gross, and net volume. The hypothesis was rejected for there were significant differences between practices for all categories. There were 1514 logs in this study model with a gross volume of 705 MBF and 827 MBF for the west- and east-side practices respectively. These volumes were expressed as a ratio of. 853. Every load was examined and each log was paired by the two lengths as determined by the two scaling practices. All logs that were unpaired because of mismatched lengths were discarded. The remaining 1029 paired logs represented 68 percent of the original log count and 80 percent of the original gross volume. The gross volumes of 568 MBF and 658 MBF for the west- and eastside practices respectively were expressed as a ratio of. 864. The difference between the gross volume ratios from the original 1514 logs and the 1029 paired logs were (. 864) - (. 853) = 1. 1 percent. This 1. 1 percent was attributable to length and piece accountability. The difference between the paired logs gross volume ratio of 864 and unity was 13. 6 percent. This percentage was attributable to the differences that were a result of <b>taper</b> <b>scaling</b> on the east-side. The net/gross ratio differences between the east- and west-side scaling practices was 3. 9 percent. This was attributable to the subjective judgment of the individual scalers. The study model logs were scaled, graded, and log prices assigned to each grade. These volumes and values were weighted by log grade and species and a single value was expressed in dollars per net MBF Scribner scale for each subregion. The log value, stumpage values, and operating costs expressed in dollars per MBF were placed on an equivalent basis by dividing the operating costs and stumpage values by the total west-side/east-side net volume ratio of. 813. An additional charge was added to the operating costs for the greater haul mileage. The logs from the model were placed into both the east- and west-side markets and profit ratios were determined to be. 069 for the former and 085 for the latter. This was expressed as net dollars per MBF Scribner scale of 6. 26 for the west-side and 3. 84 for the east-side market. The highest net dollar return clearly emphasizes that marketing, grading and scaling are ranked in that order in the overall economic-mensurational picture...|$|R

In addition, the diamond tipped CNP arrays could easily be made into nano-diamond tip array electrodes by coating them with a polymer exposing only the diamond crystals. See Fig. 2 (c).

40|$|Ultra-dense mobile {{platforms}} {{have the}} potential to be a ubiquitous form of computing. From low-power voice recognition for wearables to high speed image recognition for self-driving cars, the mobile platform space has a wide range of requirements. These different area, power, and speed requirements necessitate a computing platform that is highly scalable, ultra-dense, and with the potential for low-power operation. Neural networks are currently the leading algorithms for recognition problems - taking in many inputs and correlating against learned weights, these algorithms are able to make informed decisions off of a large amount of generalized data. Neural network algorithms are facilitating the advancement of intelligent systems through highly parallel, large-scale processing of sensor inputs. These algorithms are memory intensive, reading out neuron weights for every computation. In digital implementations, total energy consumption is dominated by the amount and frequency of memory reads. Each neuron typically has between hundreds and thousands of 8 -bit synaptic weights, and a neuron layer has hundreds of neurons, resulting in thousands of weights per layer. Each weight is accessed once per neuron computation. Because these weight accesses are one time use there is little temporal locality that can be exploited to reduce the total energy consumption. Implementing state-of-the-art neural networks in ultra-dense form factors will require large energy improvements over current architectures, near 100 x to operate in battery-powered systems. Traditionally we could expect constant energy improvements through ideal constant field scaling. However, achieving 100 x reduction would take 35 process steps, as energy scales roughly at 1 /S^ 3. Recent years have seen an end to ideal constant field scaling, with supply voltage and threshold voltage <b>scaling</b> <b>tapering</b> off, providing diminishing returns. This dissertation works to address the limitations of memory accesses and energy inherent to neural networks through storing weights in on-chip non-volatile arrays and combining read-out and calculation current to amortize energy costs.

40|$|Atmospheric {{free flight}} scaled flight testing is an {{affordable}} way {{to investigate the}} dynamic properties of an aircraft, while enabling {{a wider range of}} test possibilities than a windtunnel. This research is the first step into the development of a scaled flight testing model and as such will highlighted the difficulties and discrepancies which will be faced when scaling is performed. This study has the objective of investigating the effect of scaling on the aerodynamic properties and of the flow field at the tail location, with the focus on take-off conditions. The full scale case is a regional aircraft, the ATR 72, with an unswept and slightly <b>tapered</b> wing. The <b>scaled</b> case is 14. 7 % geometric scaled The analysis of the aerodynamic properties is split between the clean wing and the wing with an additional surface {{in the form of a}} flap. The aerodynamic properties investigated were the lift, moment and drag curve, and the maximum lift coefficient. The clean wing was analysed using a quasi- 3 D analysis called Q 3 D, which is a combination of a vortex-lattice method (AVL) and a vortex panel method (XFOIL). A modification of XFOIL, called RFOIL, is used to analyse the difference in maximum lift coefficient between the airfoil of the scaled and full scale case. RFOIL is selected because of the better results near stall. The wing with flap is investigated using a vortex lattice method, in this case again AVL, where the airfoil with flap is investigated using the Euler-solver MSES. Finally the maximum lift coefficient for the wing with flap is analysed with the semi-empirical Pressure Difference Rule. The Pressure Difference Rule states that there is a ratio between the peak pressure and the trailing edge pressure, on a surface, at which maximum lift occurs. The methods are limited in their incorporation of viscous effects, the 2 D-analysis tools (XFOIL, RFOIL and MSES) only include viscous effects in the small boundary layer region. AVL does not include viscous effects directly, but only via a correction factor for the lift-curve slope. However, the results found in literature using these methods are satisfactory. An analysis of the wake field is done using methods developed by the ESDU. The wake properties of both the scaled as well as the full scale are calculated using semi-empirical models and use a simplification where to place the vortex sheet. The dimensions and velocity loss of the wake itself can be calculated using either a method by ESDU or a method by Schlichting. Results showed that both these methods provided similar solutions. The scaling of the wing proves to change the aerodynamic properties and the similarity is no longer present for all the investigated aerodynamic properties. For both the wing with and without flap this is the case. These differences are mainly due to Reynolds number effects, the Mach number effects are only minimal on the lift coefficient. Due to the limits on the selected methods the exact magnitude of the difference found can not be guaranteed, but the trends in the found differences are certain. A basis for this is found in the different boundary layer properties, the scaled wing exhibits a thicker boundary layer, leading to a decambering effect, and laminar separation bubbles are found to occur. Both the clean and wing with flap shows more outboard loading for the scaled wing. The scaled wing exhibits a thicker wake, with a larger velocity loss. The difference between the full and scaled clean wing is thus larger than the difference between the full and scaled wing with flap. The reason for difference between the full and scaled wing can be found in the increased drag (coefficient) of the scaled wing. The reason behind the larger increase in wake for the clean wing is due to the fact that the difference in drag coefficient between the full and scaled case is larger for the clean wing than for the wing with flap. An investigation to minimize the differences between the full and scaled wing is done. It is decided to change the airfoil shape. Improvements are visible for the optimized airfoil, on all the aerodynamic properties. The optimized airfoil shapes tends towards a thinner airfoil and thus an investigation into solely optimizing the thickness of the airfoil is also done. This also proves to give better results than the original airfoil, however, not as good as the shape optimized airfoils [...] This thinner profile was also investigated in the configuration with a flap, but here it proved to decrease the performance of the airfoil with flap. The difference between the full and scaled case can be reduced by an optimization. If an optimization is to be done, it must be done on the whole of configurations and flight conditions. As the next step into a development of a scaled flight test model, the exact extend of tests must be determined, only then can it be investigated how scaling affects the results of testing. No direct solutions exist to completely overcome the gap between the full and scaled aerodynamic properties of a flight testing model, however airfoil shape optimization does provide a better similarity.
