50|$|<b>The</b> <b>place</b> {{of birth}} (POB) is <b>the</b> <b>place</b> {{where a person}} was born. This place is often used in legal documents, {{together}} with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of birth is determined to be country that currently has sovereignty over <b>the</b> actual <b>place</b> of birth regardless of when the birth actually occurred. <b>The</b> <b>place</b> of birth is not necessarily <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where <b>the</b> parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that <b>place</b> is <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that {{the birth of the}} new baby is registered in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of birth.|$|R

5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} that the hospital (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and <b>the</b> <b>places</b> of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned {{the management of the}} hospital by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{were found}} during {{fieldwork}} in northwestern Madagascar {{that started in}} 2001. The species was described in a 2010 paper by Pierre Mein and colleagues, together with another extinct rodent, Nesomys narindaensis. The specific name, mahajambaensis, refers to Mahajamba Bay, which is close to <b>the</b> <b>places</b> where the species has been found. It {{is placed in the}} genus Brachytarsomys, together with two larger living species, B.albicauda and B.villosa. Brachytarsomys is classified in the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy is}} mainly based on {{agriculture}} and this, along with tourism, {{has contributed to}} the rural and seaside character of the Riding. These aspects are also reflected in <b>the</b> <b>places</b> of interest to visitors and major landmarks, which include historic buildings, nature reserves and the Yorkshire Wolds Way long-distance footpath. The open and maritime aspects and lack of major urban developments have also led to the county being allocated relatively high targets for the generation of energy from renewable sources.|$|E

He talks about the biogeographic patterns he observes and their implications for natural history, in terms both of the movement of species and of the geologic history of the region. He also narrates some of his personal experiences during his travels. The final chapter is an overview of the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural divisions among the people who live in the region and speculation about what such divisions might indicate about their history.|$|E
