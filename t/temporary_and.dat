5|$|After {{attaining}} {{tropical storm}} status, significant intensification was limited {{due to a}} slight increase in wind shear as well as impeded outflow. The slowing of the strengthening trend was <b>temporary,</b> <b>and</b> by early on April 16 the organization had rapidly improved. As a result, the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm. Warm water temperatures contributed to further intensification, and an eye formed {{in the center of the}} convection. At 1200UTC on April 16, the JMA classified Neoguri as a typhoon about 350km (220mi) east of Qui Nhon, Vietnam. An approaching mid-level trough turned the typhoon northwestward, which enhanced outflow and contributed to further intensification. Late on April 17, the JTWC assessed Neoguri as attaining peak winds of 175km/h (110mph), averaged over a duration of one minute, near the Paracel Islands. Early the next day, the JMA estimated Neoguri reached its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph), about 190km (120mi) east of Sanya on the southern tip of Hainan.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Molonglo River {{flowed through}} the flood basin, {{with only a}} small {{fraction}} of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, <b>temporary</b> <b>and</b> ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|Early on July 23, {{the storm}} briefly became disorganized, with the {{low-level}} circulation becoming ill-defined. Around the same time, Emilia passed about 175mi (280km) southwest of Manzanillo, which was its closest approach to southwestern Mexico; {{it is believed}} to have caused tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. Later that day, after turning west-northwestward, the convection increased markedly as an eyewall began to form. Operationally, it was estimated to have reached winds of 70mph (115km/h), and it was forecast to continue strengthening to attain Category2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the NHC later re-assessed Emilia as reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h), since the eye feature was <b>temporary</b> <b>and</b> not well-defined.|$|E

5|$|The Cow Tower was {{deliberately}} designed to house gunpowder artillery {{when it was}} first built, making it a very rare form of defensive structure for its time: the only equivalents in England are God's House Tower in Southampton, and the West Gate at Canterbury. The archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham {{go so far as to}} consider the building to be unique within Britain, as God's House was an extension of an existing building, and the West Gate part of the city's walled circuit. The concept of an isolated artillery tower was more common in France, where they were used as <b>temporary</b> <b>and</b> permanent defensive features during the Hundred Years War between the English and the French kings.|$|E

5|$|Clarke was {{a critic}} of migrant labour schemes, which were {{designed}} to attract foreign labour to Rhodesia, and in 1900 he defended the rights of indigenous labour against infringement by foreign Africans from Mozambique, Nyasaland, Zambia and South Africa. As early as 1900, the BSAC came to the Colonial Office with a proposal regarding Chinese labour. In London, the Land and Mine Owners Association was formed in 1902 to lobby the Colonial Office and continued to press throughout 1903. The Colonial Office postponed its decision saying that the question concerned not only Rhodesia but all of southern Africa. Milner was lobbied by the BSAC and he promised his support. Clarke, however, dismissed the demands, arguing that 'the introduction {{of large numbers of}} Asiatics... will subject the aboriginal natives to unfair competition'. He forecast that the labour shortage was <b>temporary</b> <b>and</b> that the new bureau would satisfy demand. Clarke also argued that most Rhodesians were opposed to the introduction of Chinese labour. The Duke of Marlborough, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, recorded that he found Clarke's argument more convincing than Milner's, and the Colonial Office refused the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Early on October8, {{after turning}} west-southwestward {{away from the}} Greater Antilles, Iris began {{strengthening}} again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) before the storm would hit Belize. It rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions, intensifying from 95mph (150km/h) to 140mph (225km/h) in a 12-hour period on October8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38mbar (1.12inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi (11km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3mi (5km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde {{into the center of}} Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a <b>temporary</b> <b>and</b> slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00UTC on October9, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.|$|E
5|$|The Geneva Conference {{opened on}} 8 May 1954, {{the day after}} the {{surrender}} of the garrison. Ho Chi Minh entered the conference on the opening day with the news of his troops' victory in the headlines. The resulting agreement temporarily partitioned Vietnam into two zones: the North was administered by the communist Democratic Republic of Vietnam while the South was administered by the French-supported State of Vietnam. The last units of the French Union forces withdrew from Indochina in 1956. This partition was supposed to be <b>temporary,</b> <b>and</b> the two zones were meant to be reunited through national elections in 1956. After the French withdrawal, the United States supported the southern government, under Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, which opposed the Geneva agreement, and which claimed that Ho Chi Minh's forces from the North had been killing Northern loyalists and terrorizing people both north and south. The North was supported by both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Soviet Union (USSR). This arrangement proved tenuous and escalated into the Vietnam War (Second Indochina War), eventually bringing 500,000 American troops into South Vietnam.|$|E
40|$|Objectives We {{aimed to}} review {{evidence}} {{on the relationship between}} <b>temporary</b> employment <b>and</b> health, and to see whether the association is dependent on outcome measure, instability of employment, and contextual factors. Method We systematically searched for studies of <b>temporary</b> employment <b>and</b> various health outcomes and critically appraised 27 studies. Results The review suggests higher psychological morbidity among temporary workers compared with permanent employees. According to some studies, temporary workers also have a higher risk of occupational injuries but their sickness absence is lower. Morbidity may be higher in temporary jobs with high employment instability and in countries with a lower number of <b>temporary</b> workers <b>and</b> unemployed workers. Conclusions The evidence indicates an association between <b>temporary</b> employment <b>and</b> psychological morbidity. The health risk may depend on instability of <b>temporary</b> employment <b>and</b> the context. Confounding by occupation may have biased some of the studies. Additional research to clarify the role of employment instability, hazard accumulation, and selection is recommended...|$|R

5|$|When George Clifford died in 1605, {{his wife}} Margaret became dowager countess and began {{repairing}} Brougham Castle, which became her favoured residence. Margaret contended with {{claims to the}} ownership of the family estates from her brother-in-law Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, but held onto Brougham Castle. Her daughter, Lady Anne Clifford continued {{the restoration of the}} castle and other Clifford properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616. The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates, however the privy council found in favour of Anne. The solution was only <b>temporary,</b> <b>and</b> in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford. Later the same year, JamesI visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour. It is estimated that the festivities cost around £1,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected.|$|E
5|$|Bede's best-known {{work is the}} Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, or An Ecclesiastical History of the English People, {{completed}} in about 731. Bede was aided in writing this book by Albinus, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. The first of the five books begins with some geographical background, and then sketches the history of England, beginning with Caesar's invasion in 55 BC. A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain, including the martyrdom of St Alban, {{is followed by the}} story of Augustine's mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons. The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604, and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria. These ended in disaster when Penda, the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632. The setback was <b>temporary,</b> <b>and</b> the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald of Northumbria and Oswy. The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby, traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history. The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury, and recounts Wilfrid's efforts to bring Christianity to the kingdom of Sussex. The fifth book brings the story up to Bede's day, and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia, and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter. Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf, king of Northumbria. The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it. The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf's approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede's monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility.|$|E
