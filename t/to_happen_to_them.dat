25|$|The {{marriage}} contracts {{represented a}} {{protection for the}} women, {{both in terms of}} financial security if anything were <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> or their husband, and in terms of having the liberty to annul the promise of marriage if the man they had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the filles du roi who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, while mayor, {{he wrote}} his first book, The Social Worker, which set out many of the {{principles}} that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:In a civilised community, {{although it may be}} composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.|$|E

500|$|SS-Obersturmführer Irmfried Eberl was {{appointed}} the camp's first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre {{and the only}} physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others {{point out that the}} number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command's wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka's ability to [...] "process" [...] these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague Unterscharführer Hans Hingst, Eberl's ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: [...] "So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled." [...] On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed what was going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to [...] away.|$|E

[...] "Kat is understandably very nervous and anxious about having another baby. Her head is all over the place. But before she has a chance {{to get used to the}} idea she suffers a miscarriage.

2500|$|In 1993 Minnesota {{passed a}} {{provision}} that added sexual orientation to the state's human rights law. The provision has been characterized by its supporters as protecting “gay and lesbian teachers and students from discrimination”. In early 2003 Rep. Lindner claimed that the provision was a shield {{for the promotion of}} [...] homosexuality, “In some of the schools, we've got children as young as three, in pre-school, on up through the years that are being taught homosexual practices. And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and so forth and healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators have told them that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but I don't hate any of them. I do love them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got to be that way. But it's my understanding that gays have hundreds and even thousands of partners over a lifetime.” His remarks were seen as offensive by many Minnesotan homosexuals who said “most gays and lesbians are in committed relationships.” [...] They also took issue with Lindner's suggestion that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.|$|E
