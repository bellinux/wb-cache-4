Extrapolation from our results to lower tranfers is comparable in magnitude with available data in that range.

40|$|This paper quantifies {{the welfare}} {{differences}} among a monetary union, {{flexible exchange rates}} (economic disintegration) and a monetary plus fiscal transfer union (higher economic integration). The vehicle of analysis is a medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model consisting of two heterogeneous countries. The model is solved using data from Germany and Italy. Our solutions imply that a switch to flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies would have negligible welfare implications. A similar result applies when we add interregional fiscal <b>tranfers</b> as insurance. By contrast, the addition of fiscal <b>tranfers</b> as redistribution has non-trivial implications and these depend crucially on whether such one-sided transfers trigger moral hazard behavior or not...|$|R
