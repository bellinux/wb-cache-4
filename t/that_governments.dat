5|$|Unfortunately, Daley's theory—that it can {{be better}} to get a sum X immediately, rather than getting over many years a sum Y that is {{substantially}} larger than X—assumes something that cannot be assumed. It assumes <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> will prudently husband sudden surges of revenue from the lease or sale of assets.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} decade, {{the newly formed}} Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera {{achieved}} power, he {{took advantage of the}} Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E
50|$|Also, if the {{government}} in question is not at the highest jurisdiction (i.e., is a state or municipal government), or the smaller <b>that</b> <b>government</b> is, the more along the risk-return spectrum <b>that</b> <b>government's</b> securities will be.|$|R
50|$|Those {{that support}} the Republican {{philosophy}} believe <b>that</b> <b>government</b> exists to do {{as little as possible}} for people. Those of us who are populists so to speak, and real Democrats, believe <b>that</b> <b>government</b> exists to help people. It's that simple.|$|R
50|$|While during Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign, {{many voters}} saw his {{warnings}} about a too-powerful government as hyperbolic and only 30% {{of the electorate}} agreed <b>that</b> <b>government</b> was too powerful, by 1980 a majority of Americans believed <b>that</b> <b>government</b> held too much power.|$|R
5|$|In September 1765, Adams {{was once}} again {{appointed}} by the Boston Town Meeting to write the instructions for Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author {{of a series of}} House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than those passed by the Stamp Act Congress. Adams {{was one of the first}} colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> could not violate.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism. Some types of border adjustment may also not prevent emissions leakage.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was gaining}} adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim {{was not to}} enter politics, but to persuade {{existing}} parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist {{in the midst of}} plenty and <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.|$|E

5|$|Away from Crescent's daily {{affairs and}} former {{political}} and media engagements, Ijaz {{has served on}} the College Foundation Board of Trustees at the University of Virginia, and he serves on the advisory board of the Rebuilding Afghanistan Foundation. RAF raises funds for building education infrastructure and programs in Afghanistan, including the construction of schools such as Mayar Elementary School, which enrolled 400 boys and girls from Maidan Wardak Province upon opening in late 2005. During the mid-1990s, Ijaz supported Developments in Literacy, an initiative to build and operate elementary schools in rural Pakistan as alternatives to the religious schools in which many Pakistani children were being radicalized. The group did not seek to create a secularized school system; its goal was to teach the Qur'an as one of many subjects rather than as the only subject. Ijaz and his wife Valérie also serve as goodwill ambassadors for a British charity, Children of Peace, that works to reconcile differences between Palestinian and Israeli youth. In late 2011, while addressing the World Peace Festival, a peace conference held in Berlin, Ijaz announced an intention to donate 1% of his net worth to create a Humanitarian Relief Fund that would make an effort to alleviate the root causes of poverty. In noting his belief <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> have often failed to provide assistance to the poor in sufficient ways over the long term, Ijaz sought similar pledges for the proposed fund from other philanthropists.|$|E

25|$|The {{economics}} {{of global warming}} concerns the economic aspects of global warming; this can inform policies <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> might consider in response. A number of factors make this a difficult problem from both economic and political perspectives: it is a long-term, intergenerational problem; benefits and costs are distributed unequally both within and across countries; and scientific and public opinions may diverge.|$|E
25|$|In essence, {{the lesson}} learned is <b>that</b> <b>governments</b> will use {{legislative}} and judicial means to thwart attempts {{to change the}} economic system, even when conducted by non-violent means.
