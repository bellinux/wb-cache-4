5|$|This <b>two-tier</b> <b>system</b> {{of local}} {{government}} lasted until 1996 when the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 came into effect, abolishing the regions and districts and replacing them with 32 unitary authorities.

Danley Middle school closed and St George's Middle School {{changed into a}} primary school with a £3 million fund, and Richmond First School now houses an extra year of students. This change was to bring the island up to date {{with the rest of}} the UK with the <b>two-tier</b> <b>system</b> (primary school, and then {{secondary}} school). Respectively, The Isle of Sheppey Academy now ranges from students of year 6 to 11, as well as housing the island's sixth form students.|$|E
5|$|State {{schools in}} Somerset are {{provided}} by three local education authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, and the larger Somerset County Council. All state schools are comprehensive. In some areas primary, infant and junior schools cater for ages four to eleven, after which the pupils move on to secondary schools. There is a three-tier system of first, middle and upper schools in the Cheddar Valley, and in West Somerset, while most other schools in the county use the <b>two-tier</b> <b>system.</b> Somerset has 30 state and 17 independent secondary schools; Bath and North East Somerset has 13 state and 5 independent secondary schools; and North Somerset has 10 state and 2 independent secondary schools, excluding sixth form colleges.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} found {{problems}} with <b>two-tier</b> <b>systems</b> like higher turnover for newer, lower-paid employees and a demoralized workforce. After enough time, a <b>two-tier</b> wage <b>system</b> can permanently lower wages in an entire industry. Lowering productivity expectations for new hires seems to alleviate some of the problems.|$|R
40|$|The {{exercise}} of insider power is frequently {{considered as a}} major cause of involuntary unemployment. The authors show that under standard assumptions [...] insiders are selfish and they need not fear the loss of their job [...] insider power does not cause unemployment but leads to the introduction of a market-clearing, <b>two-tier</b> wage <b>system.</b> Yet, while insider power is a common phenomenon, <b>two-tier</b> <b>systems</b> are rarely observed. To explain this fact, the authors introduce interdependent preferences. They show that, if entrants exhibit a preference for fairness, the presence of insider power gives rise to an efficiency wage effect that may prevent the introduction of market-clearing, <b>two-tier</b> <b>systems.</b> Copyright 1994 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Two-tier</b> <b>systems</b> {{became more}} common in most industrialized economies in the late 1980s. They are {{particularly}} attractive to companies with high rates of turnover for new hires, such as in retail, or with many high-wage, high-skilled employees about to retire.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} 12years after the county {{was created in}} 1974, Greater Manchester had a <b>two-tier</b> <b>system</b> of local government, and the {{metropolitan}} borough councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The Greater Manchester County Council, a strategic authority based {{in what is now}} Westminster House off Piccadilly Gardens, comprised 106 members drawn from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester. It was a sub-regional body running regional services such as transport, strategic planning, emergency services and waste disposal. In 1986, along with the five other metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council, the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished, and most of its powers were devolved to the boroughs. Between 1986 and 2011, the boroughs were effectively unitary authority areas, but opted to co-operate voluntarily under the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), which served to create a co-ordinated county-wide approach to issues of common interest to Greater Manchester, such as public transport and the shared labour market, as well as making representations to central government and the European Union.|$|E
5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a <b>two-tier</b> <b>system</b> of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for state}} schools in Dorset is divided between three local {{education}} authorities: Dorset County Council, which covers {{the majority of}} the county, and Bournemouth and Poole unitary authorities. Most of the Dorset County Council area operates a two-tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school. Only Dorchester, Ferndown, Wimborne and Purbeck maintain a three-tier system (first, middle and high school), although Purbeck is expected to switch to a <b>two-tier</b> <b>system</b> by 2013 because of an excess of unfilled places. Bournemouth operates a two-tier system; Poole operates a three-tier system but will switch to two tiers from September 2013. Poole and Bournemouth are two of a minority of local authorities in England to maintain selective education, each containing two single-sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven-plus examination. Some of the county's schools are academies—self-governing state schools which have become independent of their local education authority and are maintained directly by the Department for Education. In 2010, 59.4% of pupils attending schools in the county council area gained at least five GCSEs at A*–C grades including English and maths, above the national average of 53.4%. Bournemouth and Poole also recorded above average results at 56.5% and 55.3% respectively. However, most non-selective schools in the two unitary authorities fell below the national average.|$|E

50|$|In <b>two-tier</b> <b>systems</b> {{the seats}} in {{supervisory}} boards are usually limited to 1 to 3 members. In some systems the employees can select 1 or 2 members of the supervisory boards, but a representative of shareholders is always the president and has the deciding vote.

50|$|Trade unions {{generally}} seek {{to reduce}} wage dispersion, {{the differences in}} wages between workers doing the same job. Not all unions are successful, however. A 2008 study of collective bargaining agreements in the United States found that 25% of the union contracts surveyed included a <b>two-tier</b> wage <b>system.</b> Such <b>two-tier</b> wage <b>systems</b> are often economically attractive to both employers and unions. Employers see immediate reductions {{in the cost of}} hiring new workers. Existing union members see no wage reduction, and the number of new union members with lower wages is a substantial minority within the union and so is too small to prevent ratification. Unions also find <b>two-tier</b> wage <b>systems</b> attractive because they encourage the employer to hire more workers.|$|R
