5|$|Although {{popular with}} groupies, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry, {{was a former}} singer and came from a musically {{inclined}} family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye {{while he waited for}} Guruh, and he would also see her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. When she moved to Bali to work at a five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang-style wedding.|$|E

In 1964, while on spring break in the Bahamas, he met and began dating Neilia Hunter, who was from an affluent background in Skaneateles, New York and attended Syracuse University. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> aimed to become a Senator {{by the age of}} 30 and then President. He dropped a junior year plan to play for the varsity football team as a defensive back, enabling him to spend more time visiting out of state with her.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{had heard}} where his {{homestead}} was. Indeed, Festing had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> had known Charnock {{was coming to}} Donaldson's farm, he would have located farther off. She would sooner have avoided the meeting, but since it had happened, she must not cut it too short.|$|R
60|$|THERE {{was once}} upon a time {{a man and a woman}} who had an only son, and he was called Jack. The woman thought that it was his duty to go out to service, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to take him somewhere.|$|R
60|$|She reached {{home in the}} evening. She {{thought to}} find her father in his study. But they <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that,</b> now, <b>he</b> usually sat alone in the great drawing-room.

5|$|Hours earlier, Lucan had again {{called his}} mother, at about 12:30am. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would be in}} touch later that day, but {{declined}} {{to speak with the}} police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand-Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand-Kydd at his country house near Leighton Buzzard and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Psaltis was {{informed}} that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) employee Buh Buh Ray Dudley was interested in bringing her into ECW. At the behest of Dudley, Psaltis traveled to the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where ECW promoter Paul Heyman <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would book her for several appearances in an angle with Lance Storm. She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998 as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only {{supposed to have a}} three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Psaltis and Storm and offered her a contract, which she accepted. Psaltis created her character to be in love with Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous.|$|E
5|$|They {{discover}} that an unknown source of Eichner radiation {{is causing the}} growth. Separately, Ian (R.J. Williams), now appearing as an eight-year-old, confides to Troi {{that he is the}} source of the crew's problems and will have to leave. Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for medical assistance.

Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns into a ball of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E
60|$|He {{understood}} the allusion. Expressing sincere {{respect for her}} own convictions, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> honestly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was not prepared to}} enter on the obscure and terrible question of supernatural interposition. Grateful for the tone in which he had answered her, she wisely and delicately changed the subject.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{when first}} <b>he</b> heard of their mutual {{attachment}} {{he had been}} much disturbed, as {{he did not see}} how they were to marry.|$|R

She started writing letters to him, believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Ashin. Finally, Xuan's peking opera group from school gets to leave Harbin and travel to Taiwan to perform. The two promised to meet in a library, but Ah Lei didn't {{have the courage to}} meet up with her. He decides to follow her around, but did not expect that she followed him back, and that she saw through his lies all along.|$|R

60|$|She paused {{before she}} spoke again. His face <b>told</b> <b>her</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{thinking}} of <b>her</b> when <b>he</b> made <b>that</b> reply. She was grateful to him, but her mind was not with him: her mind was still {{with the man who}} had deserted her. She turned round again to the fire.|$|R

60|$|To {{her father}} himself, {{he wrote in}} the same strain; but, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> father <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{expressly}} confided his wife and child to his care.

60|$|The {{sculptor}} {{at first}} merely smiled.

60|$|After a time it {{appeared}} that Sally had a suitor.

He would tell this story over and over again to his mob {{associates}} for amusement.|$|E
25|$|Meredith often wrote {{unsigned}} {{articles for}} the Tasmanian press. This was no new {{thing for her}} as in her youth she had written articles {{in support of the}} Chartists.

After her husband's death she was granted a pension of £100 a year by the Tasmanian government.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, CBS {{presented}} a made-for-television movie about obedience experiments, The Tenth Level, with William Shatner as Stephen Hunter, a Milgram-like scientist.

60|$|Even {{in those}} days Lawson was not popular and really no one took enough {{interest}} in him to bother.
