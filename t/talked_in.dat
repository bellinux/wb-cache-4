25|$|Around 1975, Will Crowther, a {{programmer}} and an amateur caver, {{wrote the first}} text adventure game, Adventure (originally called ADVENT because a filename could only be six characters long in the operating system he was using, and later named Colossal Cave Adventure). Having just gone through a divorce, {{he was looking for}} a way to connect with his two young children. Over the course of a few weekends, he wrote a text based cave exploration game that featured a sort of guide/narrator who <b>talked</b> <b>in</b> full sentences and who understood simple two word commands that came close to natural English. Adventure was programmed in Fortran for the PDP-10. Crowther's original version was an accurate simulation of part of the real Colossal Cave, but also included fantasy elements (such as axe-wielding dwarves and a magic bridge).|$|E

25|$|During {{the meeting}} of top Carlist leaders in Insua in February 1937 Araúz seemed {{undecided}} about the Carlist strategy towards the forthcoming unification threat, concerned more about the unity of Traditionalism. Together with Lamamié de Clairac he <b>talked</b> <b>in</b> Villarreal de Álava to the Falangist leader Manuel Hedilla and agreed that either unification would take place on their terms, or not at all. He is listed {{as a member of}} the in-between Carlist group, neither decisively opposing nor decisively supporting the unification, though he soon adopted a dissident stand and in October 1937 got expulsed from Falange Española Tradicionalista. His bid to build Carlist sindicates failed. Though CESO tried to avoid amalgamation by federating within the ONC, Obra Nacional Corporativa was eventually incorporated into the Francoist trade unions and Araúz was removed from integrated labor structures. Personally regarded unfavourably in the Franco headquarters, he enlisted to the Requetes and took part in the Biscay campaign, finally withdrawing from the Francoist political and military structures.|$|E
25|$|The next part in Guth's path {{came when}} he heard a lecture by Steven Weinberg in early 1979. Weinberg <b>talked</b> <b>in</b> two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that had been {{developed}} since 1974, and how it could explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared to the amount of antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very hot conditions, such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg’s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.|$|E
25|$|It is said until Nasir left Malé Gayoom praised Nasir and <b>talked</b> <b>in</b> {{favour of}} him (As {{in his first}} speech after being sworn in as president). But after Nasir left Malé {{everything}} changed. After he left Malé, mass demonstrations were held against him, labeling him traitor, calling for his death. He was tried in absentia and sentenced. 16 May 1980 was the day Gayoom himself led a massive demonstration against Nasir and his 'crowd' in which Gayoom spoke to a crowd of between 15,000 and 20,000 (the population of Malé was then about 35,000) in which he discussed his views about how Nasir came to power, how he {{had been one of}} the leaders in the overthrow of first president Mohamed Ameen in 1953 and how he had allegedly mishandled government money. However, the allegations against Nasir were never proven. Later Gayoom pardoned him in July 1990, but never granted permission for him to return to Maldives. This point turned out to be proven according to an interview given by Kuvaa Mohamed Maniku, a close associate of Nasir to TVM on 23 November 2008. Maniku said he met President Nasir at Bangkok Airport in 1990 after Nasir had been pardoned by the Government and Nasir had told Maniku he had sent a letter to President Gayoom requesting permission to return to Maldives and to live anywhere in the country approved by President Gayoom. According to Maniku, late President Nasir had told him that he had not received a reply from Gayoom.|$|E

On 4 August 2017, the singer released the compilation video of covers and parodies of the song and the visual on her YouTube account. Owen Myers of The Fader praised the female-empowerment themes of the clip, and furthermore commented on its importance on Lipa's career, stating that, [...] "The release of 'New Rules' gave Lipa something else that until then mostly eluded her: credibility.
