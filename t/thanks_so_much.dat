This happened late in their first year of marriage, and since then she's eaten to fill up the awful emptiness inside. Oh hearing this Johnny takes her in his arms and kisses her.

They’re just about gone now, but I’ve {{found a place}} in town where I can buy them, so I’ll keep supplied. This morning I shot 90 ° stages.

I have another period of these then I go on to 180 ° side, and 360 ° side and {{overhead}} approaches. They’re a lot of fun. The instructor goes over {{with one of the}} cadets and the other three fly over solo. (To Haley Field) There we line up the ships ready for takeoff, and the instructor signals us with a greenlight one by one when it is all clear for the takeoff. We’re graded on everything, glide approach, turns in the pattern, takeoff, and landing. They’re {{a hell of a lot}} of fun. I saw “The Hour Before Dawn,” it was good, wasn’t it. Last night I had a date with a sharp girl. She reminds me of Pat Ward, my old flame back home, remember? Saturday she and I and Bill Cross and her sister are going to the Paramount Club. She’s a swell girl, really a lot of fun, plenty of personality, too. I’ve got two hours in the Link now. Boy that’s some machine. It costs 17, 000 ! The damn thing is uncanny, it stalls, spins, and does everything a real ship can do. But they’re hell to fly, stiff and very touchy. They don’t handle like a plane.

This week {{we begin our}} star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E
