25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.

5000|$|Egill {{has been}} criticized for his alleged misogyny. Egill posted blog {{articles}} in 2007 that called feminists [...] "disgusting and mentally ill", saying that <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with masculine men so that they'd start behaving [...] "like normal women". He went on to list several politicians and high-profile Icelandic women, detailing who <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> intercourse with and what sex acts <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> perform. Drífa Snædal, one of the women mentioned in Egill's blog post, for wanting hospitals to provide unisex clothing for newborns, criticized Egill publicly. Among the things said about Drífa were: [...] "she has never had a hard cock, so we <b>have</b> decided <b>to</b> send Ásgeir, Jamal, Buka and Yao <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex with her", [...] "it is time to shut her up for good", and [...] "they will stuff her like a holiday turkey" [...] to [...] "make her shut up and behave".|$|R

25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had such a hard time {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E

500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where}} the audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sporveien Trikken is in {{the process}} of buying new trams. Because of their poor {{technical}} state and high maintenance costs, the company may chose to replace all its SL95, despite their age. The tramway is pursuing a shelfware tram mode which has low investment costs and optimized for street running. If the trams are to be used concurrently with the metro, <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a reinforced cab to better withstand a head-on collision and automatic train protection. This will make procuring shelfware impossible, while providing worse sight-lines for the motorman and increased damage in case of collisions elsewhere. The increased unit cost per tram would be about 2 to 3.5 million kroner. In addition, the infrastructure at Bekkestua does not allow for trams with the international standard of [...] loading gauge.

60|$|Now, ghost-worship {{and dead}} ancestor-worship are {{impossible}} before the ancestor {{is dead and}} is a ghost. But the essential idea of Mungan-ngaur, and Baiame, {{and most of the}} high gods of Australia, and of other low races, is that they never died at all. They belong to the period before death came into the world, like Qat among the Melanesians. They arise in an age that knew not death, and had not reflected on phantasms nor evolved ghosts. They could have been conceived of, {{in the nature of the}} case, by a race of immortals who never dreamed of such a thing as a ghost. For these gods, the ghost-theory is not required, and is superfluous, even contradictory. The early thinkers who developed these beings did not need to know that men die (though, of course, they did know it in practice), still less did <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> conceived by abstract speculation the hypothesis of ghosts.
