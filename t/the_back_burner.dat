5|$|In 2009, {{with the}} {{production}} beginning to coalesce, Scorsese and a production crew went to Nagasaki, Japan, visiting the original sites {{that served as the}} setting for Endō's novel. Additional location scouting was conducted in Canada. However, Silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards, and Scorsese decided to work on Shutter Island and Hugo instead. In December 2011, Scorsese stated that Silence would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner</b> and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of Silence. However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated that Silence would come first. In May, the film picked up another producer in the recently revived Cecchi Gori Pictures, which placed the project first on its slate of upcoming films. Cecchi Gori was involved in pre-production for Silence, but years of unrelated legal disputes had interrupted its association to the film.|$|E
5|$|Negro {{became one}} of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka, Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's {{position}} as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka, Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octagón and La Parka, Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.|$|E

Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought about changes in the Indian constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment (most popularly known as the Anti-Secessionist Amendment) banned any party with sectarian principles from participating in elections. When this amendment was presented in the Parliament of India, Annadurai was one of its members. He vehemently debated against the amendment, but eventually could not stop it from being passed.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999 Cibernético formed another rudo faction, a {{group called}} Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was {{inspired}} by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Abismo Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers after Cibernético. Cibernético looked like he could repeat as Rey de Reyes winner at the 2000 Event, but was defeated by Abismo Negro in the final. A few months later Cibernético teamed up with LLL members Abismo Negro, Electroshock and Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler Shiima Nobunaga in the main event of Triplemanía VIII, only to lose to Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and El Alebrije. While Cibernético was leading LLL Abismo Negro was rising {{through the ranks of}} AAA, bolstered by his leadership of Los Vipers.

Cibernético would retain the title until AAA quietly stopped promoting the belt some time in 2005. Cibernético's LLL was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of AAA founder and owner Antonio Peña and led to a match between Cibernético and Peña, who had been a wrestler before retiring in the 1980s. The two wrestled at the 2001 Guerrera de Titanes which Cibernético easily won in under three minutes.

40|$|International audienceOver a {{long period}} of time labour law in Africa was kept on <b>the</b> « <b>back</b> <b>burner</b> » as far as {{regionalisation}} was concerned. This is no longer the case since the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) has put into operation a Uniform Act on labour law project. Difficulties have arisen however with regard to its adoption. In fact, a «Uniform Act of OHADA » must be unanimously agreed by seventeen Member States. In addition, this legal instrument corresponds more to « hard law » than the « soft law ». Its contents have a compulsory effect on all concerned. Furthermore, in sub-Saharan Africa, although of minimal effect, labour law remains « politically sensitive » for the State. Paradoxically, the text of the project constitutes an immediate reference for national reforms. Albeit, it will be interesting to analyse the main issues. The project witnesses international tendencies with regard to labour law while inscribing itself into a particular normative tradition. Officially it aims at attracting investors in the region. Its priority is not to take into account the dominant socio-economic realities, even less to fight against the increasing informalisation of labour relations in Africa...|$|R

40|$|Venting range hoods are {{important}} residential ventilation components that remove pollutants generated by cooking activities {{and natural gas}} cooking burners. To address the lack of data on range hood installations in California, we conducted a survey by examining photographs of homes for sale or rent listed on a popular real estate web site. The survey was conducted in November 2010 and April–May 2011. Posted photos of the homes were reviewed {{to determine if a}} hood was installed, the type of hood, and two installation details that can impact performance, namely the height above the cooktop {{and the degree to which}} the hood covers the cooktop burners. We additionally collected information about the homes, including asking price for purchase or rent, type of building (e. g. detached house, townhouse or apartment), building age, floor area, and cooktop fuel type. Listings were first sampled to focus on homes built since 2005, then randomly sampled to include varied prices and locations around the state. Data were obtained for 1002 homes built between 1865 and 2011 (median year built 1989). Homes for sale varied in asking price from $ 16, 000 to $ 16, 500, 000 (median $ 353, 000) and homes for rent varied from $ 500 to $ 25, 000 (median $ 2125) per month. Approximately 74 % of the sample had natural gas cooktops. In this sample, natural gas cooktops were more prevalent in more expensive homes than in less expensive homes. Across the entire sample, 7. 4 % appeared to have no hood installed, 33 % had a short hood, 13 % had a deep hood and 47 % had a microwave over the range. The percentage of these hoods that vent to the outdoors could not be determined. Hood type was related to coverage of the cooktop. For deep hoods, 76 % appeared to cover most or all of the cooktop burners. For short hoods, 70 % covered about three quarters of the cooktop. And for microwaves the vast majority (96 %) covered <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burners</b> but not <b>the</b> front burners. Hood type was also correlated with asking price or monthly rent, with deep hoods most common in the most expensive homes. Hood type was also correlated with home age, with microwave hoods more common in newer homes. Installation height was related to device type with microwaves installed lower (closer) to the cooktop (median 18 inches), and short hoods (median 28 inches) and deep hoods (median 30 inches) installed higher. Deep range hoods are more common with natural gas cooktops than with electric cooktops, and slightly fewer homes with natural gas cooktops lack a range hood (7 %) than homes with electric cooktops (9 %). This study provides limited but useful information about the characteristics of range hoods in California homes and demonstrates the potential value of non-traditional forms of data collection...|$|R

50|$|Gas stoves today use {{two basic}} types of {{ignition}} sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame is between <b>the</b> front and <b>back</b> <b>burners.</b> When <b>the</b> stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing {{out of the}} burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system {{is that it is}} simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a flame failure device, lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the flame failure device cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|R
