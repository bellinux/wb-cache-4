40|$|The {{presence}} of numerous changes in T lymphocyte activity found in MS patients {{points to the}} involvement of the thymus in multiple sclerosis. The etiophathogenetic mechanism of MS is probably an autoimmune reaction that is triggered by a viral infection caused by one or more viruses and that perpetuates itself, causing the disease to progress. It has been proved that the thymus maintains its immunocompetence even in adulthood and that it has a role in the pathogenesis in several autoimmune diseases. In exacerbations of MS there is a decrease in <b>T</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> while histological and lymphocyte subset changes have been demonstrated in the thymus of MS patients. The lymphocyte response to mitogens is also depressed in MS.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{corticosteroid}} given in vivo on human lymphocyte subpopulation function were investigated using an in vitro system of pokeweek mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin production. Peripheral blood lymphocytes {{were obtained from}} normal volunteers before and 4 h after the intravenous administration of methylprednisolone. Unfractioned peripheral blood lymphocytes showed a consistent decrease (mean ≅ 50 %) in immunoglobulin and total protein synthesis after steroid administration. Utilizing separated thymus-derived (T) and bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocyte fractions, the pathophysiology of this alteration in immunoglobulin production was elucidated. B lymphocytes obtained after steroid treatment showed a markedly diminished immunoglobulin response (20 % of normal) to normal T lymphocytes and to normal T cells that had been irradiated to remove <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function. All major classes of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were affected. T lymphocytes procured after steroid administration were capable of providing normal amounts of T cell help for B cells in immunoglobulin production. However, <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activity, observed with normal T lymphocytes at high T to B cell ratios, was absent from the post-steroid T lymphocytes. This loss of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function was not due {{to the presence of}} excess help as irradiated pre- and poststeroid T cells provided equal amounts of helper activity. On recombining the poststeroid treatment B cells, which are hyporesponsive in immunoglobulin synthesis, with the posttreatment <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which lack <b>suppressor</b> activity, diminished amounts of immunoglobulin were produced which correlate well with the effects observed with unseparated cells.

Fifty seven men whose ratio of T helper <b>lymphocytes</b> to <b>T</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (CD 4 :CD 8 ratio) was less than 1. 0 before the study began were included. Forty two were positive for antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), of whom 38 were reinvestigated after a median observation period of 10 months. Among the seropositive men the transformation responses to pokeweed mitogen and cytomegalovirus and the absolute count of CD 4 positive lymphocytes were the most common abnormal values. In particular, a low relative response to pokeweed mitogen on initial investigation correlated with a worsened clinical condition on reinvestigation. The risk of a worsened clinical condition was 55 times higher in seropositive men whose responses to pokeweed mitogen were low than in other seropositive men. The corresponding relative risks for low transformation responses to cytomegalovirus and for a decreased absolute count of CD 4 positive lymphocytes were 18 and six. The relative response to pokeweed mitogen is therefore a very sensitive short term predictive marker of the clinical condition of seropositive patients who have a CD 4 :CD 8 ratio of less than 1. 0...|$|R

Using a morphometric evaluation, the average number of both intraepithelial and stromal lymphocyte subsets and of the intraepithelial Langerhans cells was assessed. In all the biopsies preceding the medical treatment we found a low number of T helper lymphocytes both in the epithelium and stroma, with inversion of T 4 /T 8 lymphocyte ratio and rare presence of Langerhans cells. In patients with a good therapeutic response (50 - 100 % of condyloma reduction) we observed an increase in intraepithelial T 4 lymphocytes and a decrease in both intraepithelial and stromal T 8 lymphocytes. In cases with persistent disease after therapy, the histological pattern was similar to that observed in the first biopsy, {{with the exception of a}} significant increase in the average number of Langerhans cells.

We were {{interested to know}} whether thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) would change during treatment and whether values of TSI {{would allow us to}} determine the prognosis of the disease after a one year course of MMI. In order to measure these TSI, a bioassay was developed measuring cAMP in cultured human thyroid cells in vitro. Assuming an influence of T lymphocytes on autoantibody production, we were also interested to know whether these patients would have abnormal numbers of T helper- and/or <b>T</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which would explain the abnormal immune status. In order to measure these T lymphocyte subpopulations we used monoclonal antibodies specific for these subpopulations and counted the cells with a fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (FACS). A parallel study in the same patients was performed to investigate the sensitivity of two different methods for the measurement of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (chapter IV). The cAMP bioassay was compared with two commercially available kits measuring inhibition of binding of TSH to thyroid cell membranes. Also conventional thyroid autoantibodies (anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-microsomal antibodies) were measured as another expression of autoimmunity in this disease.

Our results indicate that tolerogenic DCs and <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are present in melanoma at all stages of disease progression. They express transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (TGFβR 1), and are therefore susceptible to TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 2 specifically expressed by primary melanoma. We found that expression of IDO and interleukin 10 (IL- 10) increased with melanoma progression, with the highest concentration in positive SLN. We suggest that negative SLN contain immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, due to preconditioning by tolerogenic DCs migrating from the primary melanoma site to the SLN. In primary melanoma, TGFβ 2 is likely to render peripheral DCs tolerogenic, while in lymph nodes IDO and TGFβ 1 may have a major effect.

The suppressor activity gradually increased with lapse of time from the irradiation to the suppressor cell assay. <b>Suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were resistant to X-ray irradiation and independent of DNA synthesis. On the other hand, irradiation-induced enhancement was minimal in cultures incubated with Con A, regardless of the irradiation time. As irradiation of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes was found to induce a suppressor function in vitro, clinical and experimental applications of irradiation in cases of a suppressed T lymphocyte function may be feasible...|$|R
40|$|Employing cell {{fractionation}} {{with the}} aid of peanut agglutinin, it was found that at least two subpopulations of T cells are required for the generation of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in culture. The co-operation of these two subpopulations, the medullary and the cortical types of thymocytes, is required for the induction phase but it apparently plays no role in the expression of the suppressive effect. With the aid of genetic markers, it was found that in medullary-type, cortisone-resistant, PNA-negative T cell was the progenitor of the <b>suppressor</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> while the cortical type cells performed an accessory (regulatory?) function. Finally, it was observed that allostimulation of T cells in culture give rise to both 'helper' and suppressor cells. The generation of 'helper' lymphocytes requires allostimulation for less than 24 hr while the induction of suppressor cells requires a longer period of stimulation which leads in the end to predominance of the suppressor effect...|$|R
40|$|Induction of {{immunological}} tolerance to alloantigens {{would be the}} treatment of choice to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and allograft rejection in transplantation medicine. Organisms {{use a variety of}} mechanisms to avoid potentially deadly immunity to self-antigens. The most potent self-tolerance mechanism is probably dominant tolerance assured by regulatory and <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> It appears therefore attractive to use the same mechanism to induce transplantation-tolerance. We here review and discuss recent advances in the use of one of the best-characterized regulatory T lymphocyte populations, CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T cells, to prevent graft-versus-host disease and bone marrow allograft rejection...|$|R
40|$|Exposure of mice to {{ultraviolet}} (UV) -B (280 – 320 nm) radiation alters their {{immune response}} to contact-sensitizing haptens applied to UV-irradiated skin. Under these conditions, the contact-hypersensitivity response is reduced, and haptenspecific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{can be found}} in the spleen. Considerable evidence suggests that the epidermal Langerhans cell is one of the principal targets of this effect of UV irradiation that leads, ultimately, to suppressor cell formation. We are using a combination of cell-surface markers and light and electron microscopy to determine whether differences can be detected in the antigen-presenting cells involved in contact sensitization of normal and UV-irradiated mice...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the immune {{status of a}} congenitally asplenic, otherwise healthy and anatomically normal 30 -year-old woman. As in surgically asplenic subjects, she had Howell-Jolly bodies in a blood smear, increased B lymphocyte and decreased <b>T</b> helper and <b>suppressor</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> percentages, and a slightly lower than average T helper/suppressor ratio. Because of the increased risk of infection with capsulate bacteria in asplenic patients, the subject was immunized with Pneumovax and meningococcal vaccine and her serum antibody responses were investigated. She {{was found to have}} subnormal IgG antibody titres which did not increase on immunization, although the subclass distribution of anti-pneumococcal antibody was normal with IgG 2 predominating. IgM antibody titres were higher than in a pool of normal adult human sera, while IgA levels increased substantially as in normal subjects...|$|R
40|$|Mouse {{and human}} {{interferon}} can modify the immune response in different and seemingly contradictory ways (1). Thus, interferon preparations inhibit lymphocyte proliferation {{in a primary}} mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) 1 (2 - 5) but, on the other hand, enhance lymphocytotoxicity (3 - 6). We wanted to determine the action of interferon on the generation of other functional lymphocyte subsets, such as allospecific primed lymphocytes (7, 8) or <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (9 - 12). The results presented herein show that human interferon inhibits the generation of allospecific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> that normally develop from lymphocytes primed in vitro against allogeneic ceils (9 - 12). This effect might influence considerably the generation of other functional lymphocyte subsets during an allogeneic response, such as cytotoxic effector cells and allospecific primed lymphocytes. Materials and Methods Donors. Normal individuals and families were HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C typed with highly selected local and VIIIth Workshop typing sera, with the standard National Institutes of Health two-stage complement-dependent lymphocytotoxicity technique at room temperature. B lymphocyte DRw determinants were typed on B-enriched cell suspensions with an adaptation of the same technique (13). Medium. Tissue culture medium was RPMI 1640 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, NY) buffered with NaHCO. ~, supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 /. tg/ml), and fungizone (250 /xg/ml), and enriched with normal human serum. Lymphocytes. Peripheral lymphocytes were purified from heparinized blood on a Ficoll...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{condition was}} established in vivo for selectively eliminating hapten-reactive suppressor T-cell activity generated in mice primed with a para-azobenzoate (PAB) -mouse gamma globulin (MGG) -conjugate and treated with PAB-nonimmunogenic copolymer of D-amino acids (D- glutamic acid and D-lysine; D-GL). The elimination of suppressor T-cell activity with PAB-D-GL treatment from the mixed populations of hapten- reactive <b>suppressor</b> and helper <b>T</b> cells substantially increased apparent helper T-cell activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PAB-reactive suppressor T-cell generation by the pretreatment with PAB-D-GL before the PAB-MGG-priming increased the development of PAB-reactive helper T-cell activity. The analysis of hapten-specificity of helper T cells revealed that the reactivity of helper cells developed {{in the absence of}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells was more specific for primed PAB-determinants and their cross-reactivities to structurally related determinants such as meta-azobenzoate (MAB) significantly decreased, as compared with the helper T-cell population developed in the presence of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In addition, those helper T cells generated in the absence of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells were highly susceptible to tolerogenesis by PAB-D- GL. Similarly, the elimination of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> also enhanced helper T-cell activity in a polyclonal fashion in the T-T cell interactions between benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) -reactive T cells and PAB- reactive T cells after immunization of mice with BPO-MGG-PAB. Thus inhibition of BPO-reactive suppressor T-cell development by the BPO-v-GL- pretreatment resulted in augmented generation of PAB-reactive helper T cells with higher susceptibility of tolerogenesis to PAB-D-GL. Thus, these results support the notion that <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells eventually suppress helper T-cell activity and indicate that the function of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells related to helper T-cell development is to inhibit the increase in the specificity and apparent affinity of helper T cells in the primary immune response. The hapten-reactive <b>suppressor</b> and helper <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are considered as a model system of T cells that regulate the immune response, and the potential applicability of this system to manipulating various T cell-mediated immune responses is discussed in this context...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{bacterial}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS) {{on the development}} of plaque-forming cells (PFC) against bromelain-treated syngeneic mouse red blood cells (Br-MRBC) was studied in peritoneal cell (PC) cultures. It was found that LPS enhances the development of PFC to Br-MRBC and increases DNA synthesis in PC cultures. The LPS-induced enhancement of PFC to Br-MRBC, however, does not appear to require cell proliferation, since it also occurred in PC cultures pretreated with mitomycin C. In addition, the LPS-induced B lymphocytes blastogenesis is under the control of macrophages, while cell differentiation of precursor B lymphocytes into cells actively producing antibodies against Br-MRBC is regulated by <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte...</b>|$|R
