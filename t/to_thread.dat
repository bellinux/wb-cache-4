Two minutes later Coquelin over-hit his pass which was directed to Özil, who roamed freely. Chelsea made another change, this time Oscar in place of Ramires in the 53rd minute. Seven minutes later Chelsea came close to scoring when Eden Hazard managed to evade his markers, but through on goal failed to get his shot on target, hitting over. Azpilicueta was shown the game's first yellow card for pulling Oxlade-Chamberlain back; Mourinho {{made the decision to}} substitute him with Kurt Zouma in the 69th minute.

40|$|Actor {{frameworks}} {{running on}} Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform face two main challenges in utilizing multi-core architectures, i) efficiently mapping actors <b>to</b> JVM <b>threads,</b> and ii) scheduling JVM threads on multi-core. JVM-based actor frameworks allow fine tuning of actors <b>to</b> <b>threads</b> mapping, however scheduling of threads on multi-core {{is left to}} the OS scheduler. Hence, efficiently mapping actors <b>to</b> <b>threads</b> is critical for achieving good performance and scalability. In the existing JVM-based actor frameworks, programmers select default actors <b>to</b> <b>threads</b> mappings and iteratively fine tune the mappings until the desired performance is achieved. This process is tedious and time consuming when building large scale distributed applications. We propose a technique that automatically maps actors <b>to</b> JVM <b>threads.</b> Our technique {{is based on a}} set of heuristics with the goal of balancing actors computations across JVM threads and reducing communication overheads. We explain our technique {{in the context of the}} Panini programming language, which provides capsules as an actor-like abstraction for concurrency, but also explore its applicability to other approaches...|$|R
5|$|On 17 January 2011, Bent {{submitted}} a transfer request, amid reports that Aston Villa {{had made a}} club record £18million bid for him, which was rejected. Villa then {{submitted a}}n improved offer of £18million, potentially rising to £24million, which was then accepted. The following day, Bent completed his move to Villa and signed a four-and-a-half-year deal. He scored the winning goal on his debut against Manchester City in a 1–0 victory at Villa Park. Bent scored his second Villa goal in his third appearance for his team when he completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 3–1 away defeat. Bent scored both of Villa's goals in their 2–1 away victory over Arsenal in the penultimate match of the season on 15 May. The first was a nicely crafted volley after he chested down a Kyle Walker chipped pass, with the second coming {{a few minutes later}} after a slip from Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen allowed Ashley Young the time <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> a pass through the Gunners' defence and Bent to sidefoot home for 2–0. He finished the season with 9 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Villa, becoming the club's joint top-scorer with Ashley Young, despite only joining in January. He was also the top English goalscorer in the Premier League and the fourth highest scorer overall that season with 17 goals, eight of which were scored for Sunderland.|$|E

Junction 27 (High Cross) is a normal grade-separated roundabout junction, but subject to severe space constraints: traffic joining the motorway must initially travel in the opposite direction to the intended direction of travel, before making a sharp left-hand turn from the slip road onto the motorway. Junctions 30–31 (East Cardiff) were set aside for intermediate additional interchanges at the time of construction. Junction 30 (Cardiff Gate) has since been added but there are no current plans to construct Junction 31 (A469 road).

25|$|The premiere {{was set for}} October 6, 1927, at Warner Bros.' {{flagship}} {{theater in}} New York City; it was chosen to coincide with Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday around which much of the movie's plot revolves. The buildup to the premiere was tense. Besides Warner Bros.' precarious financial position, the physical presentation of the film itself was remarkably complex: Each of Jolson's musical numbers was mounted on a separate reel with a separate accompanying sound disc. Even though the film was only eighty-nine minutes long...there were fifteen reels and fifteen discs to manage, and the projectionist {{had to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> the film and cue up the Vitaphone records very quickly.

500|$|At 00:45, Seydlitz was {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>thread</b> {{her way through}} the British fleet, but was sighted by the dreadnought [...] and noted as a [...] "ship or Destroyer". Agincourts captain did not want to risk giving away his ship's position, and so allowed her to pass. By 01:12, Seydlitz had managed to slip through the British fleet, and she was able to head for the safety of Horns Reef. At approximately 03:40, she scraped over Horns Reef. Both of the ship's gyro-compasses had failed, so the light cruiser Pillau was sent to guide the ship home. By 15:30 on 1 June, Seydlitz was in critical condition; the bow was nearly completely submerged, and the only buoyancy that remained in the forward section of the ship was the broadside torpedo room. Preparations were being made to evacuate the wounded crew when a pair of pump steamers arrived on the scene. The ships were able to stabilize Seydlitzs flooding, and the ship managed to limp back to port. She reached the outer Jade river on the morning of 2 June, and on 3 June the ship entered Entrance III of the Wilhelmshaven Lock. At most, Seydlitz had been flooded by [...] of water.|$|E
