40|$|In this paper, a central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann (CLB) {{method for}} {{incompressible}} <b>thermal</b> <b>flows</b> is proposed. In the method, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the convection-diffusion equation for the temperature field are sloved separately by two different CLB equations.

For the flow field, the tedious implementation for CLB method is simplified {{by using the}} shift matrix with a simplified central-moment set, and the consistent forcing scheme is adopted to incorporate forcing effects. Compared with several D 2 Q 5 multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann methods for the temperature equation, the proposed method is shown to be better Galilean invariant through measuring the thermal diffusivities on a moving reference frame. Thus a higher Mach number {{can be used for}} convection flows, which decreases the computational load significantly.

40|$|In an {{analysis}} of the incompressible flow, it is assumed that the density is constant in space and time. However in a <b>thermal</b> fluid <b>flow,</b> the movement of fluid occurs by the variation of density and volume change of heat transportation. In the conventional analysis of <b>thermal</b> fluid <b>flow,</b> sometimes the incompressibility is also assumed and the Boussinesq approximation is implemented. However it is necessary that the variation of density influence of energy in fluid is considered in order to analyze the detailed behavior of the <b>thermal</b> fluid <b>flow.</b> Therefore the compressible Navier-Stokes equation is appropriate to express detailed behavior of the <b>thermal</b> fluid <b>flow.</b> The purpose of this research is the application of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation for <b>thermal</b> fluid <b>flow.</b> The other purpose is to formulate the optimal control of temperature using the Automatic Differentiation in the <b>thermal</b> fluid <b>flow.</b> It is important to pursue high quality of the gradient computation in the inverse problem. Sometimes, it is called as the sensitivity analysis. In case of the inverse analysis, the minimization technique of function is often used. However, to pursue the variation is difficult to formulate and to program. Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a method of computation to pursue the variation of functional automatically. The AD is implemented with C++ programs using operator overloading technique. The partial derivatives are computed according to the differentiation rule of a composite function whenever the basic operation is performed. By using AD, the first order variation can be obtained.
