5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
25|$|A single <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> is {{composed}} of four different types of cells, and each <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the <b>taste</b> <b>bud.</b> Every cell in the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> forms microvilli at the ends.|$|R
40|$|Colchicine blocks mitotic {{division}} of the epithelial cells surrounding the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> of the rat tongue. Response to chemical stimulation decreases 50 per cent 3 hours after colchicine injection as measured by recording the electrical activity from the taste nerve bundle. Radioautography, using tritiated thymidine, shovvs that those epithelial cells surrounding the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> divide {{and that some of}} the daughter cells enter the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> and slowly move toward the center. The life span of the average cell is about 250 - 4 - 50 hours, although some cells have a much shorter and others a much longer life span. These studies suggest that the cells within the <b>taste</b> <b>bud,</b> as well as the nerves, undergo considerable change with time. Corresponding changes in function are considered...|$|R

5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} a {{receptor}} potential is in a <b>taste</b> <b>bud,</b> where <b>taste</b> is converted into an electrical signal sent to the brain. When stimulated, the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> triggers the release of neurotransmitter through exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic membrane of the primary sensory neuron, where they elicit an action potential.|$|R

25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is covered in {{masticatory}} mucosa a type of oral mucosa which is of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Embedded in this are numerous papillae that house the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> and their taste receptors. The lingual papillae consist of filiform, fungiform, vallate and foliate papillae. and only the filiform papillae are not associated with any <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} taste {{is based on the}} {{detection}} of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells. Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells {{at the base of the}} taste bud. A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> Fungiform papillae are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The salivary glands are responsible for keeping the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> moist with saliva.|$|E

25|$|Taste is the {{sensation}} produced when a substance {{in the mouth}} reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue. Taste, along with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. The gustatory cortex {{is responsible for the}} perception of taste.|$|E

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} (CR) is {{a lifestyle}} intervention employed to reduce body weight and improve metabolic functions pri-marily via reduction of ingested carbohydrates and fats. Taste perception is highly related to functional metabolic status and body adiposity. We have previously shown that sweet taste perception diminishes with age; however, relatively {{little is known}} about the effects of various lengths of CR upon taste cell morphology and function. We investigated the effects of CR on <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> morphology and expression of sweet taste–related modulators in 5 -, 17 -, and 30 -month-old rats. In ad libitum (AL) and CR rats, we consistently found the following parameters altered significantly with advancing age: reduction of <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> size and <b>taste</b> cell numbers per <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> and reduced expression of sonic hedgehog, type 1 taste receptor 3 (T 1 r 3), α-gustducin, and glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1). In the oldest rats, CR affected a significant reduc-tion of tongue T 1 r 3, GLP- 1, and α-gustducin expression compared with age-matched AL rats. Leptin receptor immuno...|$|R
40|$|Gustatory {{transduction}} {{mechanisms for}} sucrose and amino acid sweeteners in gerbil taste cells were studied with Ca 2 + imaging and whole cell recording techniques. A 100 mM sucrose stimulus with Ca 2 + increased the intracellular Ca concentration ([Ca]i) in sweet-sensitive taste {{cells of the}} <b>taste</b> <b>bud,</b> but the sucrose stimulus without Ca did not change the [Ca 2 +]i. A 10 mM D-phenylalanine sweet stimulus with or without Ca 2 + similarly increased the [Ca 2 +]i in the <b>taste</b> <b>bud.</b> The addition of 5 uM ionomysin, a Ca +-ionophore, without Ca 2 + greatly increased the [Ca]i in the <b>taste</b> <b>bud.</b> The application of 10 mM D-phenylalanine stimulus without Ca 2 + enhanced the outward K+ current in isolated taste cells. These results suggest that a sugar sweetener such as sucrose induces a depolarization in gerbil taste cells which activates voltage-dependent Ca channels and that a non-sugar sweetener such as D-phenylalanine releases Ca 2 + from the internal stores without a depolarization.

25|$|TRP {{channels}} that detect noxious stimuli (mechanical, thermal, and chemical pain) relay that info to nociceptors that generate an action potential. Mechanical TRP channels react to depression of their cells (like touch), thermal TRP change shape in different temperatures, and chemical TRP act like <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> signalling if their receptors bond to certain elements/chemicals.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lingual organoids are organoids that recapitulate, {{at least}} partly, {{aspects of the}} tongue physiology. Epithelial lingual organoids have been {{generated}} using BMI1 expressing epithelial stem cells in three-dimensional culture conditions through the manipulation of EGF, WNT, and TGF-β. [...] This organoid culture, however, lacks taste receptors, as these cells do not arise from Bmi1 expressing epithelial stem cells. Lingual <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> organoids containing <b>taste</b> cells, however, have been created using the LGR5+ or CD44+ stem/progenitor cells of circumvallate (CV) papilla tissue. These <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> organoids have been successfully created both directly from isolated Lgr5- or LGR6-expressing taste stem/progenitor cells.

50|$|The nerve fibrils {{after losing}} their {{medullary}} sheaths enter the <b>taste</b> <b>bud,</b> and end in fine extremities between the gustatory cells; other nerve fibrils ramify between the supporting cells and terminate in fine extremities; these, however, {{are believed to}} be nerves of ordinary sensation and not gustatory.|$|R
50|$|To {{depolarize}} the cell, {{and ultimately}} generate a response, the body uses different {{cells in the}} <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or umami. Downstream of the taste receptor, the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway. Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates phospholipase C to generate inositol trisphosphate (IP3), this subsequently opens the IP3-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This increase in intracellular calcium activates the TRPM5 channel and induces cellular depolarization. The ATP release channel CALHM1 gets activated by the depolarization and releases ATP neurotransmitter which activates the afferent neurons innervating the <b>taste</b> <b>bud.</b>|$|R

25|$|In addition, the {{analysis}} of saliva should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of taste receptors, including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor. Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry. Studies have shown that electron micrographs of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate pathological changes in the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} {{equipped}} with many <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> on its dorsal surface, and each taste bud {{is equipped with}} taste receptor cells that can sense particular classes of tastes. Distinct types of taste receptor cells respectively detect substances that are sweet, bitter, salty, sour, spicy, or taste of umami. Umami receptor cells are the least understood and accordingly are the type most intensively under research.|$|E
