5|$|General panic now {{seized the}} Allied army and it {{abandoned}} {{the field in}} all possible directions. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. French artillery pounded towards <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ice was broken due to the bombardment. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: {{there may have been}} as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes. However, local evidence, only later made public, suggests that Napoleon's account of the catastrophe may have been totally invented; on his instructions the lakes were drained {{a few days after the}} battle and the corpses of only two or three men, with some 150 horses, were found.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The British troops, realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, the American troops pushed on; driving the British troops beyond the fence {{to the top of a}} hill. When they reached the hill, the British forces received reinforcements; including some artillery. For two hours, the British troops held their ground at the top of the hill until the Americans once again forced them to retreat, into a buckwheat field where Barnard College now stands.|$|E

25|$|The unit saw heavy {{action in}} the Battle of Atlanta, where it lost many men. Colonel Baucum {{was shot in the}} face, while Lt. Col. Hutchison was wounded in the arm. Both being lost for many months, command devolved upon Major David H. Hamiter of the 19th Arkansas, who was to command the {{regiment}} until {{the final days of the}} war. At Jonesboro, 49 men of the 19th, and 77 men of the 8th were captured when Govan's Brigade was overrun by a massive Union attack. Only heroic fighting by the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of Cleburne's division saved the Confederate position from being destroyed. The flag of the consolidated 8th-19th was captured by an officer of the 74th Indiana Infantry Regiment during this fight.|$|E
25|$|This {{campaign}} was ultimately unsuccessful, although the local Timorese paid {{a high price}} for the assistance they provided the Australians: it is estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 Timorese perished during the Japanese occupation. In September, in an effort to maintain the pressure on the Japanese, the 2nd Independent Company was reinforced with the landing of the 2/4th Australian Independent Company. By late-November 1942, however, {{it was clear that the}} Australians could not sustain their campaign due to extreme ill-health amongst all <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ever-increasing number of Japanese reinforcements as well as reduced food supplies. Furthermore, the Japanese used increasing numbers of Dutch Timorese to wreak havoc among the Portuguese Timorese, who then found it impossible to keep helping the Australians. As a result, both the 2/2 and 2/4 were withdrawn from Timor between mid-December 1942 and January 1943, along with Portuguese civilians, some Dutch troops and Timorese who would later serve with Z Special Unit.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into the cubicles {{to make eye contact}} with the men but they are unable to return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|E
500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest fed to the now starving dogs. [...] "On the whole it was voted good" [...] wrote Mawson of the meat, [...] "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".|$|E

500|$|Moore {{wrote of}} the 52nd in his diary that [...] "it is evident that not only the officers, but that each {{individual}} soldier, knows perfectly {{what he has to}} do; the discipline is carried on without severity, the officers are attached to <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> men to the officers." [...] This {{had much to do with}} the method of training; unlike other regiments, light infantry officers drilled with the men and were expected to be familiar with drill routines, including weapons training. The ranks also received additional training, and were encouraged to develop initiative and self-direction; while skirmishing in the field they would need to react without direct orders. While most regiments of the time fought in tight formation, allowing easy administration of orders, light infantry worked in small groups, in advance of the main line, so complicated bugle calls were developed to pass orders. Consequently, the bugle became the emblem of the light infantry regiments.|$|E
500|$|In the {{meantime}} North enjoyed {{the status of}} a famous high society gentleman in Britain and was worth US$10 million in 1889. [...] He was a friend of the Prince of Wales, later to become Edward VII, and was described, by The New York Times as a [...] "lion" [...] of the London social season. [...] He was the owner of a [...] estate with extensive stables and a mansion, Avery Hill, near to Eltham in Kent. [...] North owned several racing horses and won several British racing trophies. [...] North visited the United States in July 1889 where he was described {{as a member of the}} nouveau riche and a [...] "Chilean Monte Cristo" [...] because of his recent rise to fame and fortune. [...] He became known as Colonel North as he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Tower Hamlets Regiment of Volunteer Engineers on 25 March 1885. [...] He regularly allowed the regiment of 250 men to camp in the gardens of his estate for three days at a time. [...] During this time he would hold festivals for <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> local villagers and at one of these events he challenged the Lieutenant-Colonel to a footrace and won.|$|E
