5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} N-body {{simulations}} {{have shown that}} the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass. In addition, due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity, some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster. Over long periods of time this will result in a dissipation of the cluster, a process termed evaporation. The typical <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> for the evaporation of a globular cluster is 1010 years. In 2010 it became possible to directly compute, star by star, N-body simulations of a globular cluster over the course of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Dust and {{possibly}} water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a {{process by which}} stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the Poynting–Robertson effect. At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> {{for all of the}} dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.|$|E

Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct {{at a time that}} coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game. The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore, and a descendant of one of those now-extinct wolf populations.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the <b>time</b> <b>scale</b> of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E

30|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problems of complete closedness of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> under translational and non-translational shifts. By introducing the algebraic structure of matched spaces attached with shift directions, some basic concepts of complete closedness of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> with different shift directions are introduced. Based on these, some new definitions of almost periodic functions and almost automorphic functions including their generalizations such as Δ-almost periodic functions and Δ-almost automorphic functions on irregular <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> are proposed. Moreover, some novel almost periodicity and almost automorphy of some functions under non-translational shift are proposed and studied, which would be impossible to be investigated on periodic <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> under translations before. The results established in this paper will mainly contribute to solving the problems of closedness of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> under non-translational shifts, which will be significant to studying functions on a more comprehensive scope of <b>time</b> <b>scales</b> such as the “quantum-like” <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> e.g., q^Z, (-q)^Z, -q^Z∪ q^Z and other irregular <b>time</b> <b>scales,</b> e.g., N_+^ 1 / 2, N_±^ 1 / 2, etc.|$|R
