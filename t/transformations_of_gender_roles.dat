The study <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and {{adaptive capacity}} {{in the context of}} climate change took place in the two villages in the Meatu district in Tanzania; Mwamanimba and Mwashata. Impacts of climate variability and change, like drought, inconsistent rainfall patterns, less reliable and shorter rain seasons, result in households having less access to water, decreased agricultural production and reduced access to food. This lead to additional pressure on already vulnerable households. Relations, structure and agency contribute to the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and determine people's adaptation strategies. The main findings are firstly, that the impacts of climate change, such as increased drought contribute to a change in household structures that has consequence for gender relations due to the slow process of the decrease of polygamous household structures. 	 Secondly, results identify a <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> due to women’s triple role and the heavy burden of increased responsibilities. With respect to climate change, the triple role of women is particularly a threat to women’s adaptive capacity and empowerment as the triple role increases household tasks, farm duties and community labor for women. Furthermore, a huge number of husbands escape the villages during drought and hunger crisis, and wives are left behind taking care of their children and the elderly. This is an event which threatens the women and the development of the village. 	The role of men are also changing, especially for the men in polygamous household structures due to the household structure's decrease.

40|$|This study {{gives an}} {{alternative}} view regarding the alienation of African women from technology. Proceeding with a careful analysis of development communication theories, both old and newer theories {{are seen as}} inadequate in clarifying the patterns of Third World development {{because they do not}} consider gender as a necessary variable in the development process. Present feminist theories of technology, particularly those in the Women in Development school (WID), are also viewed as inadequate in explaining the alienation of African women from technology, as they mainly point to economic and legal factors. This study posits that the process of technology transfer has to be considered {{in the context of the}} socio-cultural base of African societies, especially in relation to the sexual division of labour. Using Malawi as a case study, the study demonstrates that the main cause of African women's alienation from technology goes beyond mere economic and legal factors. African women's gender-roles confine them to routine, mostly unskilled chores. When advanced technologies are imported, the women are not prepared for the jobs generated by the new technologies, and do not have the chance to even use them. Thus the benefits of using new technologies are accrued almost exclusively by men.

Over time {{the meaning of the word}} parent has changed to reflect the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in society. The {{traditional}} embodiment of [...] "parents" [...] used to be that of a husband and wife, but now the definition has expanded beyond this single definition. The media has played a large role in the acceptance of these many definitions. By adjusting the parental definition, the definition of family structure has become more flexible as well. Media has presented a multitude of family structures and has promoted the acceptance of alternate family structures in many ways. The integration of alternate family structures has been presented in television, newspapers, movies, commercials, etc. Media can be a very convenient source of information, being both accessible and up to date. Media makes information readily available to those seeking advice and understanding about parenthood or other family structures. In spite of the advantages the media can provide, there are many drawbacks of projecting parenthood in the media. For example, a lot of media coverage on parenthood can be taken out of context, dishonest, and misleading. Few people can benefit from highlighting the failures of new parents, but media coverage thrives on controversy. In summary, parents {{are at the}} heart of every family and the way the media chooses to portray parents has a ripple effect.|$|R
40|$|Does gender {{matter in}} the context of immigration? What {{significance}} does it gain through time? Does transition from one <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> to another result in redistribution of family roles? These are the main questions which this paper addresses through scientific discourse and empiric research. In particular the paper deals with the question whether the transition from one <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> to another in the course of immigration triggers the liberalization <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in the families of East-European immigrants (from Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Armenia) in Germany. This is investigated through semi-structured biographical interviews with female immigrants to Germany conducted by the author in 2012 - 2014. The findings illustrate a specific shift <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> {{in the context of}} migration. On the one hand, willingly or through circumstances, immigrant {{women are more likely to}} be involved in the decision-making process, to adapt to a breadwinner role, and to undertake the communication functions with official institutions (often due to better language proficiency). On the other hand, men are more likely to be more engaged in the caregiver roles for offspring, to maintain native language in communication with children (from mother tongue to ‘father tongue’), and to fulfill housekeeping duties. These patterns are rather untypical for post-soviet <b>gender</b> <b>roles,</b> with their increasing tendency to the renaissance <b>of</b> traditional <b>gender</b> <b>roles.</b> The question <b>of</b> whether a shift in <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> related to migration from one country to another leads towards the greater liberalization <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> still remains debatable. But migration experience reinforces the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> which initially are not only distinct but also unequal. Thus, migration can accelerate restructuring <b>of</b> the <b>gender</b> relationship. In turn, a new social order imposes – on immigrants – a demand for greater flexibility <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in the family and for diversity in household strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{data are}} in; {{women are still}} insignificant. Even {{after more than a}} decade of {{experience}} with UNSCR 1325, women have made only insignificant gains in peace processes. While the UN has repeatedly renewed its commitment to “mainstream” gender, most notably with its Millennium Goals and the creation of UN Women, all of these exhortations have thus far counted for little. The lens of this paper is focused on the conflict and post conflict terrain, because it, in theory at least, provides multiple opportunities for transformation on many different levels – including accountability for human rights violations committed during hostilities, reforming local and national laws, reintegration of soldiers, rehabilitation and redress for victims, the establishment or re-establishment of the rule of law, the creation of human rights institutions and new governance structures, alteration of cultural attitudes, the improvement of socioeconomic conditions and <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and women’s status.

Poems of Nigâr Hanım were mostly analysed {{in the light of}} the aesthetic measures of Ottoman classical literature and Western literature. However, Nigâr Hanım may also be regarded as the first female poet who produces a feminine discourse by unveiling her female identity in the limits <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles.</b> In this study, feminine discourse was discussed in Nigâr Hanım‘s poems. First of all, the whole texts of Nigâr Hanım was transliterated into the new alphabet except for her play called Tesir-i Aşk (Impression of Love) and diaries. Nigâr Hanım published three books collecting her lyrical poems which are Efsûs: Birinci Kısım (Alas! [First Part]), Efsûs: İkinci Kısım (Alas! [Second Part]) and Aks-i Seda (Echo of Voice). These texts are the primary sources of this thesis project. In the first part, the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and social status of women in the nineteenth century Ottoman society and the views of various intellectuals were discussed. In the second part, the universality of postmodern feminist approaches, especially gynocriticism were questioned and a new, alternative approach was offered by searching feminine discourse in poems of Nigâr Hanım. Hence, poems of Nigâr Hanım were read comparatively with male poets writing during the same period, who are Recaizâde Mahmut Ekrem (1847 - 1914), Abdülhak Hâmid Tarhan (1852 - 1937), Celâl Sâhir (1883 - 1935) and Cenab ġahabeddin (1870 - 1934).

40|$|Where do the {{opportunities}} for gendered institutional change lay in post conflict transitional states? In particular, what processes explain the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> within traditionally male-dominated sectors such as security? The post-conflict South African State provides the institutional backdrop against which the <b>gender</b> equality gains <b>of</b> women in the security sector are explored. The rare opportunities presented in the transitional context are {{a key factor in}} understanding the promises and limits <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> change within the institutional arena, both in terms of the descriptive and substantive representation of women. This thesis explores the processes <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> institutional change from a feminist institutional perspective, incorporating a range of normatively nuanced variables that examine the mechanisms by which socially-constructed gender norms are altered within the security sector, situating power {{at the heart of the}} contextually driven analysis. The thesis argues that the paths which emerged over the course of the liberation struggle as a result of three key historical legacies enabled a <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and institutional norms with respect to security. Specifically, the intertwined legacies of an equality-based liberation movement, the continuous increase in women’s autonomy, and the legacy of militarisation all contributed to the opening of spaces for women’s strategic action. Through process tracing methodology, the thesis reveals how South African women strategically wielded their power to consolidate gender gains embedded within the foundational documents of the new democratic regime. In so doing, women capitalised on a range of timeous exogenous influences within the broader feminist movement, particularly the global shift towards institutionally-focused gender mainstreaming strategies. The focus on the security sector is viewed as a litmus test for the advancement <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> equality within the institutional structures of South Africa, given the rigidly patriarchal and masculine norms permeating the security arena. Among the contextual considerations which produced openings for the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> State security structures was the adoption of the human security paradigm, which called for a holistic, people centred vision of security centred around development and stability. The resulting overhaul of the security sector, and the repositioning of the South African military on the national and regional stage, presented further opportunities for strategic interventions by women to transform the institutional culture of the State security structures. Bolstered by exogenous influences such as innovative regional and international instruments and organisations, a new military culture began emerging in South Africa, with women positioned to play a central role in its development. The manner in which women engaged with this process is a demonstration of the extent to which gendered norms have become entrenched in the institutional structures of the post-conflict South African State, revealing the constraints of inherited structures, and the power of institutional layering in restructuring women’s security roles within the State. The successes and failures <b>of</b> the <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> the security sector are embodied within the complex case of the arms acquisition. This example is analysed as a “case study within a case study”, and clearly highlights the intersection of the multiple variables discussed in the thesis, revealing the manner in which evolving institutional norms promote and foreclose gendered change, and the implications of the struggle between old and new gendered legacies. The infusion <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> norms into the security sector is also considered through the perceptions of government and civil society respondents, as an indicator of the “stickiness” <b>of</b> the <b>gender</b> equality rhetoric, and of the progress made towards transforming the masculine domain of the security arena. The unique attributes of the South African case yields insights into {{the opportunities}} and constraints of post-conflict institutional change, contributing to the broader feminist institutional literature through the focus on the complex processes <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> institutional change and continuity within the overlooked security structures of the State...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{changing}} male - and father identity - has become relevant alongside {{with the large}} transformations in contemporary society (demographic shifts, changings in the labour market, <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> and family structures…). So, the traditional differentiation {{between male and female}} tasks and responsibility (men more related to the work domain and women to the private home) is no longer sustainable and needs to be reconsidered. Several empirical studies highlight, in fact, a <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the father role, both in Italy and in the wider international context, which implies a “more involved” and “new” father style. Nevertheless, the strong relation with job remain a pivotal trait shaping men identity, especially in Italy. In this context, the paper is aimed to present findings from a research on working fathers, conduced in Italy between April 2010 and February 2011 aimed to understand how men consider their parental role in relation with their work. The hypothesis that guides this research is that the expression of father's role and the father identity are strongly influenced by the workplace (company culture, the representation of men as fathers and the reconciliations measures) as well as the maternal role. In particular, 3 company-case studies has been carried out, using a qualitative research techniques, with interviewsboth at managerial level and at employees level. In total, 45 interviews has been done: semi-structured interviews with managers focused on corporate culture and narrative interviews with employees (fathers with young children) focused on the transition to fatherhood.

40|$|Energy {{poverty in}} the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa {{is one of the main}} {{barriers}} that hinder development. In Tanzania there have been numerous efforts to enable the rural poor access clean and modern sources of energy but these have had limited results. The major reason is that current top-down approaches fail to benefit the energy poor. Decentralized off-grid renewable energy technologies promoted through a bottom-up approach which empowers the poor giving them the responsibility to choose, apply and adapt technology to their communities is increasingly seen as a viable alternative. In 2011 a solar project under the Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation program was introduced in two remote, un-electrified rural villages in northern Tanzania; Lingeka and Nyanza. This project introduced solar home systems and solar lanterns in these villages and using a barefoot approach trained four women to become barefoot solar engineers, established a village energy committee and a rural energy workshop. In addition the project used an innovative social entrepreneurship business model that allowed the residents to payback for the solar equipment in installments. This money was then used to buy more solar equipment to be sold. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, this study examines the socioeconomic impact of the project, how the project impacts empowerment of the women solar engineers and examines the success factors and challenges of the model used to promote solar PV. The study finds that access to affordable solar PV electricity has also enabled households to light up their small business and earn extra income by charging mobile phones for a fee. Pupils in this homes study 1 - 4 hours more after dark have improved grades. Residents of these villages have also better security at night and are less prone to health hazards associated with kerosene lamps. The study also finds that the solar project has contributed to <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and empowered the four female barefoot solar engineers. These women have not only transformed their villages by providing crucial after sale services but also improved their agency, well being and status in the community. In solving energy poverty, modern technology is only one piece of the puzzle. Innovative models bridge the gap between solar PV technology and the rural energy poor, as demonstrated by the Lingeka-Nyanza model. This model overcomes major technical, social and institutional Barriers that have hindered absorption of solar technology in rural areas by establishing an innovative locally adapted model. Through its innovative social entrepreneurship model, it offers a practical sustainable solution that promises great potential for providing other rural villages with access to solar PV electricity. This study recommends this model to be scaled up as one solution to energy poverty in rural Tanzania. M-D...|$|R

People’s identities in the diaspora can be regarded as a constant process of negotiation between the traditions of their homeland and the traditions of the host society. This paper investigates the relationship between ideologies of male domination and Sudanese women’s actual status in the family and society.

Despite successes in the roll out of HIV treatment programmes, HIV prevention programmes have been less successful in lowering incidence rates. Certain groups have been found to experience significantly higher prevalence than seen in the general population, with fishing communities representing one key group with significantly higher risk of HIV infection. In fishing communities, gender power relations and economic vulnerability intersect in ways that mean that individuals are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. In the past decade, there has increasingly been a focus on structural drivers of HIV transmission such as gender power relations. Gender differences are fundamentally underpinned by power inequalities in society and can result in the subordination of women and their interests in a manner that favours men. This thesis set out to understand how gendered structural drivers shaped vulnerability to HIV in fishing communities, and to develop interventions to address these structural drivers. The research was conducted in two fishing communities in the rural district of Mangochi in Southern Malawi. The design of the study drew on social relations theory and second-wave feminism. The research methodology used qualitative and participatory methods to address four key research objectives: (1) to understand gender power relations in fishing communities in Southern Malawi; (2) to explore and document the key drivers and facilitators of participation in transactional sex in the study villages; (3) to document individual and community perceptions of HIV risk and transactional sex in the study villages; (4) to develop a HIV prevention strategy to address risk of HIV/AIDS among fishing communities in southern Lake Malawi. Key findings are that in fishing communities, transactional sex was common and took a variety of forms, ranging from gift-giving within relationships, to-sex-for fish exchanges, to sex worker encounters. Power differences between couples in transactional sexual encounters shaped individuals’ abilities to negotiate condom use. The context and motivations for transactional sex varied and were mediated by economic need and social position both of men and women. Microfinance is a tool that can alleviate poverty and potentially prevent HIV. However, in the fishing context microfinance loan repayment procedures often increased female fish traders’ vulnerability to HIV. Participants had a good understanding of HIV risk yet this did not result in the adoption of risk-reduction strategies. Building on these findings, the thesis presents suggested HIV interventions that were developed through participatory community workshops. Interventions identified included: working with men and boys to support <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and normative behaviour; enforcing legislation to improve the ecological environment to reduce the impact of decline fish stocks and environmental hazards on risk-taking behaviour; improving access to HIV testing and treatment services; and improving living and working conditions of men and women working in the fishing industry. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the urgent need to introduce structural interventions in fishing communities in Southern Malawi and provides clear recommendations for implementing potential interventions...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on work-life balance (WLB) {{dimension}} in the actual post Fordist labor market, characterized by increased deregulation and flexibility which have made workers’ life trajectories more insecure and unpredictable. The {{review of the literature}} on WLB (Crompton, 2006; Scott et al., 2008) leads to consider the topic from a gender perspective within the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>gender</b> <b>role</b> models in society and in families, rejecting the idea, given by the historical strong gendered division between paid work and unpaid care work, that WLB is a “women’s issue” (Ransome, 2007). The theme is analyzed in a capability perspective (Sen, 1984; 1985; Nussbaum, 2000) where WLB becomes a quality of life issue for considering “substantive freedoms to choose the life one has reason to value” (Sen 1999 : 74). In such a perspective, the reconciliation policies (EC, 2005) should aim at promoting an equality of capabilities, i. e. a combination of functioning that reflects the freedom of a person to lead one type of life instead of another. The Senian approach is applied to evaluate the effects of the Italian WLB policies on individual working lives trajectories, presenting the results of a qualitative research involving a sample of young adult Italian “flexible” couples, i. e. where one of the partner or both, aged between 25 and 45, has/have a short time contract job, married or cohabitant, with or without children. The research considers several central dimensions to a capabilities framework for WLB, including working times, flexibility, employment situation, job security and perceived economic well being, taking into account differences among people in education, age and partner’s work hours (Hobson & Fahlén, 2009). The results show different strategies adopted by male and female to combine working and family duties and how their capabilities to WLB are limited or enhanced by systemic aspects like public services, companies’ policies and the particular Italian “familistic” Welfare State (Esping-Andersen, 2002), as well by meso factors like the presence and quality of supporting family networks (Gallino, 2001). Finally, the paper indicates some types of WLB policies that should be implemented in order to tackle the emerging difficulties in balancing work and family life as well to avoid the strengthening <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequalities in social and labor spheres rather than diminishing them (Hardy & Adnett, 2002) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the final}} {{decade of the}} nineteenth-century, when New Zealand women began riding the bicycle, they excited intense public debate about {{contemporary}} middle-class ideals of femininity. The research question posed is: "why did women's cycling provoke such a strong outcry?" Three nineteenth-century cycling magazines, the New Zealand Wheelman, the New Zealand Cyclist, and the New Zealand Cyclists' Touring Club Gazette, were examined, along with numerous New Zealand and British contemporary sources on women's sport and recreation, etiquette, femininity, and <b>gender</b> <b>roles.</b> The context <b>of</b> the late-nineteenth century signifies a high point in the modernisation of Western capitalist societies, which is characterised in part by significant and widespread change in the roles of middle-class women. The bicycle {{was a product of}} modern ideas, designs, and technology, and eventually came to symbolise freedom in diverse ways. The dual-purpose nature of the bicycle (i. e., as a mode of transport and as a recreational tool) enabled women to become more physically and geographically mobile, as well as to pursue new directions in leisure. It afforded, moreover, increasing opportunities to meet and socialise with a wider range of male acquaintances, free from the restrictions of etiquette and the requirements of chaperonage. As a symbol of the 'New Woman', the bicycle graphically represented a threat to the proprieties governing the behaviour and movements of respectable middle-class women in public. The debates which arose in response to women's cycling focused on their conduct, their appearance, and the effects of cycling on their physical and moral well-being. Ultimately, these debates highlighted competing definitions of nineteenth-century middle-class femininity. Cycling presented two dilemmas for respectable women: how could they cycle and retain their respectability? and, should a respectable woman risk damaging herself, physically and morally, for such a capricious activity as cycling? Cyclists aspired to reconcile the ignominy of their conspicuousness on the bicycle with the social imperative to maintain an impression of middleclass respectability in public. The conceptual framework of Erving Goffman's dramaturgical perspective is used to interpret the nature of heterosocial interactions between cyclists and their audiences. Nineteenth-century feminine propriety involved a set of performances, with both performers (cyclists) and audiences (onlookers) possessing shared understandings of how signals (impressions) ought to be given and received. Women on bicycles endeavoured to manage the impressions they gave off by carefully attending to their appearances and their behaviour, so that the audience would be persuaded to view them as respectable, despite the perception that riding a bicycle in public was risqué. In this way, women on bicycles attempted to redefine middle-class femininity. Women on bicycles became a highly visible, everyday symbol of the realities of modem life that challenged traditional <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> and nineteenth-century formality. Cycling for New Zealand women in the 1890 s thus played a key part in the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> nineteenth-century <b>gender</b> <b>roles...</b>|$|R

Hipoteza koju testiraju jest: proces individualizacije zahvatio je i hrvatsko društvo i odražava se na promjene uloga spolova u društvu. Ta se hipoteza potvrdila. No, društvo nije homogeno individualizirano. Mlade žene, u dobi od 18 do 24 godine, pokazuju značajno veći stupanj individualiziranosti od ostatka populacije. U razvoju individualizacije, za koju autori smatraju da je proces koji se ne može zaustaviti, autori naglašavaju mogućnost personalizacije, pronalaženja novog ekvilibrija među spolovima u horizontu nepovredivog dostojanstva ljudske osobe, čije utemeljenje autori izvode iz judeokršćanskog učenja o čovjeku stvorenom, kao »muško« i »žensko« na Božju sliku. The authors emphasise {{that gender}} {{is not only}} a {{biological}} category and not only biologically conditioned, but that various social connotations and interpretations <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in society need to be borne in mind. The idea of equality of the sexes develops on the basis of Judeo-Christian teachings about man, »male« and »female« created in the image of God, from which, the authors stress, develops the concept of human dignity and human rights. The basic hypothesis that they are testing is: the process of individualisation has firmly caught hold of Croatian society and influenced changes in <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in society. Results of research carried out in Croatia were compared to results of research carried out in other European countries in 1991 - the European Value Study project (EVS) -with particular attention paid to France and Ireland. Research is done {{on the basis of a}} questionnaire that has been standardised for all counties participating in EVS- 99. The first variable that is analysed relates to the employment of mothers with children. 73. 5 % of Croatians state that a working mother is equally able to establish a quality relationship with her child as is a mother who does not work. The same percentage was found in France in 1990 (72 %). In Croatia, the percentage of those agreeing with the above statement is significantly higher among women, particularly women in the 18 to 24 age group (90. 3 %). The second statement is that a preschool aged child will suffer if his mother works. 55. 6 % of respondents agree with this statement, although for women in the 18 to 24 age group the percentage agreeing is only 36 %. 54. 7 % of respondents agree with the statement that what women really want is a home and children, while for men across all age groups the percentage is 60 %. For women the percentage varies according to age group; 79. 6 % of women over 55 agree with the statement, compared to 38. 4 % of women between the ages of 18 and 24. Next is the statement that the work of a housewife is as fulfilling as paid employment. 45, 3 % of respondents agree with this statement, about 50 % of men across all age groups, about 60 % of women over 55, and 36 % of women between 18 and 24 years of age, 73. 6 % of respondents agree with the statement that employment is the best way for a woman to be independent. The percentage is over 80 % for female respondents across all age groups, while for male respondents the percentage varies according to age group. It is interesting to note that young respondents more rarely agree that employment is necessary for a woman to be independent. The greatest level of agreement was with the statement that for houshold upkeep both spouses need to work, and there were no differences according to gender. 94. 4 % of respondents agree with the statement. 68. 3 % of respondents agree with the statement that fathers are equally capable of taking care of children, with a greater percentage of men agreeing than women. Women also more often agree that men are less capable of controlling their emotions in interpersonal relations. It has been noted that men consider themselves equally competent to women in traditional female roles, and that women consider themselves equally competent to men in traditional male roles. This inversion indicates that the process <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> is not yet complete. Regarding religiosity, results show that women over 25 go to church more often than men, while this percentage evens out far the 18 to 24 age group. Abortion for a woman who is unmarried is approved of by between 50 and 60 % depending on the age group, while among women the percentage grows to 68 % for the 18 to 24 age group. Abortion for a couple who do not want more children is approved of by 45 - 50 % of men, and 55 - 60 % of women. Among those who attend church at least once a week, abortion for a young girl that gets pregnant is approved of by 39. 5 % of men and 36 % of women. For the 18 to 24 age group, 48 % of men approve, and 49 % of women. Abortion for a couple not wanting more children is approved of by 31, 6 % of men and 29. 4 % of women believers, and the percentages far the 18 to 24 age group, 37 % if men approve, and 39. 4 % of women. These figures are quite high considering that they refer to practising believers, those who could be counted among »core members«. With respect to political preferences, women more often more highly value equality, and men freedom. Finally, the authors conclude that men across all age groups are more strongly under the influence of traditional views <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles</b> in society, while among women there has been a notable shift in the direction of individualisation. With respect to <b>gender</b> <b>roles,</b> young women demonstrate a significantly higher degree of individualisation than the rest of Croatian society, even than their male peers. They conclude that the proposed hypothesis regarding the influence of the process of individualisation on Croatian society is confirmed. This process has taken hold of Croatian society in various dynamics and levels of intensity. This influence is most evident among young women between the ages of 18 and 24. The authors stress the need for the process of individualisation to be followed by the process of personalisation, in order to avoid falling once again into collectivism based on new principles...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides a}} comparative overview <b>of</b> the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> regulations in two federal countries, Germany and Switzerland, drawing upon federalist analysis and gender regime approaches. Both countries have witnessed important legislative reforms towards gender equality {{from the end}} of the 1990 ’s. Mobilizing a multiscalar analytical grid, we situate this shift within the broader context of a social historical <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> regimes that articulates changes in the relations between public and private regulation as well as between different territorial levels. We demonstrate how the federalist privacy deadlock, historically characterizing both countries, has been overcome. Nevertheless, in the field of childcare, the multiscalar grid reveals that both countries follow different trajectories towards equality. In Germany, top-down regulation has eventually supplanted bottom-up processes and there is a modest influence of public regulation over the definition <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>roles.</b> Such changes were not achieved via a similar mode in Switzerland...|$|R
