5|$|During this time, Stuart's {{execution}} {{had been}} delayed on multiple occasions. On 6 July, Playford and the Executive Council {{decided not to}} reprieve Stuart, and he was due to be executed the next day, but {{an appeal to the}} Privy Council in London stalled proceedings again. However, this also failed. Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall <b>the</b> <b>hanging.</b>|$|E
5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where is God? Where is he? Not heavy enough for {{the weight of his}} body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E

5|$|On April 19, 1998, a fire {{broke out}} in the main {{building}} of the monastery complex, which contained valuable paintings, artifacts and statues. The fire {{is believed to have been}} caused by electrical short-circuiting or flickering butter lamps lighting <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> tapestries. A monk also died during the fire. The restoration works were undertaken at an estimated cost of 135 million ngultrum. The Government of Bhutan and the then King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, oversaw the restoration of the damaged monastery and its contents in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Winged gods, other mythological creatures, {{and birds}} are {{frequently}} depicted on cylinder seals and steles from the 3rd millennium {{all the way}} to the Assyrians. Both two-winged and four-winged figures are known and the wings are most often extended to the side. Spread wings are part of one type of representation for Ishtar. However, the specific depiction of <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> wings of the nude goddess may have evolved from what was originally a cape.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. He attended <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> of abolitionist leader John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he abruptly decided to join the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's hanging, to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired the condemned man's bravery in facing death stoically.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{service as}} sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell {{described}} {{the time in}} office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who {{had been convicted of}} murdering his mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about <b>the</b> <b>hanging,</b> Cleveland executed Morrissey himself; he hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.|$|E

5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> {{of one of}} Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G.

60|$|To pass undetected {{through this}} hive of enemies {{appeared}} quite beyond {{the range of}} possibility.

A moment later his head disappeared within; then his shoulders, and his lithe body, and <b>the</b> <b>hangings</b> dropped quietly into place again.

5|$|The Northwest again saw unrest. Many of the Manitoban Métis {{had moved}} into the territories. Negotiations between the Métis and the Government to settle grievances over land rights proved difficult, Riel had lived in exile in the United States since 1870, he journeyed to Regina with the {{connivance}} of Macdonald's government, who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with. Instead, the Métis rose the following year under Riel in the North-West Rebellion. Macdonald put down the rebellion with militia troops transported by rail, and Riel was captured, tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Macdonald refused to consider reprieving Riel, who was of uncertain mental health. <b>The</b> <b>hanging</b> of Riel proved bitterly controversial, and alienated many Quebecers (like Riel, Catholic and culturally French Canadian) from the Conservatives—they soon realign themselves with the Liberals.|$|E
5|$|This {{artificial}} lake {{is connected to}} {{the east side of the}} Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west. The canal was about 20 meter wide and there are two bottlenecks that are thought to be the place where a hanging bridge once stood. One of the bridge is now located in the street that connects the kraton complex of Magangan with the Kamandhungan Kidul. The layout of the bridge can still be recognized, although the bridge itself has gone.

That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing <b>the</b> <b>hanging</b> fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E

60|$|It {{was evident}} then {{to him that}} she was betraying him, and without further loss of time he turned his back toward <b>the</b> <b>hangings</b> and {{commenced}} a rapid examination of his hiding place. In the alcove the man and the girl whispered, and then cautiously and with great stealth, the man rose and drew his curved saber. On tiptoe he approached <b>the</b> <b>hangings,</b> <b>the</b> girl creeping at his side. Neither spoke now, nor was there any sound in the room as the girl sprang forward and with outstretched arm and pointing finger indicated a point upon the curtain at the height of a man's breast.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Oxburgh <b>Hangings</b> are {{needlework}} hangings {{that are}} held in Oxburgh Hall, made by Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick. <b>The</b> <b>hangings</b> were made between the years 1570 and approximately 1585. An accomplished needlewoman, Bess of Hardwick joined Mary at Chatsworth House for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on <b>the</b> <b>hangings.</b> At that time Mary was imprisoned, {{in the custody of}} the Earl of Shrewsbury. The hangings' design was devised at her request. <b>The</b> Oxburgh <b>Hangings</b> consist of green velvet hangings, each with a square centerpiece with octagonal panels of emblems of plants and animals surrounding it. <b>The</b> <b>hangings</b> have been made into a wall hanging, two bed curtains and a valance, although these were probably not the original arrangement of the needlework, but instead most likely an arrangement sewn together in the late 17th century. [...] There is also a group of 33 embroideries which are the remains of another <b>hanging.</b> <b>The</b> panels in <b>the</b> <b>hangings,</b> of which there are over a hundred, were made in cross stitch on canvas and applied to a green velvet background, and the designs of the panels were mostly based on four continental emblem books which Mary had; the panel designs were copied from wood-cut illustrations by well-known authors such as Claud Paradin, Conrad Gessner, and Pierre Belon. Some of the panels' emblems include a phoenix (the symbol of Mary's mother Marie of Guise), and a dragon and a unicorn. The panels made by Mary have her monogram, the letters MA superimposed on the Greek letter phi, and the panels made by Bess have the initials ES.|$|R
