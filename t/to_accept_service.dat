Except once, in the winter of 1917, when a purist might have {{condemned}} a certain mayonnaise of hers as lacking in creaminess. But one must make allowances. There had been several air-raids about that time, and no doubt the poor woman was shaken. But nothing is perfect in this world, Mr. Wooster, and I have had my cross to bear. For seven years I have lived in constant apprehension lest some evilly-disposed person might lure her from my employment. To my certain knowledge she has received offers, lucrative offers, <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> elsewhere. You may judge of my dismay, Mr. Wooster, when only this morning the bolt fell. She gave notice!" ...|$|E
50|$|Air Materiel Command's {{mission at}} the airport was <b>to</b> <b>accept,</b> <b>service</b> and {{coordinate}} the transfer of newly produced Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers to other installations. In addition, Ferrying Division, Air Transport Command's 4156th AAF Base Unit (Air Base) was organized. The new base unit had the mission of servicing, dispatching, and maintaining transient and locally based aircraft. The working personnel were entirely civilian, with a few officers in supervisory capacities.|$|E
50|$|On January 18, 2006, it was {{reported}} that the prosecutors had decided to charge Lozano with murder. The prosecutors indicated that despite making over twenty formal requests to the United States, they refused to formally identify Lozano. After confirming Lozano's identity, the Magistrate service appointed an attorney to represent Lozano during the charging process, with Lozano facing trial in absentia {{in the event of a}} failure <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> of process and non-appearance at trial.|$|E
30|$|This event {{indicates}} {{arrival of}} a new service for an UE. Whenever a service arrival event occurs, the event handler executes the CAC module. Then, the CAC module determines whether <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the <b>service,</b> based {{on the type of}} the new service and current system status. If the CAC module decides <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the <b>service,</b> the simulator successively generates initial and second packet arrival and service departure events for the <b>accepted</b> <b>service,</b> and next service arrival event based on predefined service arrival rate (λ), and put those events into the event queue. Conversely, if the CAC module declines the new service, the event handler only generates the next service arrival event and finishes handler operations after putting the event in the event queue.|$|R

50|$|Retainer is {{the basis}} of {{authority}} for an advocate. It limits the authority because it is not for all general purposes for all time. It is therefore specific in nature, e.g. during litigation the advocate is authorized by the client <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> of proceedings that do not require personal service on behalf of the client. This kind of authority can be expressed, implied, apparent or usual through the usual practice of the advocate while pursuing the instructions of the client.|$|E
50|$|A U. S. District Court in Los Angeles {{awarded the}} Associated Press a $3,780 {{judgement}} against Press-Courier publisher, Dan W. Emmett, on June 20, 1942, {{for attempting to}} withdraw from the A.P. without giving two year's notice as required by the association's bylaws. Judge Leon R. Yankwich stated that when Emmett refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> and, without notice, failed to pay his weekly assessment, he became liable for 104 weeks assessments in a lump sum based on the rate Emmett paid in May 1940 when he entered the contract.|$|E
50|$|Wichita Army Airfield (now McConnell Air Force Base) {{is located}} at the site of Wichita's {{original}} municipal airport, which shared a runway with the Boeing Aircraft Wichita facility. Boeing produced B-29 Superfortresses at Wichita and the USAAF Air Materiel Command took over control of the airport in 1942 <b>to</b> <b>accept,</b> <b>service</b> and coordinate the transfer of newly produced aircraft to other installations. It was returned to civilian jurisdiction in 1946 as Wichita Municipal Airport. It was reacquired by the United States Air Force in 1951 and became McConnell AFB.|$|E

60|$|The {{physician}} {{was sent}} for. He thought so seriously {{of the change}} in the patient, that he obliged Regina <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the <b>services</b> of a professed nurse. When Mr. Melton started on his return journey the next morning, he left his friend in a high fever.|$|R
60|$|He {{accompanied}} {{these words}} {{with the appropriate}} action, and {{in less than a}} minute, by setting up, his moustaches and his hair, he seemed a different person from him that had but now entered the room. Still, however, Tressilian hesitated <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> his <b>services,</b> and the artist became proportionably urgent.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Kiel in January 1814 {{separated}} Norway from Denmark, leaving Norway with a navy {{of seven}} brigs (one {{of which was}} laid up) {{and a number of}} smaller craft. A number of naval officers refused <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> in the new Norwegian navy until released by the Danish king to whom they had sworn loyalty. Those who joined the Norwegian navy were eventually struck off the Danish lists. Many others obeyed Danish orders and returned to Denmark. Lütken, of the Langeland, was briefly arrested when he refused to hand over the ship to the newly constituted Norwegian State.|$|E
50|$|During the {{consulate}} and empire, he practised medicine in Lyons {{under the name}} of Roland, and was awarded a gold medal for the propagation of vaccine. An accusation of complicity in the conspiracy of 1800-1801 was speedily retracted, but in 1806 Napoleon consented to refund Neuville's confiscated estate on condition that he should go to the United States. De Neuville settled near New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his house became a place of refuge for French exiles. In 1813 he was instrumental in helping his friend, General Moreau <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> in the army of the emperor of Russia. He returned to France after the replacement of the French Empire by the 1814 Bourbon Restoration.|$|E

40|$|In a time {{of fiscal}} cutback, {{analysis}} of program costs can help decision makers allocate resources. This paper {{presents the results of}} an economic cost evaluation of a countywide universal home visiting program to reduce child abuse and neglect. Results indicate that the average cost amounted to $ 4, 378 /family/year. This includes an average of 2. 1 visits by a Public Health Nurse and 29 home visits by Family Visitors. The full cost of professional services appeared to be significantly higher than that of paraprofessionals. Families with more risk factors were more likely <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>services</b> than families with fewer risk factors. These findings can be helpful in planning the costs associated with similar program implementation. cost analysis; home program; child abuse and neglect...|$|R
30|$|It is {{the view}} of the ESR that {{informed}} consent can only be obtained if the patient is informed at the site of imaging that their images may be interpreted through a teleradiology service. In addition, the patient should be informed of all the above provisions, including the reporting radiologist’s qualifications, prior to their agreement <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the <b>service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In some instances, {{delivery}} to {{an agent for}} acceptance of service or [...] "registered agent" [...] can substitute for personal service on the principal party to be served. The Registered Agent is a person or company authorized in advance <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> {{on behalf of the}} served party. For example, most corporations are required by local law to maintain a local agent of record for acceptance of service in each jurisdiction where they actively conduct business with the public. The identity of the agent for service can usually be ascertained by searching company filings with appropriate state corporate records or business registration agencies (often the business entity division of a state's Secretary of State. Generally, these business registration records are searchable by the public on the Secretary of State's website.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{after the}} {{publication}} of an article of an interview with Chee Soon Juan, party leader of the Singapore Democratic Party, on Singapores prime minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father and minister mentor, Lee Kuan Yew, Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong both sued the publication for defamation, alleging the magazine had suggested they were corrupt. The Singapore government banned the sale and distribution of the journal. In 2007, during the International Bar Associations Rule of Law symposium, then-Deputy Prime Minister, S. Jayakumar, states that FEER did not satisfy regulations for foreign publications in Singapore such as appointing a representative <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> of any notice or legal process, and submitting a security deposit. The lack of compliance to the regulations led to FEER not being able to circulate its publication in Singapore and was not due to the legal suit.|$|E

50|$|Greenstreet {{was born}} into a family of {{officers}} in the merchant navy of the British Empire; his father Herbert Edward Greenstreet had been granted captain's papers by the New Zealand Shipping Company. At age 15, Greenstreet became a sea cadet, never returning to school. He gained his Master's certificate in 1911. As a young ship's officer, he wrote to the Captain of the Endurance, Frank Worsley in 1914, asking to be considered for a berth. His request arrived just as the ship's named First Officer had thrown up his papers <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> in World War I, which had just broken out. Greenstreet was told to report to the Endurance in Plymouth Sound for an interview; and upon arrival, after brief inspection by Worsley he was abruptly told that the position of First Officer was his and that he had twenty-four hours to prepare for the departure of the vessel to the Southern Ocean. The fledgling ship's officer recalled that after considerable effort he had settled his affairs and reported aboard the ship, which then sailed 30 minutes after his arrival.|$|E
5000|$|Personal {{service is}} {{service of process}} {{directly}} to the (or a) party named on the summons, complaint, or petition. In most lawsuits in the United States, personal service is required to prove service. Most states allow substituted service in almost all lawsuits unless you are serving a corporation, LLC, LLP, or other business entity; in those cases, personal service must be achieved by serving (in hand) the documents to the [...] "Registered Agent" [...] of a business entity. Some states, e.g. Florida, do not require that the documents actually be handed to the individual. In California and most other states, the documents must be visible to the person being served, i.e., not in a sealed envelope. If the individual refuses <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service,</b> flees, closes the door, etc., and the individual has been positively identified as the person to be served, the documents may be [...] "drop served" [...] (placed {{as close to the}} individual as possible); this is considered a valid service. Personal service of process has been the hallmark for initiating litigation for nearly 100 years, primarily because it guarantees actual notice to a defendant of a legal action against him or her. Personal service of process remains the most reliable and efficacious way to both ensure compliance with constitutionally imposed due process requirements of notice to a defendant and the opportunity to be heard.|$|E
5000|$|The Statute of Labourers, {{passed in}} the fifth year of Elizabeth I of England's reign (1562), {{as well as the}} poor law of the same year, was to a {{considerable}} extent both a consolidating and an amending code of law, and was so securely based on public opinion and deeply rooted custom that it was maintained in force for two centuries. It avowedly approves of principles and aims in earlier acts, regulating wages, punishing refusal to work, and preventing free migration of labour. It makes, however, a great advance in its express aim of protecting the poor labourer against insufficient wages, and of devising a machinery, by frequent meeting of justices, which might yield [...] "unto the hired person both in time of scarcity and in time of plenty a convenient proportion of wages." [...] Minute regulations were made governing the contract between master and servant, and their mutual rights and obligations on parallel lines for (a) artificers, (b) labourers in husbandry. Hiring was to be by the year, and any unemployed person qualified in either calling was bound <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>service</b> on pain of imprisonment, if required, unless possessed of property of a specified amount or engaged in art, science or letters, or being a [...] " [...] gentleman." [...] Persons leaving a service were bound to obtain a testimonial, and might not be taken into fresh employment without producing such testimonial, or, if in a new district, until after showing it to the authorities of the place. A master might be fined or a labourer imprisoned, and if contumacious, whipped, for breach of this rule. The carefully devised scheme for technical training of apprentices embodied to a considerable extent the methods and experiences of the craft guilds. Hours of labour were as follows: [...] "All artificers and labourers being hired for wages by the day or week shall, betwixt the midst of the months of March and September, be and continue at their work at or before 5 o'clock in the morning and continue at work and not depart until betwixt 7 and 8 o'clock at night, except it be in the time of breakfast, dinner or drinking, the which time at the most shall not exceed two hours and a half in a day, that is to say, at every drinking half an hour, for his dinner one hour and for his sleep when he is allowed to sleep, the which is from the midst of May to the midst of August, half an hour; and all the said artificers and labourers betwixt the midst of September and the midst of March shall be and continue at their work from the spring of the day in the morning until the night of the same day, except it be in time afore appointed for breakfast and dinner, upon pain to lose and forfeit one penny for every hour's absence, to be deducted and defaulted out of his wages that shall so offend." ...|$|E
