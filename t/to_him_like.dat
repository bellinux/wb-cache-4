5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding {{for someone who has}} not devoted his life <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, {{it is unlikely that the}} impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} hearing {{took place}} on 1 July, {{at the insistence of}} Joseph Marichal, who was threatening to sue Cunard for their poor handling of the disaster. He testified that the second explosion had sounded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> the rattling of machine gun fire and appeared to be below the second class dining room {{at the rear of the}} ship where he had been seated. Information about Marechal's background was sought out by the British government and leaked to the press so as to discredit him.|$|E

25|$|Upon Henry's {{death in}} 936 at Memleben, his son Otto I succeeded him. According to Widukind, he was crowned king at Aachen Cathedral, {{with the other}} German dukes Gilbert of Lorraine, Eberhard of Franconia, Arnulf of Bavaria and Herman of Swabia paying homage <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> his father, {{he chose not to}} {{relinquish}} the Saxon ducal dignity, and instead appointed Hermann Billung a princeps militiae or margrave ("Markgraf") of Saxony in 938, mainly in order to subdue the Slavic Lutici tribes in what was to become the Billung March beyond the Elbe River. He thereby disregarded the claims of Herman's elder brother Wichmann, who in turn joined the failed revolt by Otto's half-brother Thankmar. In 953 and again in 961 King Otto elevated Hermann Billung to a viceduke in Saxony, though he reserved the dux title for himself.|$|E
25|$|From around 1938, his devotees started {{recording}} and attributing various miracles <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> treating incurable diseases, blessing issueless couple with children, bringing back dead {{to life as}} the situation demanded, bilocation, mindreading, materialisation, helping people to see the deity of local shrines like Kheer Bhawani and Hari Parbat in human form {{and also in the}} form of their effulgence and many more, which have been meticulously documented primarily by his principal biographer and also by other devotees. His devotees have also reported miracles after his death. On 3 July 1999, an officer of the 18th Battalion of The Grenadiers regiment of Indian Army reportedly sighted him at the battle front during Kargil war, directing assault operation to recapture Tiger Hills. A similar sighting was reported by an officer of Indian Army during the 1947 war.|$|E
25|$|Both of Montgomery's stepsons became army {{officers}} in the 1930s (both were serving in India {{at the time of}} their mother's death), and both served in the Second World War, each eventually attaining the rank of Colonel. While serving as a GSO2 with Eighth Army, Dick Carver was sent forward during the pursuit after El Alamein to help identify a new site for Eighth Army HQ. He was taken prisoner at Mersa Matruh on 7 November 1942. Montgomery wrote to his contacts in England asking that inquiries be made via the Red Cross as to where his stepson was being held, and that parcels be sent <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>Like</b> many British POWs, the most famous being General Richard O'Connor, Dick Carver escaped in September 1943 during the brief hiatus between Italy's departure from the war and the German seizure of the country. He eventually reached British lines on 5 December 1943, to the delight of his stepfather, who sent him home to Britain to recuperate.|$|E

25|$|The {{acclaimed}} German (later naturalized Swiss) writer Hermann Hesse wrote a {{short story}} in 1915 in which a young man is carried by a giant bird across a mountain range to a distant plain that is <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> another world. Strange News from Another Star tells of the horror experienced by this youth who has volunteered to go to find flowers to bury the dead from an earthquake; flowers that are required during the ceremony of the burial of the dead, in this young man's world, to ease a smooth transition into the next life. In order to speed his journey, he is carried across the mountains by this giant bird, but finds himself in a land where war has left the dead unburied and uncared for, a brutal world, perhaps {{like that of the}} trenches of World War I, a world that he can only believe is from his distant past. Hesse later went on to write the acclaimed novel Siddhartha, exploring the life of Buddha.|$|E
25|$|In 1841 James David Forbes, {{professor}} of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, {{came to see}} the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how {{at a time when the}} idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> paradise. Meanwhile Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must have sounded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a semi-foreign language, heard only at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91–88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E

Sitric {{travelled}} to Northumbria where he assumed the kingship of Northumbria, succeeding his kinsman Ragnall who died the following year. Sitric was followed as King of Dublin by his brother or cousin Gofraid ua Ímair. In 920 Ragnall had submitted to Edward the Elder, King of the Anglo-Saxons. That same year, following his departure from Dublin, Sitric led a raid in Davenport, Cheshire, {{in violation of the}} terms of submission agreed between Ragnall and Edward. Smyth has suggested that this was an act of defiance by Sitric, indicating to Edward that he would not submit <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> Ragnall.|$|E

So it's like in real life…what goes around comes around." [...] The episode {{features}} a guest-starring appearance by Kayla Ewell, who would eventually become most known for her role on The Vampire Diaries. The episode also features a guest appearance by James Jordan, as Lucky, the janitor.

500|$|Among {{the comic}} themes during the Chicago years {{was that of}} {{courtship}} and marriage, with much humor made from the supposed aversion of many Irish males to the altar. The local plumber, Dacey, does not fall to matrimony until he enters the wrong city building and comes out with a marriage license rather than one for a dog. The fireman Hannigan's courting of Dolan's daughter is broken off after fifteen years when he is embarrassed by her giving him a wig as a Christmas present to cover his bald head; but for {{that she would be}} courted still. With Danny Duggan too shy to propose, Father Kelly acts on his behalf, resulting in [...] "the dear little colleen trembling and crying, but holding on <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a pair of ice tongs".|$|E
500|$|Squidward has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans. SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny named Squidward his favorite character on the show.

When {{he tries to}} participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it." [...] Staff writer Casey Alexander said, [...] "Squidward is the character I relate to the most.

500|$|The male parishioner of Manchester, Vermont (in a diocese {{neighboring}} Robinson's) who had alleged the [...] "touching", {{was then}} {{reported to have}} said, during the investigating committee's telephone call with him, that the acts in question were two separate occasions of what felt <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> intentionally seductive arm-squeezing and back-stroking, although in a public setting. The man acknowledged that others might have regarded the two incidents as [...] "natural," [...] yet the incidents were disturbing to him nonetheless. The investigating committee's report also stated that man regretted having used the word [...] "harassment" [...] in his e-mail, and that man declined an invitation to bring formal charges. After a two-day investigation, neither allegation proved of merit. The House of Bishops voted for Robinson in the affirmative, with 62 in favor, 43 opposed, and 2 abstaining.|$|E

The journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 chart-topper [...] "You Are Not Alone", as it sounded <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a track that could have been written by R. Kelly, who penned the number one hit. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis described [...] "Speechless" [...] as a [...] "beautifully minimal, heartfelt romantic ballad". Music journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward [...] "neo-gospel". The New York Post said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "lullaby-like" [...] and the best song on Invincible, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson's [...] "long lines and creamy overdubbed choruses [...] weightlessly" [...] in the ballad, that the journalist felt it was a love song to God.|$|E
500|$|As of 2005, Town Boy {{had been}} reprinted 16times. [...] It {{has also been}} {{translated}} into French and Japanese. [...] Reviews of Town Boy were positive. [...] Librarian George Galuschak liked the book for its detailed crowd scenes and its diverse cast of charactersboth animal and human. [...] The [...] "energy" [...] in Lat's drawings reminded him of Sergio Aragonés and Matt Groening. [...] Laurel Maury, a reviewer for the Los Angeles Times, likened the book to a Peanuts cartoon, but without the melancholy typical of Charles M. Schulz's work. [...] She said that Lat delivered a [...] "rollicking" [...] world and that his characters' interactions made the story unpretentious and heart-warming. [...] Although Spurgeon believed any single scene in Town Boy was superior to any book from a lesser cartoonist, he preferred the narrower scope of The Kampung Boy; he felt the tighter focus of Lat's first book gave a more personal and deeper insight into the author's growth as a young boy. [...] Town Boy, with its quicker pace, felt <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>like</b> a loose collection of heady first-time experiences that failed to explore all possibilities of the encounters.|$|E

[...] Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (...) [...] In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying (...)
