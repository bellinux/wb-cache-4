5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year <b>than</b> <b>students</b> from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects <b>than</b> <b>students</b> in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} <b>than</b> <b>students</b> enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Social {{renewal and}} {{transformation}} remain primary goals for Waldorf schools, which seek to cultivate pupils' {{sense of social}} responsibility. Studies suggest that this is successful; Waldorf pupils {{have been found to}} be more interested in and engaged with social and moral questions and to have more positive attitudes <b>than</b> <b>students</b> from mainstream schools, demonstrating activism and self-confidence and feeling empowered to forge their own futures.|$|E
25|$|Homeschooled {{children}} may receive more individualized attention <b>than</b> <b>students</b> enrolled in traditional public schools. A 2011 {{study suggests that}} a structured environment could {{play a key role}} in homeschooler academic achievement. This means that parents were highly involved in their child’s education and they were creating clear educational goals.

25|$|Compared {{to other}} Czech universities, the student-bed ratio is {{relatively}} low (there are usually more beds <b>than</b> <b>students).</b> Although {{for the first}} couple of weeks of an academic year all beds are taken, within a month or two there are free beds. Therefore, the university can accommodate almost all those who want them, whereas many other Czech universities can provide room only for freshmen. Many students prefer to rent flats, because the rents are about the same as for halls of residence.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, The Programme for International Student Assessment, {{coordinated by}} the OECD, ranks the Italian {{secondary}} education as the 21st in the world, above the United States {{and in the}} OECD average, and observes a wide gap between results in Northern Italian schools, which performed significantly better {{than the national average}} (among {{the best in the world}} in some subjects), and Southern Italian schools, that had much poorer results. Moreover, students in state-owned schools perform better <b>than</b> <b>students</b> in private schools. An Italian student is 19 when they enter university, while in other countries 18 is the more common age.|$|E
25|$|Waldorf schools build close {{learning}} communities, {{founded on}} the shared values of its members, in ways {{that can lead to}} transformative learning experiences that allow all participants, including parents, to become more aware of their own individual path, but which at times also risk becoming exclusive. Reports from small-scale studies suggest that there are lower levels of harassment and bullying in Waldorf schools and that European Waldorf students have extremely lower rates of xenophobia and gender stereotypes <b>than</b> <b>students</b> in any other type of schools. Betty Reardon, a professor and peace researcher, gives Waldorf schools as an example of schools that follow a philosophy based on peace and tolerance.|$|E

50|$|In a 2006 study, LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) found that, {{starting}} in the eighth grade, white students have an initial advantage in reading achievement over black and Hispanic students but not Asian students. Using nationally representative data from by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)—the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) and the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), LoGerfo, Nichols, and Reardon (2006) claim that black students score 5.49 points lower <b>than</b> white <b>students</b> and Hispanic students score 4.83 points lower <b>than</b> white <b>students</b> on reading tests. These differences in initial status are compounded by differences in reading gains made during high school. Specifically, between ninth and tenth grades, white students gain slightly more <b>than</b> black <b>students</b> and Hispanic students, but white <b>students</b> gain less <b>than</b> Asian <b>students.</b> Between tenth and twelfth grades, white students gain at a slightly faster rate <b>than</b> black <b>students,</b> but white students gain at a slower rate <b>than</b> Hispanic <b>students</b> and Asian students.|$|R

25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage <b>than</b> <b>students</b> in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt et al. {{in the use of}} personas. In a partially controlled study, a group of students were asked to solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes <b>than</b> <b>students</b> who did not use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war in}} 1914 led France to recruit Chinese workers for factory work and heavy manual labor. The Chinese Labor Corps in France eventually brought more than 130,000 workers, mostly from North China villages. In June 1915, Li and his Paris friends took this opportunity to provide schooling and training. The Work-Study program was renewed, though on a different basis, bringing less educated workers rather <b>than</b> <b>students.</b> By March 1916 their Paris group, the Société Franco-Chinoise d'Education (華法教育會 Huáfǎ jiàoyùhuì) was directly involved in recruiting and training these workers. The Société had well-placed French backers, mostly on the political left, including Alphonse Aulard, {{the first president of}} the Société, a professor of French history at the Sorbonne; Marius Moutet, vice-president and a socialist member of the National Assembly from Lyon; and Édouard Herriot, mayor of Lyon. They pressed the French government to give the Chinese workers technical education as well as factory work. Li wrote extensive articles in the Chinese Labor Journal (Huagong zazhi), which introduced readers to Western science, arts, fiction, and current events.|$|E
