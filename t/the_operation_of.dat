40|$|Abstract — Queue as a data {{structure}} has important applications to computer science, which includes, {{different types of}} long term and short term operating system scheduling algorithms can be implemented using queue, printers connected to a computer network receive print jobs in a queue. As an abstract data type, <b>the</b> specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> queue are separated from the implementation. Queue is a linear structure, which can be defined and implemented using different linear structures, like list, array etc Using the abstract data type, list to implement a queue implies using <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract data type, list to design the algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract data type, queue. This paper uses the ADT, list to present two variants of the abstract data type, queue. For each type of queue, it uses the algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> list to design the algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstract data type, queue. It also designs the algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> queue of pairs by using the algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> list of pairs...|$|R
