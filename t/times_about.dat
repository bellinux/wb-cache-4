5|$|In 2005, after {{a series}} of {{articles}} in the Los Angeles <b>Times</b> <b>about</b> the spending practices of the Getty Trust and its then-president Dr. Barry Munitz, the California Attorney General conducted an investigation of the Getty Trust and found that no laws had been broken. The trust agreed to appoint an outside monitor to review future expenditures. The Getty Trust experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1,487 budgeted staff positions to reduce expenses. Although the Getty Trust endowment reached $6.4 billion in 2007, it dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. The endowment rebounded to $6.2 billion by 2013.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four <b>times</b> <b>about</b> its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York <b>Times</b> <b>about</b> it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

He suspects a psychic projection of these beings has remained on the alien ship and is being seen by those who come into contact with it.|$|E

5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous {{ideas about the}} exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern <b>times</b> <b>about</b> the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
5|$|By mid 1954 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} two novels—Casino Royale (1953) and Live and Let Die (1954)—and had a third, Moonraker, being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That year he read a story in The Sunday <b>Times</b> <b>about</b> diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, then working in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company De Beers. The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers, a non-fiction book published in 1957.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three <b>times</b> <b>about</b> the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach to infinity. The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.|$|E

5|$|It {{was assumed}} {{at first that}} the lake existed in a single long {{interval}} between 1000-1500; however, later a succession of wet and dry phases was determined from radiocarbon dating. Each phase was stable for prolonged <b>times.</b> <b>About</b> three or four highstands were identified in the lake, one theory assumes four highstands between 695-1580. One chronology assumes these highstands occurred 100 BC - 600 AD, 900-1250 and 1300-1500. Six or five different cycles are documented in Coachella. At Superstition Mountain five lake cycles from 817-964, 1290-1330, 1440-1640, 1480-1660, 1638-1689 and 1675-1687 are documented; the 1440-1640 cycle may have consisted of four sub-cycles that occurred within short time distances from each other. An older highstand was observed at East Mesa and dated to 3,850 years before present. At least 12 different cycles of lake growth and lake shrinkage occurred over the last 2,000 - 3,000 years. Radiocarbon dates of the highstands range 300 ± 100 to 1,580 ± 200 before present. The basin was probably not entirely dry between the last three highstands. The Colorado River Delta shows evidence of reduced sedimentation while the river drained into Lake Cahuilla.|$|E
