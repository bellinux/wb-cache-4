5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E

5|$|A {{phosphatase}} is {{an enzyme}} <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> water to cleave a phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol.

5|$|M-64 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> the highway. These traffic counts are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This number {{is an expression of}} the traffic <b>that</b> <b>uses</b> a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT's surveys showed that the highest AADT along M-64 was 3,333vehicles daily on the Ontonagon River Bridge; the lowest traffic was between US2 and the Gogebic–Ontonagon county line at 418vehicles per day. The only segments of the trunkline that have been included on the National Highway System (NHS) are the US2 and M-28 concurrencies. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E
