5|$|Another {{group of}} rides in Olde Idlewild is located around the park's Skooters, added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is the Balloon Race, Paratrooper, Ferris wheel, and Spider. Below the Paratrooper {{on the north}} bank of the Loyalhanna are <b>the</b> <b>Whip,</b> built in 1938, and the Super Round Up. <b>The</b> <b>Whip</b> is closed indefinitely for repair.|$|E
5|$|Along the Humboldt, {{the group}} met Paiute Native Americans, who joined {{them for a}} couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner {{families}} split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.|$|E
5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>whipping</b> boy can be from {{virtually}} any background. Occasionally <b>the</b> <b>whipping</b> boy was from high born, but {{could have been}} an orphan or foundling. In order to have <b>the</b> <b>whipping</b> boy be an effective tool for disciplining the prince, the prince must feel empathy for <b>the</b> <b>whipping</b> boy so they must form an emotional bond. This connection between the two boys rests in the idea that a prince seeing a friend being whipped or beaten for something that he had done wrong would increase the likelihood that the prince would not make the same mistake again.|$|R
50|$|Whips have {{historically}} been brutal to backbenchers to secure their vote. <b>The</b> <b>whip's</b> offices to this day display <b>the</b> <b>whips</b> that were once used to 'encourage' MPs to vote according to their party line.|$|R
5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense and aggression, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the book}} <b>The</b> Chain <b>Whip,</b> this may refer to <b>the</b> hard <b>whip</b> (more akin to a {{truncheon}} than a multi-section <b>whip)</b> due to <b>the</b> ambiguity in the Chinese. [...] "Both <b>the</b> hard <b>whip</b> and <b>the</b> soft <b>whip</b> can both be referred to simply as whip (鞭) in Chinese.". Different books make wildly differing claims {{about the history of}} <b>the</b> Chain <b>Whip.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Government Chief <b>Whip</b> is {{assisted}} by <b>the</b> Deputy Chief <b>Whip,</b> other Whips, and Assistant Whips. In {{order to give}} them a salary for what is in essence a party office, <b>the</b> government <b>whips</b> are appointed to positions in HM Treasury and in the Royal Household under the Lord Steward of <b>the</b> Household. <b>The</b> <b>whips</b> are not fully active in either of these departments, though do undertake a number of responsibilities. <b>The</b> Deputy Chief <b>Whip</b> is Treasurer of HM Household, <b>the</b> next two <b>Whips</b> are Comptroller of HM Household and Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household, and <b>the</b> remaining <b>Whips</b> are Lords Commissioners of <b>the</b> Treasury. Assistant <b>Whips,</b> and Whips of opposition parties, generally do not receive such appointments.|$|R
5|$|Young led his {{league in}} wins five times (1892, 1895, and 19011903), {{finishing}} second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two {{more than the}} runners-up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, {{but this was not}} uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although <b>the</b> <b>WHIP</b> ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.|$|E
25|$|Two to {{four months}} after the fungus has {{infected}} the plant, black whip-like structures, instead of a spindle leaf, emerge from the meristem, or growing point, of the plant. The developing whip is a mixture of plant tissue and fungal tissue. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> reaches maturity between the sixth and the seventh month. When spores that are contained inside <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> are released, the core of <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> remains behind and is a straw-like color.|$|E
25|$|The longe whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse.|$|E

25|$|On 13 November 2010 one famous riding whip {{appeared}} in a country house auction in Slane Castle held by Adams. This whip was owned by Her Imperial Majesty and was given to Robert Fowler who was the Master of the Meath Hounds {{at the time of}} her stay in Summerhill. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> had been lost and had been found not long before the auction in Rahinston House. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> was found in a mahogany presentation case with a silver crest plate bearing the Imperial Arms of Habsburg. <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> was estimated at €3,000-€5,000 but reached a total of €37,000 (£33,945).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Chief <b>Whip</b> is a {{political}} office in some legislatures whose task is to administer <b>the</b> <b>whipping</b> system that tries to ensure {{that members of the}} party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. In British politics, <b>the</b> Chief <b>Whip</b> of <b>the</b> governing party in the House of Commons is usually also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. <b>The</b> Government Chief <b>Whip</b> has an official residence at 12 Downing Street. However, <b>the</b> Chief <b>Whip's</b> office is currently located at 9 Downing Street.|$|R
25|$|Pointing <b>the</b> <b>whip</b> at the {{shoulder}} is {{used to make the}} horse move out or stops him from moving inward on the circle.|$|E

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, <b>the</b> <b>whip.</b> Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. Dessalines' chief motivator nonetheless was production and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using <b>the</b> <b>whip,</b> many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working. Dessalines effectively sent the Haitian people back into slavery. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the countryside and in raising production levels.|$|E

50|$|Some of <b>the</b> {{government}} <b>whips</b> {{are also}} associated in name with the Treasury: <b>the</b> Chief <b>Whip</b> is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had {{an office in}} 12 Downing Street. Some of <b>the</b> other <b>whips</b> are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are {{all members of the}} House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow <b>the</b> <b>whips</b> to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since <b>the</b> <b>whips</b> no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>whip</b> {{usually has}} a stock of 6 feet (1.8 m), with a lash of 56 feet (1.51.8 m) (although some are longer). <b>The</b> <b>whip</b> is light, easy to handle, and well balanced. It is not {{safe to use}} a riding or driving whip for longeing because they are too short to reach the horse without {{bringing}} the handler {{close enough to the}} horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The longe whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment.|$|E

40|$|Vegetable whipped creams are {{nowadays}} {{a popular}} alternative to <b>the</b> traditional dairy <b>whipped</b> creams. <b>The</b> emulsions {{standing at the}} base of vegetable whipped creams are classified as O/W emulsions. During whipping air is incorporated and entrapped by a fat crystallize network. This is achieved by the fat droplets interaction through the partial coalescence mechanism. Hence the presence of a crystalline fat phase is imperative within the formulation of <b>the</b> <b>whipped</b> cream. In order to control the partial coalescence and stabilize both the emulsion and <b>the</b> <b>whipped</b> cream, emulsifiers are required. Therefore in such systems, proteins and LMW surfactants coexists and dictate the degree and rate of partial coalesce. This allows the tailoring of the sensorial attributes and physico-chemical properties of <b>the</b> <b>whipped</b> cream (e. g. stability, overrun, texture). Nevertheless the impact of the components on <b>the</b> <b>whipped</b> cream properties has to be understood as a whole and not as individual effects of fats, proteins and LMW surfactants...|$|R
