The growing volume of network data generated and captured makes it increasingly difficult to detect increasingly sophisticated reconnaissance and stealthy network attacks. We propose a network flow filtering mechanism that leverages the exposure maps technique of Whyte et al.

This allows focus to be limited to selected subsets of the network traffic, for example what might be categorized (correctly or otherwise) as the unexpected or potentially malicious portion. In particular, we use this technique to filter out traffic from sources that have not gained knowledge from the network in question. We evaluate the benefits of our technique on different visualizations of network flows. Our analysis shows a significant decrease in the volume of network traffic that is to be visualized, resulting in visible patterns and insights not previously apparent. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, many hubs in {{the highly}} interdependent U. S. air {{transport}} network have become congested, leading to delays for business travelers and freight shipments. Recent events in this industry may have temporarily reduced this congestion, but contributed to other types of disruptions. Since delays and disruptions at one node of the network exacerbate problems throughout the system, airport infrastructure expansion to enhance <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> and <b>security</b> in large hubs may confer substantive spillover benefits {{in the form of}} travel-time savings and reliability. This may in turn translate into increased worker productivity and shipping efficiency, and thus lower costs, for manufacturing firms. In this paper we evaluate the impacts of such spillovers, by applying spatial econometrics techniques to a cost function framework, using state-level data on airport and highway infrastructure, and manufacturing production. We find that increasing own-state airport infrastructure tends to generate cost-saving benefits for the state's manufacturing industry, primarily due to non-production labor- and materials-savings. However, airport expansion in connected hubs has an even greater impact, implying an important externality component of such investment. Also, unless airport expansion is accompanied by highway infrastructure investment, congestion seems to counteract the associated benefits, especially in large-hub states with less than 5 percent of the nation's passenger enplanements...|$|R

This paper intends to tackle the impractical time-invariant assumptions which underlie the methods currently used to develop short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors: i) the characteristics of current data captured by on-road sensors are assumed to be time-invariant with respect to those of the historical data, which is used to developed short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors; and ii) the configuration of the on-road sensor systems is assumed to be time-invariant. In fact, both assumptions are impractical in the real world, as the current <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics can be very different from the historical ones, and also the on-road sensor systems are time-varying in nature due to damaged sensors or component wear. Therefore, misleading forecasting results are likely to be produced when short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors are designed using these two time-invariant assumptions. To tackle these time-invariant assumptions, an intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm, namely IPSO, is proposed to develop short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> predictors by integrating the mechanisms of particle swarm optimization, neural network and fuzzy inference system, in order to adapt to the time-varying <b>traffic</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics and the time-varying configurations of the on-road sensor systems.
