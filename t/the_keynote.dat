40|$|I think, {{therefore}} I am. ” Descartes’ indubitable proposition {{has become}} a cliché partly because it sounded one of <b>the</b> <b>keynotes</b> of modern philosophy down to the present day.

Therefore, as the epistemological, metaphysical and ethical implications of Descartes’ “subjective turn” are explored in different ways by modern thinkers, there are moments {{in which they can}} return to Cynic themes also: notably individualism, hostility to authority, scepticism, naturalism and indifference to metaphysical transcendence.
