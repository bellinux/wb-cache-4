5|$|Samira Rajab, the country's Minister of State for Information (and Rajab's cousin twice over) {{declared}} that Rajab had enjoyed {{a fair trial}} with unrestricted access to legal assistance.

5|$|Writing for The Escapist, Allen Varney {{felt that}} the {{political}} awareness was overstated because the percentage of The Movies films <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> social commentary remained small and because the machinima and political communities were mostly separate. He argued that machinima's outstanding copyright issues and possible marginalization constrained potential for expression. Marino and others added concerns that, although game developers had condoned machinima, a controversial film could prompt them to control machinima content by enforcing their copyrights.|$|E

5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis {{served as}} a {{gathering}} place for organizing troops. As Indianapolis's citizens rallied {{in support of the}} Union, its population increased with the arrival of new businesses and industries <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> additional employment opportunities and spurred real estate development. City residents experienced rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. It was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans.

In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> a shadow of relief.|$|E

5|$|Gyeongju is {{strongly}} associated with the education tradition of Hwarangdo ("Way of the Flower of Young Men") which was established and flourished during the Silla period. It is a military and philosophical code <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> the basis of training to Hwarang, a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla's greatest generals and military leaders such as Kim Yu-sin were Hwarang who {{played a central role}} in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, Goryeo, the system declined and was officially disbanded in the Joseon dynasty. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name.|$|E

Catherine {{came from a}} wealthy Protestant family and brought with her a dowry of £2,000, but also a religious association <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> Robert some respite from the recusancy laws then in effect. From {{the death of his}} grandmother the following year he inherited a property at Chastleton, in Oxfordshire. The couple's first son William died in infancy, but their second son Robert survived, and was baptised at Chastleton's Protestant church on 11November 1595. When Catesby's father died in 1598, his estates at Ashby St Ledgers were left to his wife, while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton. Catesby had seemed happy to remain a Church Papist but after his wife's death later that year he became radicalised, and reverted to a more fanatical Catholicism.|$|E

Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would be a boon to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus Löb {{writes that}} {{proposals}} and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans {{along in the}} hope of slowing the deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, <b>that</b> <b>offered</b> $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest.|$|E

She was 23 years old and pregnant when she began her doctoral studies, and the Rubins had one young child at home. She began to take classes with Francis Heyden, who recommended her to George Gamow, her eventual doctoral advisor. Her dissertation, completed in 1954, concluded that galaxies clumped together, rather than being randomly distributed through the universe, a controversial idea not pursued by others for two decades. Throughout her graduate studies, she experienced discouraging sexism, including an incident where she {{was not allowed to}} meet with her advisor in his office, because women were not allowed in that area of the university.|$|E
