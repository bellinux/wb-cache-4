40|$|Ca {{currents}} {{have been}} measured from frog atrial myocardium {{by use of}} a double sucrose gap voltage clamp technique. Ca inward currents could be separated from overlapping outward currents by means of application of 10 mM 4 -aminopyridine and an intracellular Cs-load. The inactivation process of the Ca currents could be separated into two parts: a fast Ca-dependent inactivation and a slow voltage-dependent inactivation. The time constant of the fast decay of the Ca currents was decreased due to increased external Ca concentrations and was U-shaped depending on the membrane potential. As indicated by twin pulse experiments inactivation of a test current following a conditioning current could be increased by increasing the charge inwardly transported during the conditioning current. Long-lasting prepulses being too weak to activate any inward current could also inactivate the <b>test</b> <b>current.</b> <b>Recorded</b> by a prepulse protocol steady-state inactivation curves were described by a half maximum inactivation at - 36. 7 mV and a slope of 4. 2 mV. All the results refer on a joint voltage and calcium dependent inactivation controlling the inwardly transported Ca via the Ca channels. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A new voltage-clamp {{apparatus}} for {{the squid}} axon has been implemented to enable <b>recording</b> of <b>currents</b> through small areas of axon membrane.

The I patch records, although four orders of magnitude smaller than 1 tot, were stable and showed normal kinetics and voltage dependence, and appeared to reflect the activation of a small population of normal sodium channels.

40|$|Abstract—Current {{trends in}} the agile {{software}} development prefer to deliver finished stories with automated tests, which results in a fact that many Quality assurance engineers struggle {{with the lack of}} time. Rapidly changing applications prevent them from finishing the automation {{by the end of the}} sprint as they cannot develop the tests in advance, and have to wait until the stable deliverable is done. Test recording might help them to resolve the problem as it offers very fast test automation in comparison to other approaches. However, it results in a very expensive and a time demanding test maintenance. In this paper, we present an approach that helps the engineers with the maintenance by introducing a concept of automatically detected reusable parts within the test recordings. Those reusable parts increase the efficiency of the <b>test</b> <b>recording</b> approach, remove its main drawbacks, and help to bring <b>test</b> <b>recording</b> closer to scripting approaches.
