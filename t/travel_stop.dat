50|$|By {{the end of}} 1981, {{the company}} reached a {{milestone}} with 100 Love's Country Stores locations in operation. The in-store decor was changed from the previous dark country look to a brighter theme. The same year, it opened the first Love's <b>Travel</b> <b>Stop</b> on Interstate 40 in Amarillo, Texas. The <b>travel</b> <b>stop</b> opened a new target audience to Love's business; the addition of self-serve diesel fuel brought professional drivers to Love's. The <b>Travel</b> <b>Stop</b> was unique in that it served both the professional driver and the motoring public, resulting in more growth for Love's.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{most unusual}} move, Robert Irsay (1923-1997), then owner of Los Angeles Rams, and then-current Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom (1907-1979) swapped franchises in 1972. Under the new Irsay regime, the Colts' new general manager Joe Thomas (1921-1983) made some daring and {{ultimately}} rewarding trades and drafts which again brought the Colts to prominence in the NFL. However, by the late '70s/early '80s, key injuries (especially to their franchise QB, Bert Jones, who ironically wound up going to the Rams) and ill-advised personnel moves by Irsay caused the team's fortunes to sag, and attendance in the modest stadium did as well. Further, neither Irsay nor the city could agree to desperately-needed improvements to the aging and tattered stadium, so Irsay started visiting other cities, seeking to either motivate the city or woo another. Finally, a quick <b>travel</b> <b>stop</b> with a B.W.I. Airport conference was held with City Mayor William Donald Schaefer (1921-2011), which also proved fruitless. Irsay then negotiated with Indiana officials and in Indianapolis with Mayor William H. Hudnut, III, and they stunned the sports world by transferring to Indianapolis, with Mayflower Moving Company moving vans trucking the club's equipment to Indiana {{in the middle of}} a snowy night on March 29, 1984, under the threat of a measure introduced into the state legislature to initiate condemnation proceedings for the city and state to assert [...] "eminent domain" [...] and take ownership of the franchise on behalf of the citizens and fans. This event dramatically shifted the political establishment's view on how best to address the later continued stadium upgrade needs of the Orioles, the only remaining tenant.|$|E
40|$|Drop {{testing of}} micro-machined accelerometers from {{the height of}} a table top to a solid surface shows that a {{moderate}} impact can result in severe damage of transducer elements. The relative high stiffness of the accelerometer device in combination with a high contact stiffness of the solid surface cause extremely high acceleration pulses at the impact. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the consequences of dropping a micro-machined transducer structure to a solid surface. The analysis is composed of experimental testing and numerical simulation. Impact forces are measured for bare sensor chips and molded sensor devices by means of an instrumented drop test. Structural simulation models are generated for micro-machined transducers. These models consider the dynamics of the deformation behavior of moveable elements including a <b>travel</b> <b>stop</b> and associated possible impact inside the sensor element. Maximum stresses are calculated in critical regions of the transducer. Weibull theory and statistical distributions of material strength are considered in order to predict the probability for crack initiation due to stress concentrations...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{modification}} project {{for one of the}} fields in the North Sea, the optimal failure position of three new globe valves has been studied. In a gas compression train, the gas needs to be cooled to a set temperature, and the globe valves control the amount of cooling medium required through the heat exchangers to reach this set temperature. A wrong choice of failure position could potentially cause expensive and important process equipment to get damaged. The four failure positions that have been studied are fail open, fail close, fail close with <b>travel</b> <b>stop</b> and fail in position. Results were obtained using the simulation tools HYSYS and PIPENET, and calculations in Excel. Fail close is not an optimal failure position, but it has been considered the most optimal as of today. It is very likely that this failure position will lead to a process shut down, which will give reduced production. The reason why it is still considered the most optimal solution is that no equipment will get damaged, and the actuator solution is well proven and trustable. The results show that fail in position is the failure position which is best from a process point of view. There are however several questions connected to the actuator solution of fail in position. It is a relatively new failure position solution, which is why AKSO {{have not been able to}} get any feedback on how it works. It is very likely that fail in position will be used in similar installations in the future, when the actuator solution has been verified and improved if necessary. It has been found that fail open is the least optimal failure solution. As the heat exchanger cooling medium demand will increase significantly when the valves are left fully open, there will be deficit of cooling medium to the other cooling medium consumers. A possible consequence of this is a process shutdown to avoid overheating of important process equipment. Another possible consequence of fail open as the failure position is hydrate formation, which in worst case can lead to damages to the compressors...|$|E
