5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father.

5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign.

In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him.

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. <b>The</b> <b>father's</b> semen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mother's menses have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics.

40|$|An unusual case {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection in a child was studied. The child, identified as HIV- 1 infected at 5 years of age, lived with his parents and a 3 -year-old sister. HIV- 1 infection was excluded in the mother and sister, but confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> who was unaware of his infection and was in good health, apart from an atopic dermatitis on the face and limbs. A portion of the HIV- 1 proviral envelope gene was amplified from <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> child's peripheral blood cells, and the amplified products were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis disclosed that <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> child's viral sequences clustered together, and were clearly distinct from the sequence sets obtained from six epidemiologically unlinked mother-child HIV- 1 -infected pairs included in the analysis. HIV- 1 variability was lower in the child's sequence set than in <b>the</b> <b>father's,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> variability between <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> child's sequences was significantly lower than that found between epidemiologically unlinked cases (p < 0. 001), An uncommon APGR moth {{on the tip of}} the V 3 domain was found in both <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> child's viral clones. These data, together with the epidemiological investigations, strongly suggest that the child acquired the infection from his father, possibly by exposure to bleeding skin lesion...|$|R

5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration of the shot does not correspond with the time necessary for <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E

Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the name of <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> <b>and</b> the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|Daddy's Double is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Film Corporation. The film focuses on Hal, a young man, who proposes to Sue, his love interest. Her father overhears and becomes furious before whisking his daughter away to a boarding school. Hal and Sue attempt to elope, but it is foiled. Hal then gets an idea to disguise himself as <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> reclaim Sue. The plan works, but the father follows in pursuit. He breaks into the wedding ceremony at the parson's house and sees his double. He then laughs and approves of the marriage. The film was the fourth release by Thanhouser and it was met with favorable reviews by critics. In 2007, a surviving print was released on DVD with a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacher.|$|E

5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E

He also reopened the question of the Vexin which had formed part of Margaret's dowry several years before; Henry still occupied the region and now Philip insisted that the King either complete the long agreed Richard-Alice marriage, or return Margaret's dowry. Philip invaded the Berry and Henry mobilised a large army which confronted the French at Châteauroux, before papal intervention brought a truce. During the negotiations, however, Philip suggested to Richard that he should ally with the French king against Henry, marking {{the start of a new}} strategy to divide <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> son.|$|E
