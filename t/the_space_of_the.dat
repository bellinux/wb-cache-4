This followed discussion at four War Cabinet meetings (including the 31 October meeting) over <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous two months. In order to aid the discussions, the War Cabinet Secretariat, led by Maurice Hankey and supported by his Assistant Secretaries – primarily Sykes and his fellow Conservative MP and pro-Zionist Leo Amery – solicited outside perspectives to put before the Cabinet. These included the views of government ministers, war allies – notably from President Woodrow Wilson – and in October, formal submissions from six Zionist leaders and four non-Zionist Jews.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal beat Newcastle United 3–1 to move {{within four}} points of Manchester United in early April. The return of Bergkamp from a three-match {{suspension}} helped Arsenal to trounce Blackburn Rovers; the team scored three goals in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening 14 minutes. Manchester United's failure to beat Newcastle United meant Arsenal went {{top of the}} league table after beating Wimbledon by five goals to nil. Victory against Barnsley and four days later at home against Derby County meant Arsenal needed one more win become league champions, regardless of Manchester United's results. Although Bergkamp was ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season having sustained an injury against Derby, Arsenal eased to a 4–0 win against Everton – the last goal scored by club captain Tony Adams to become the first club other than Manchester United or Blackburn Rovers to win the Premier League. A run of ten straight victories – a new record, was set, and Wenger became the first non-British manager to lead a team to win the league championship. Arsenal lost their final two matches of the league season, choosing to rest players for the upcoming FA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve to define <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus while dividing {{the import of}} the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts {{with the edge of}} the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E

25|$|The eigendecomposition of a {{symmetric}} positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix yields an orthogonal {{basis of}} eigenvectors, {{each of which}} has a nonnegative eigenvalue. The orthogonal decomposition of a PSD matrix is used in multivariate analysis, where the sample covariance matrices are PSD. This orthogonal decomposition is called principal components analysis (PCA) in statistics. PCA studies linear relations among variables. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix (in which each variable is scaled to have its sample variance equal to one). For the covariance or correlation matrix, the eigenvectors correspond to principal components and the eigenvalues to the variance explained by the principal components. Principal component analysis of the correlation matrix provides an orthonormal eigen-basis for <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed data: In this basis, the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components that are associated with most of the covariability among a number of observed data.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has two mechanical floors between the 8th and 9th floor and two mechanical floors between 51 and the roof level. They {{are known as}} 8A, 8B and 51A, 51B. They are not accessible {{from any of the}} building's passenger elevators and contain HVAC equipment. As a result, the 9thfloor is really the 11thfloor and the 51stfloor is really 53rd. This can be elucidated from the outside of the building or by walking down the stairwell from the 9thfloor or higher. There is also a floor 2A which is inaccessible except from the freight elevators. There are also three floors beneath the IDS called P1, P2, and P3. These are storage levels for tenants and also are connected to the parking ramp below the IDS. Neither 2A, or P's 1, 2, and 3 are counted as actual floors.
