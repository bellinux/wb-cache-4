2500|$|While {{awaiting}} sentencing, Madoff {{met with}} the SEC's Inspector General, H.

Madoff said {{he could have been}} caught in 2003, but that bumbling investigators had acted like [...] "Lt. Colombo" [...] and never asked the right questions: I was astonished. They never even looked at my stock records. If investigators had checked with The Depository Trust Company, a central securities depository, it would've been easy for them to see. If you're looking at a Ponzi scheme, it's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Madoff said in the June 17, 2009, interview that SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro was a [...] "dear friend", and SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter was a [...] "terrific lady" [...] whom he knew [...] "pretty well".|$|E

[...] Cui Yan replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and the Nine Provinces are divided, while the Yuan brothers fight among themselves and the bodies of the dead are scattered throughout the wilderness.

Is this what the people in this province expect of you?" [...] Those present at the scene were all startled by Cui Yan's response. Cao Cao's facial expression changed and he thanked Cui Yan for his advice.|$|E

2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E

"You {{plunge into}} the woods for change, for solitude," [...] the girl said, [...] "and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is to find me waylaying you {{in the depths of}} the forest.

6000|$|... "But not alone," [...] said I. And {{together}} {{we walked through}} the woods, over the little field and across the Havelot lawn to the house. We {{were told that the}} old gentleman was in his library, and {{together we}} entered the room. Mr. Havelot was sitting by a table on which were lying several open volumes of an encyclopedia. When he turned and saw us, he closed his book, pushed back his chair and took off his spectacles. [...] "Upon my word, sir," [...] he cried; [...] "and so <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> after they pull you out of the earth is to come here and break my commands." ...|$|E

6000|$|Judge Douglas {{also makes}} the {{declaration}} that I say the Democrats are bound by the Dred Scott decision, while the Republicans are not. In {{the sense in which}} he argues, I never said it; but I will tell you what I have said and what I do not hesitate to repeat to-day. I have said that as the Democrats believe that decision to be correct, and that the extension of slavery is affirmed in the National Constitution, they are bound to support it as such; and I will tell you here that General Jackson once said each man was bound to support the Constitution [...] "as he understood it." [...] Now, Judge Douglas understands the Constitution according to the Dred Scott decision, and he is bound to support it as he understands it. I understand it another way, and therefore I am bound to support it {{in the way in which}} I understand it. And as Judge Douglas believes that decision to be correct, I will remake that argument if I have time to do so. Let me talk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face. We will say you are a member of the Territorial Legislature, and, like Judge Douglas, you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a constitutional right <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is to swear you will support the Constitution, and all rights guaranteed therein; that you will, whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his constitutional rights, not withhold that legislation. If you withhold that necessary legislation for the support of the Constitution and constitutional rights, do you not commit perjury? I ask every sensible man if that is not so? That is undoubtedly just so, say what you please. Now, that is precisely what Judge Douglas says, that this is a constitutional right. Does the Judge mean to say that the Territorial Legislature in legislating may, by withholding necessary laws, or by passing unfriendly laws, nullify that constitutional right? Does he mean to say that? Does he mean to ignore the proposition so long and well established in law, that what you cannot do directly, you cannot do indirectly? Does he mean that? The truth about the matter is this: Judge Douglas has sung paeans to his [...] "Popular Sovereignty" [...] doctrine until his Supreme Court, co-operating with him, has squatted his Squatter Sovereignty out. But he will keep up this species of humbuggery about Squatter Sovereignty. He has at last invented this sort of do-nothing sovereignty,--that the people may exclude slavery by a sort of [...] "sovereignty" [...] that is exercised by doing nothing at all. Is not that running his Popular Sovereignty down awfully? Has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death? But at last, when it is brought to the test of close reasoning, there is not even that thin decoction of it left. It is a presumption impossible in the domain of thought. It is precisely no other than the putting of that most unphilosophical proposition, that two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time. The Dred Scott decision covers the whole ground, and while it occupies it, there is no room even for the shadow of a starved pigeon to occupy the same ground.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the intense}} media {{coverage}} that the Internet has attracted {{over the past}} few years, one might reasonably argue that the Internet needs no introduction. It has successfully permeated into our everyday lives in a myriad of ways. Every parent must now feel the obligation to ensure that their child has access to the Internet as part of their overall education. Similarly, no advertising campaign is now complete without reference to a Web site {{and if you want to}} know something about an unknown organisation (whether company, University or law firm), <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is look up their Web site. Over the past few years, most Internet users have ceased worrying about what the Internet is and how it works and have begun to treat it more like the telephone – a convenient appliance for certain tasks. But at the same time, the Internet is becoming an increasingly complex place. There are an ever-increasing number of different terms that are being used in Internet circles – not only do we have e-mail, we now have e-anything e. g. e-commerce, e-business, e-journals, esolutions and not just the Internet but intranets and extranets as well. Meanwhile the digirati are dreaming up ever more obscure terms of art – channels, clickstream and enterprise information portals to name but a few of the current buzzwords. This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is designed to explain a little of how the Internet works, both in terms of the technology and the administration. In the second part, the main legal issues relating to the Internet are addressed. This second part of this chapter is intended to set the stage for the remainder of this book...|$|E
40|$|What's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{when you}} wake up in the morning, before you even brush your teeth? Most of us reach for our {{smartphone}} that spent the night recharging by our side while we tried to do the same. In a leap that would have seemed astonishing just over a decade ago, many of us are now constantly connected to our digital world through our mobile device; we see this play out across many facets of daily life. There are those of us whose first instinct at the start of the day is to grab that little device and see what occurred during our non-waking hours. Perhaps we check the email that's flooded into our inbox overnight. Next we check Facebook, Twitter, or a favorite news app to catch up on the latest global occurrence. It seems that for many, this desire to check is increasingly irresistible. Regulatory Focus Theory (Higgins, 1997) and Regulatory Mode Theory (Kruglanski et al, 2000) suggest that the reasons behind this drive to check and stay connected may differ based upon our motivational tendencies. Our motivational orientation [...] promotion or prevention, assessment or locomotion impacts our lives in countless ways. We know that the effects of motivational orientation play out across career paths, management styles, parenting, negotiations, animal behavior, health and wellness, romantic relationships and the list goes on. Regulatory focus and mode have not yet, however, been applied to our relatively new obsession with mobile technology, which is a space that is rapidly evolving and shaping much of our physical, social, and emotional world. This research aims to understand two key questions: 1. What motivates the constant checking behavior that has become an inherent part of our daily life? 2. How does our subjective experience with such behavior impact our general well-being? Using a within subjects, longitudinal design of 740 demographically representative Americans, we extracted two separate, yet complimentary stories that encompass objective smartphone checking behavior (captured through native application passive meter technology) and the subjective smartphone experience (assessed via 18 self-report questions surrounding smartphone engagement). Our results suggest that it is in fact our motivational approach to life that fuels our need to stay connected. However, it means something different depending upon what motivations are involved. In addition, the data reveals that our subjective experience surrounding smartphone engagement impacts our general levels of well being...|$|E
