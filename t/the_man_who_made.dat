25|$|Terrero was {{lieutenant}} general {{before he became}} Governor General of the Philippines on April 4, 1885 due to his appointment to the post by Praxedes Mateo Sagasta, then Prime Minister of Spain. Terrero {{started out as a}} new Carlist, but after seeing first hand the abuses and avarice of the friars and their blatant disregard of the laws of the land, he gradually abandoned his absolutist and apostolic Carlist convictions and was transformed into a liberal, reform-minded and anti-clerical Governor General. He took part in the Carolinas dispute between Spain and Germany in 1885, in which the friars funded construction of a ship named Crucera Filipina in 1886. The dispute raised alarm in Manila that a German invasion of the Philippines was imminent, with the Carolinas taken by Germany without resistance. Terrero himself awarded the two leaders he sent to facilitate Carolinas who escaped. The erection of a monument in honor of King Carlos IV, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> smallpox vaccine possible in the Philippines, was initiated in 1824, and finally accomplished during Terrero's term. In the middle of 1887, few electric lights were established along the quays from the mouth of Pasig River to the first bridge, and one light also on that bridge, so that steamers could enter the river after sunset if desired. A concession {{for the construction of a}} railway line from Manila to Dagupan was granted to Don Edmundo Sykes of the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan on June 1, 1887. The Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan which constitutes much of the North Main Line today, began construction in July 1887 with the laying of the cornerstone for Tutuban station by Terrero himself.|$|E

500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E
500|$|The West Indies toured Australia in 1992–93, {{recovering}} from losing the second Test {{to win the}} final two matches and take the series 2–1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in Wisden, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, [...] "paid tribute to <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world's leading bowler". On {{the first day of}} the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as [...] "one of Test cricket's most devastating spells". West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose's performance as [...] "instrumental in winning [...] " [...] and his bowling as [...] "flawless".|$|E

[...] Newspaper reports indicated that the Warren Commission was made aware of Bolden's allegations and quoted an unnamed member of the Commission as stating: [...] "It would appear that he is trying to get off the hook by making such charges now. Nevertheless, the charges he makes are serious. He desires to testify and his request ought to be approved." [...] According to the Associated Press, a spokesman for the Commission stated that they were considering calling Bolden, but had made no decision.|$|E

2500|$|Goldman depicts Paul McCartney in an {{extremely}} positive light, as being the only true talent among the Beatles, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> the band able to function. [...] On January 16, 1980, customs officials in Japan found 7.7 ounces (218.3 g) of cannabis in McCartney's luggage as {{he and the other}} musicians in Wings tried to enter the country for a concert tour. Rather than lay the blame for this incident on McCartney, Albert Goldman asserts that it was orchestrated by Yoko Ono. She supposedly had advance notice that her husband's friend would be smuggling drugs into her homeland. [...] She allegedly made overseas telephone calls to government officials she knew with the hope that he would be arrested, thereby giving her a good excuse to forbid her husband from communicating with his friend.|$|E

Yet now, having played 540 minutes, this scoring machine has piled up 621 points, and even if Michigan is shut out by Minnesota in seventy minutes of play the Wolverines will have obtained an average that is the greatest feat in gridiron history." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bowdlers {{were not}} the first to {{undertake}} such a project, but, despite being considered a negative example by some, their editions made it more acceptable to teach Shakespeare to wider and younger audiences. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne said, [...] "More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler. No man ever did better service to Shakespeare than <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children". Bowdler's commitment not to augment Shakespeare's text was in contrast with the practice of some earlier editors and performers. [...] Nahum Tate as Poet Laureate had rewritten the tragedy of King Lear with a happy ending. [...] In 1807 Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb published Tales from Shakespeare for children with synopses of 20 of the plays, seldom quoting the original text.|$|E
