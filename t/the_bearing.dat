5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|In sailing, it {{has long}} been known that if <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> from the target to the pursuer remains {{constant}}, known as constant bearing, decreasing range (CBDR), equivalent to taking a fixed reference point at infinite distance, the two vessels are on a collision course, both travelling in straight lines. In a simulation, this is readily observed as the lines between the two remain parallel at all times.|$|E

40|$|Atomistic {{simulations}} of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) as rotational bearings were performed. Molecular mechanics (MM) calculations {{show that the}} interlayer energy surface of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> is nearly flat. Thermal effects on <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> were studied with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at finite temperature. These simulations show that the interlayer corrugation against rotation, and hence the interlayer friction coefficient, is extremely small, suggesting the possible application of DWCNTs as wearless bearings.

The arm and headshell is a one-piece construction; the large-gauge aluminium tube interference-fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is <b>the</b> <b>bearing.</b> The tube is flat {{at the other end}} to provide for mounting the cartridge. The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint. Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever-operated lift/lower assembly.|$|E

Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snow shoeing, and snowmobiling.

50|$|In {{the second}} stage, <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> of Structures 1 through 5 were repaired.

50|$|The rotor is {{supported}} by <b>bearings,</b> which allow <b>the</b> rotor to turn on its axis. <b>The</b> <b>bearings</b> are in turn supported by the motor housing.

5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range.

50|$|In a piston engine, <b>the</b> main <b>bearings</b> are <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> {{on which}} <b>the</b> {{crankshaft}} rotates, usually plain or journal <b>bearings.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bearings</b> hold <b>the</b> crankshaft {{in place and}} prevent the forces created by the piston and transmitted to the crankshaft by the connecting rods from dislodging the crankshaft, instead forcing the crank to convert the reciprocating movement into rotation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bearings</b> {{concerned}} were roller bearings; {{each was}} designed to have 26 rollers inside, but because the supply of the rollers to the factory was delayed — while <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> had to be finished on time due to expiring contracts — each bearing had only 13 rollers.|$|R

5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces contact with <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, {{the ability to}} operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of {{cockatoos}} {{is even more}} limited than that of parrots in general, with only one truly ancient cockatoo fossil known: a species of Cacatua, most probably subgenus Licmetis, found in Early Miocene (16–23 million years ago) deposits of Riversleigh, Australia. Although fragmentary, the remains {{are similar to the}} western corella and the galah. In Melanesia, subfossil bones of Cacatua species which apparently did not survive early human settlement have been found on New Caledonia and New Ireland. <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> of these fossils on cockatoo evolution and phylogeny is fairly limited, although the Riversleigh fossil does allow tentative dating of the divergence of subfamilies.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a design basis adopted {{for the construction}} of a test facility for the rig testing of rolling <b>bearings.</b> One of <b>the</b> methods of inspection of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> is <b>the</b> testing of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> as components having already been mounted in a specific machine component unit and tested in the conditions of operation of the unit as a whole. This article presents preliminary engineering requirements and the design of a special test rig for the examination of rolling <b>bearings</b> without <b>the</b> necessity of mounting <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> in a specific machine component unit. The rig testing is widely used in consideration of numerous good points of such a method. The simulation testing of bearings (on test rigs) consists in reproducing as accurately as possible the real conditions of operation of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> when mounted in the device for which they are intended. The rigs used for such tests are complicated and expensive, but the results of such tests are more “reliable” and more accurately represent the impact of various operational factors (loads) on the durability of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> under test...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} {{determining the}} selection of rigidness of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> of high-speed machines have been defined; the fulfilment of the conditions minimize the dynamic components of the reactions of <b>the</b> elastically yielding <b>bearings.</b> It {{has been shown that}} the high-speed machining is expedient to be used only for the materials having a low degree of deformation at chip formation.

In this case the time base {{was not used to}} measure range, and the horizontal location of the blip was not important. Instead, the time base was used simply to help ensure <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> operator was looking at the same target as the range operator - the signal of interest would be somewhere close to centred.|$|E
25|$|Crank pin and {{crosshead}} bearings carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|E
