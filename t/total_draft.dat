40|$|By using {{analytical}} correlations derived as {{a result}} of theoretical research, a computer algorithm has been worked out for simulating the functions of the plough body and the forces exerted by soil upon the operating parts, as well as its draft resistance. These correlations allow to determine the draft resistance of the plough depending on the parameters of its body, as well as to evaluate the impact of the physical and mechanical properties of soil, such as friction upon it. The greatest influence upon the draft resistance is exerted by soil hardness, density and slip resistance along the surfaces of the operating parts. The latter is also affected by soil adhesion, which particularly manifests itself in wet clay soils at lower temperatures. It has been clarified that the friction resistance constitutes 46 – 62 % of the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> resistance of the plough body. The main ways of lowering the friction resistance and the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> resistance of the plough are the introduction of a more rational design of its body having optimum parameters, decreasing the resistance of the share-mouldboard surface and the values of reactions of the supporting surfaces, as well as the application of antifriction materials and better modes of joining with tractors...|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, as more farm power is being demanded on farms, due to {{increased}} farm sizes and operating speeds, larger and heavier farm machines are deployed in various farming operations. Their cumulative negative effects have become more apparent with increased incidences of soil compaction problems. This has forced many farmers to practice deep tilling, using subsoilers to break up compacted subsoil layers. In some maize growing regions of South Africa, conventional subsoilers are used in a tandem configuration. The farmers believe {{that the use of}} subsoilers in this mode reduces the draft force per unit area tilled. This probably happens because the critical depth for the rear subsoiler is increased beyond its working depth of 600 mm. Operating in this mode necessitated this study, with the ultimate goal of testing an appropriate existing force model for a single tine in predicting the force requirements of the front subsoiler in a tandem configuration. Secondly, to develop an alternative model for the rear subsoiler based on the three-dimensional failed soil-profile and to determine the relative position of the front subsoiler at which energy utilization is optimized. To develop the proposed model, an analytical approach based on limit equilibrium analysis was used and a Matlab-based computer program was coded to solve it. Its verification was conducted through field experiments in sandy clay loam soil. The experiments consisted of a continuous measurement of the horizontal and vertical forces acting on each subsoiler by a two-dimensional force transducer system. At the same time, the three-dimensional and thus the cross-sectional areas of the disturbed soil-profiles at different sections were measured, as well as the soil characteristics. A manual method employing a pin-profile meter was used to measure the vertical cross-sectional areas of the failed soil-profiles at 100 mm intervals. Further more, a technique using an automatic penetrometer and a computer program was developed to identify and map the three-dimensional failed soil-profiles. This technique indicated that the subsoiler failed the soil beyond its maximum operating depth and width. The results also indicated that the soil-failure pattern at close spacing is in phase at both subsoilers, leading to reduced <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force requirements. At a wider spacing, the soil-failure pattern was out of phase, thus resulting in increased <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force requirements. At the same time, the cross-sectional area tilled per unit draft force increased with increased spacing. This was because the failed maximum cross-sectional area increased in size faster than the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force as the spacing was increased. The proposed model verification results show that the predicted and recorded forces at the rear subsoiler correlated reasonably well at a wider spacing. When the front subsoiler was shallow working and close to the rear subsoiler, the model under- predicted the measured forces on the rear subsoiler, whilst the Swick-Perumpral model over predicted the applied forces to the front subsoiler and this was generally the case at wider spacings. Furthermore the efficiency of the subsoilers was maximized when the longitudinal spacing was such that it allowed the soil failed by the front subsoiler to stabilize before the rear subsoiler reached it. The maximum cross-sectional area failed per unit draft force was recorded when the depth of the front subsoiler was equal to about 80 % of the rear subsoiler-operating depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will not only facilitate qualitative field operations and optimize energy use, but also promote better management decisions.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} influence of the drawing process of TWIP steel wires on their mechanical properties and the structure changes. Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment of steel containing 29. 4 % manganese and little amount of carbon (0. 0049 %C) allows to obtain TWIP effect, and the austenitic structure for this type of steel was realized. In order to investigate the structure changes, the optical microscopy was used. Mechanical properties were determined by the compression test and drawing process. Findings: The analyses of changes of mechanical properties and the structure after particular drawings stages was carried out. At the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> of 93. 4 % the value of drawing stress was 1060 MPa, however further deformations of the wire brought relation Rm/R 0. 2 to be above 1. 6. Research limitations/implications: Continuation of the investigations with the use of transmission electron microscopy makes it possible to identify all phases that appear in this steel. Practical implications: Drawn products characterized by high strength properties together with good plasticity might be used for production of connecting elements because they can absorb large quantity of energy. Originality/value: For the first time there were obtained so high hardening level as well as so high plasticity in the drawing process...|$|E

40|$|Modified {{design of}} a planter to be {{attached}} to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this project. This research project {{was part of a}} larger project, called “Developing robotics assisted technology for farming”. The main motivation for this research project is the fact that mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed. Besides, it should require less draft force compared to existing planters so that it can be pulled by the mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding. To find the forces between soil engagement tool (disc coulter) and soil, experiments were designed and performed in the Linear Soil Bin at University of Saskatchewan. Disc and tilt angle of a disc coulter was changed and draft, vertical and side forces applied to it were measured to find the disc and tilt angle combinations that results in minimum draft force. Experiments showed that 7 ° disc angle and 25 ° tilt angle provides the least draft force compared to other disc angle and tilt angle combinations. Then, using the knowledge obtained from literature and the soil bin experiments, a planter was designed conceptually and in detail, based on the existing CNH planter. For further analyses computer modeling was performed. The whole planter was modeled in 3 D, using SolidWorks. Stress analysis was performed in ANSYS Workbench to calculate safety factor of the designed parts. Two prototypes were fabricated and were attached to the mobile robot for field tests. Tests were performed in indoor settings to measure the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force required to pull developed planters. Draft force was very close to the value that was calculated in design stage. Results showed that an average of 460 N pulling force is required to pull one row planter for 50 mm depth of cut, which can be compared to n existing CNH corn planter that requires a pulling force of between 900 N to 1300 N. Seed drop accuracy and function of the developed planters in opening and closing a packed soil in presence of residue, were also observed in outdoor tests...|$|E
40|$|The Las Vegas {{ground-water}} basin {{as described}} in this report includes {{the southern part of}} Indian Spring Valley, Three Lakes Valley, the northern half of Ivanpah Valley, and Las Vegas Valley. These valleys in part are inferred to form a hydrologic unit that includes an area of about 3, 000 square miles {{in the southern part of}} Clark County, Nev. The valleys forming the Las Vegas ground-water basin are broad structural depressions surrounded by mountains. The climate of the region is arid, and precipitation in the basin lowlands rarely exceeds 5 inches per year. Drainage is interior except for occasional Hood runoff and waste from the industrial plants at Henderson; the occasional flood runoff and waste flow through the Las Vegas Wash to Lake Mead. The mountain ranges are composed of indurated rocks that impede the movement of ground water from the basin and form the boundary of the ground-water reservoir. The valley fill that forms the principal ground-water reservoir is composed of a thick sequence ranging from Miocene (?) through Recent in age. Most of the ground water is in a large leaky artesian system comprising four principal zones of aquifers—the deep, middle, and shallow zones of artesian aquifers and the near-surface zone of water-table aquifers. To facilitate quantitative analyses of recharge, discharge, and yield, the aquifers have been divided arbitrarily into an artesian system, which includes the three principal artesian aquifers, and the near-surface water-table system. Natural recharge to the artesian system is from precipitation in the mountainswithin the drainage area of the basin. As ground water moves from areas ofrecharge toward areas of discharge in the lower parts of Las Vegas Valley, itbecomes confined between relatively impermeable beds. Nearly imperviousbarriers caused by faulting of the valley fill impede the lateral movement of the ground water. Artesian pressure causes the water to leak upward along thefaults into shallow aquifers. The average annual natural recharge to the Las Vegas artesian system was estimated by the following methods: (1) Estimation of consumptive use by phreatophytes under natural conditions prior to ground-water development; (2) estimation of ground-water underflow to the Las Vegas area during a period of near-stability in the ground-water reservoir; and (3) study of the relationship between precipitation and recharge during periods of equilibrium in the ground-water reservoir. Estimates of the natural recharge based on these methods suggest that the average annual natural recharge to the basin is on the order of 25, 000 acre-feet. The <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> on the artesian aquifers in 1955 was approximately 48, 000 acre-feet, of which about 42, 000 acre-feet was from wells and springs and about 6, 000 acre-feet was from upward leakage. Therefore, overdraft on the artesian reservoir in 1955 was about 23, 000 acre-feet. Recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was derived from upward leakage from the underlying artesian aquifers and by infiltration of waste water. The total estimated recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet. The draft on the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet, of which about 24, 000 acre-feet was discharged by phreatophytes and about 1, 000 acre-feet was discharged by wells. During this study, the near-surface reservoir was in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium. The above data indicate that the overdraft on the entire Las Vegas ground-water basin in 1955 was approximately equal to the overdraft on the artesian aquifers—that is, about 23, 000 acre-feet. As the artesian heads continue to decline in Las Vegas Valley, the quantity ofground water lost through upward leakage and subsequent transpiration willdecrease. Conditions of optimum development of the artesian system will beachieved when the artesian heads have been lowered to about 50 feet below land surface, because most of the upward leakage that is currently discharged by phreatophytes will have been eliminated. At the present rate of decline of the artesian head and with the present distribution and amount of withdrawals, the artesian head will be lowered sufficiently to prevent most natural discharge in the Las Vegas area in about 40 years and in the Paradise Valley area in about 75 years. The maximum sustained yield that can be developed from the artesian aquifers when the artesian head has been lowered below the root zone of phreatophytes will be limited to the approximate average annual natural recharge to the artesian system plus the amount of nonconsumptively used ground water and imported water which becomes available for reuse through downward leakage or artificial recharge. The accumulated annual discharge from the Las Vegas artesian aquifers hasexceeded the accumulated recharge since the development of the first successful well in 1906, and as a result the artesian pressure has declined almost uninterruptedly from year to year since that time. The artesian head in selected observation wells in the vicinity of Las Vegas and Paradise Valley declined about 30 feet between 1941 and 1956. During this time the approximate cumulative overdraft amounted to about 300, 000 acre-feet. The amount of overdraft per foot of lowering of artesian head within the area of approximately 40 square miles represented by the observation wells during this period was about 10, 000 acre-feet. The chemical quality of the ground water in Las Vegas Valley is, in general,better in the northern than in the southern part of the valley. In the northernpart of the valley, water from the shallow and middle zones of aquifers is of better quality than water in the deep zone of aquifers. As the ground water migrates southward into the Paradise Valley and the Whitney-Pittman areas, the water in the middle and shallow zones becomes more mineralized than the water in the deep zone of aquifers. The lowering of artesian head in the Las Vegas area between 1935 and 1950 has caused about 180 millimeters of local land subsidence in the vicinity of the Bonanza Street underpass, where the sediments are predominantly clay and silt. In the western part of the valley, where the sediments are predominantly sand and gravel, subsidence during the same period of time was negligible...|$|E
