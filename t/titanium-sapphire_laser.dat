25|$|Lasers {{can cause}} damage in {{biological}} tissues, {{both to the}} eye and to the skin, due to several mechanisms. Thermal damage, or burn, occurs when tissues are heated {{to the point where}} denaturation of proteins occurs. Another mechanism is photochemical damage, where light triggers chemical reactions in tissue. Photochemical damage occurs mostly with short-wavelength (blue and ultra-violet) light and can be accumulated over the course of hours. Laser pulses shorter than about 1 μs can cause a rapid rise in temperature, resulting in explosive boiling of water. The shock wave from the explosion can subsequently cause damage relatively far away from the point of impact. Ultrashort pulses can also exhibit self-focusing in the transparent parts of the eye, leading to an increase of the damage potential compared to longer pulses with the same energy. Photoionization proved to be the main mechanism of radiation damage at the use of <b>titanium-sapphire</b> <b>laser.</b>|$|E

40|$|Twenty {{years after}} it was proposed, STED nanoscopy has evolved into a {{powerful}} tool in far-field fluorescence imaging which achieves resolutions below 20 nm. Nevertheless, the application of STED nanoscopy in life sciences on a large scale is hindered by the high effort which the method requires. This effort is in great part due to the STED laser. So far, lasers which can be utilized for STED, e. g. <b>titanium-sapphire</b> <b>lasers,</b> show both, technical and practical shortcomings, resulting in complex nanoscopy systems. Semiconductor lasers which are compact, reliable and controllable without effort, are predestinated to improve this situation if they are adapted to meet the pulse requirements for STED. Therefore, this thesis examines the potential of different types of semiconductor lasers for STED. Fabry-Pérot laser diodes in overdriven gain switched operation are demonstrated to be suitable STED lasers. Even more suitable STED pulses, with pulse energies of up to 5 nJ in 1 ns, are obtained from a second semiconductor laser system. Based on a tapered amplifier, this system is constructed to be operated flexibly in various modes of ns pulse generation. With this semiconductor STED laser subdiffraction imaging of fluorescent nuclear track detectors is successfully performed for the first time. Thereby the size of tracks of carbon ions and protons in this material can be determined. Furthermore, a method for all-semiconductor picosecond-pulse generation at wavelengths of 532 nm, 561 nm and 593 nm is presented. This was so far not possible and provides a convenient source of excitation light for red emitting organic dyes, not only for STED nanoscopy.

40|$|The idea of terahertz-time-domain {{spectroscopy}} (THz-TDS) is {{to exploit}} a single cycle, spectrally broad THz radiation pulse to {{gain insight into}} the response of matter. Photoconductive devices and nonlinear crystals are utilized in both the generation {{as well as the}} coherent detection of THz radiation. The relatively high cost and the complexity of commonly used <b>titanium-sapphire</b> <b>lasers</b> hinder a more widespread use of pulsed THz systems for commercial applications. Er-doped femtosecond fiber lasers operating at 1. 55 μm could offer a viable alternative. In this thesis nonlinear crystals and photoconductive emitters are discussed for excitation in the near infrared (NIR) window of between 800 nm to 1550 nm. The main focus of this thesis is a detailed study of substrate materials for an interdigitated photoconductive antenna. Photoconductive antennas with microstructured electrodes provide high electric acceleration fields at moderate voltages because of small electrode separations. The scalability of these devices allows for large active areas in the mm^ 2 range, which are sufficient for excitation at large optical powers. In comparison with conventional emitter structures, these antennas have more favourable characteristics regarding THz power, spectral properties, and ease of handling. Depending on the utilized substrate material, photoconductive antennas can then be operated using different excitation wavelengths. By employing substrates with short carrier trapping times these antennas can be operated as THz-detectors. Moreover the design of electrode structures for generating radially and azimuthally polarized THz waves are presented. A second topic deals with the signal analysis and signal interpretation of THz pulses transmitted through several material systems. These experiments show the potential for tomographic and spectroscopic applications. The third part deals with THz emission by frequency mixing in nonlinear organic and inorganic crystals. Hereby the focus is on polaritonic phase matching in GaAs. Furthermore, indications of THz tunability by the excitation wavelength were found by utilizing waveguide structures. However, the observed tuning range is much lower then theoretically predicted. Specific reasons for this are discussed...|$|R

The fourth harmonic of a femtosecond <b>titanium-sapphire</b> (Ti:sapphire) <b>laser</b> (lambda ~= 205 nm) was found to cause three-photon pumping of O 2 to a level at 18. 1 eV. The parallel character of the observed O+ and O- images allowed us to conclude that dissociation takes place on the 3 Sigma u - ion-pair state. The 815 nm fundamental of the Ti:sapphire laser used as probe was found to cause two-photon electron photodetachment starting from the O 2 ion-pair state, giving rise to (O(3 P) +O+(4 S)) products. This was revealed by the observed depletion of the yield of the O- anion {{and the appearance of}} a new O+ cation signal with a kinetic energy Etransl(O+) dependent on the time delay between the pump and probe lasers. This time-delay dependence of the dissociation dynamics on the ion-pair state has also been simulated, and the experimental and simulated results coincide very well over the experimental delay-time interval from about 130 fs to 20 ps where two- or one-photon photodetachment takes place, corresponding to a change in the R(O+,O-) interatomic distance from 12 to about 900 Å.
