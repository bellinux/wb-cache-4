5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. <b>The</b> <b>speech</b> <b>of</b> a child with developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible {{to the point that}} daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E

5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>of</b> Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E

5|$|Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>of</b> a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins with}} Emmon, a lowland runaway, coming to Caspromant when Orrec and Gry are 16. The {{children}} tell Emmon of their gifts, {{though he is}} somewhat disbelieving of them. Orrec then narrates the history of his family from his childhood. His father Canoc is the brantor of Caspromant; his mother Melle, a woman from the lowlands. Despite living in the Uplands, Melle holds to some of her traditions, and teaches Orrec stories and lays that she had learned as a child. She also teaches him to read, an ability rare among Uplanders. Canoc also begins to instruct Orrec {{in the use of}} their power, though Orrec does not manifest any ability as a child. Orrec and Gry, of a similar age, become good friends, and Gry begins to show her power, being able to listen to <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>of</b> cats and mice.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>of</b> the capital, Phnom Penh, {{and that of the}} Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the Khmer Empire. The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the Khmer of Vietnam while the Khmer living in the remote Cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the Middle Khmer language.|$|E

5|$|With {{the ending}} of the Gupta Dynasty in {{northern}} India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>of</b> personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.|$|E

40|$|By {{examining}} <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> opponents, <b>the</b> work {{attempts to}} investigate what role {{they play in}} the unfolding narrative of Luke’s second volume.   In addition, the thesis attempts to probe Luke’s historiographic horizon by comparing his use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> opponents {{to that of other}} instances in biblical and Second Temple narrative literature. An introductory chapter proposes that the category of the “opponent” or “outsider” is a helpful grid through which to view the manner in which an author builds and strengthens the identity of a community in a historical document. Chapter two reviews research on <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> Acts from F. C. Baur to the present.   It is observed that the majority <b>of</b> studies on <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> have concentrated on matters of historicity and theology. With the work of Martin Dibelius, it is argued that a fresh avenue <b>of</b> research on <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> was opened, whereby a shift in scholarship slowly began to take place. Rather than focusing exclusively on the historicity of the discourses, scholars began to concentrate on <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> in Acts as a whole {{as well as on the}} historiographic orientation of Acts provided by <b>the</b> <b>speeches.</b> Chapters three to six are exegetical investigations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> opponents in Acts. Chapter seven examines <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponents of Israel in selected Hebrew and Second Temple Jewish narrative literature. The dissertation draws the following conclusions: Luke used <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> opponents as one of the channels through which to convey his own ideology.   This literary technique was built upon a theological/historiographical foundation that adhered to the following logic: if God’s control over the history of the Jesus movement was such that even the enemy – unwittingly – was helping in its propagation, then it truly must be a movement sanctioned by God.    The <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> non-Christians in Acts, therefore, are used as a legitimating factor for its readers.
