2500|$|Qualifications, {{commonly}} known as [...] "Quals," [...] is the first {{and one of the}} most important series events. Qualifications is a four lap race around the track to see which team can get the fastest cumulative time. These times determine if a team qualifies to race in Little 5 and if so, then where in the field of the top 33 teams they will be placed. Each team is given three attempts to qualify. The reason for this is in case a team faults an exchange, then they still have two more chances to qualify. The way that a team can fault an exchange is if one of its members falls and takes the bike down with her, or the team does not perform the exchange in the given distance, which is marked by white lines on the track. Or, in the case of a bike-to-bike exchange, if the second rider starts to move before she is tagged or if the first rider does not stop the bike before the last white line. Teams can use as many as four riders or as few as two riders. But whatever amount of riders a team uses to qualify is the least amount of riders they can use for Little 5. Meaning that if a team qualifies with four people, then they must race with four people. But if they qualify using only three people, then they can use <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>people</b> on the day of Little 5.|$|E
