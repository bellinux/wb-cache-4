5|$|Commerce {{continued}} to be {{an essential part of}} the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.|$|E

In August, Allen broke the CFL career record for fumbles recovered for touchdowns when he recovered his fifth blocked punt for a touchdown. Shortly afterward, he missed multiple games due to a sprained ankle. The Blue Bombers lost to the Toronto Argonauts 3–42 in the East Final.|$|E
5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional shipping center, the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through {{on their way to}} the mineral-rich Coeur d'Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> in North America.|$|E

5|$|Vilhelm Dahlerup {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> 19th-century architects. Perhaps {{more than}} anyone else, he contributed to the way Copenhagen appears today.

5|$|And Still I Rise {{is author}} Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, {{published}} by Random House in 1978.

Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was {{best known for her}} seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E

5|$|At age 15, Näslund {{played a}} season with Örnsköldsviks SK in Sweden's third-tier men's league. Appearing in 14games, he scored 7goals and 13points.

The pair helped Modo to win back-to-back junior championships. After a season of junior, in 1990–91 Näslund joined Modo's professional team in the Elitserien, Sweden's premiere league. The Modo equipment manager designated him with the jersey number 19, which Näslund thereafter opted to wear with the Swedish national teams he played on. He recorded 10goals and 19points in his rookie season, a record points total for a 17-year-old in the league, until Robert Nilsson scored 21 in 2002–03.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning {{will depend on the}} class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|Fothergill {{began his}} career as a club {{professional}} in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides.|$|E

Australia's form slumped along with that of Harvey, losing the next two Tests and the series 3–1. Harvey ended with 354 runs at 44.25 for the series. Despite this, he {{continued}} to productive in the other first-class matches and was by far <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> batsman in the 1954–55 Australian season, accumulating 1100 at 47.83 runs ahead of Les Favell's 663.

A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Johnson ranked third on the NFL's all-time rushing yards list when he retired, but was best remembered by his peers for the mark he left with his blocking. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> of his career. He {{was awarded the}} Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 {{for his work on}} colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E
30|$|The USA, Canada, and Germany were <b>the</b> {{top three}} <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> {{countries}} of forest ecology related research. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> three <b>productive</b> organizations were the University of California System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the US Forest Service. <b>The</b> three <b>most</b> <b>productive</b> funding agencies were the National Science Foundation, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
