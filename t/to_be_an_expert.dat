5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head {{the night before the}} murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E

His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three concepts: the physician's responsibility to patients and to self, and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.|$|E

25|$|Modern-day {{authorities}} disagree as to {{how much}} of Gerard's Herball was original. Garret made a chance visit to the Norton publishing shop, where he discovered the proofs of the Herball, and alerted the Nortons as both to errors he discovered in the proofs and to the incorporation of some of L'Obel's material in Gerard's new book. This story is recounted by L'Obel in his Stirpium illustrationes (1655) in which he accuses Gerard of plagiarism. Although they were not concerned about plagiarism, the Nortons, fearing errors in a book that was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> reference guide, hired L'Obel, as an internationally recognized expert on plants (who had as Gerard’s friend, unwittingly contributed to his book) to proof the translations, fix the mismatched illustrations, and right its textual wrongs. When Gerard discovered L'Obel's thankless efforts, he had him dismissed. Although Gerard was an experienced collector and plantsman, unlike L'Obel he lacked scholarship, as is evident in his dedication to Burghley, where he paints a picture of himself as a gardener. Gerard dismissed L'Obel's criticisms as being due to his unfamiliarity with English idioms. Norton decided to proceed with publication despite these difficulties. He decided against using Dodoens' original illustrations since this would have revealed the actual source of the material, but instead rented woodblocks from Nicolaus Bassaeus in Frankfurt, about 1,800 in all, only 16 being original. However, Gerard was then faced with the difficulty of matching them to the text and frequently mislabelled them.|$|E

When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt, Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place. He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882. Wyatt Earp was an imposing, handsome man: blond, [...] tall, weighing about , broad-shouldered, long-armed, and muscular.

Payne insisted, [...] "I think it's {{one of the best things}} we've done. ... It's exceeded my expectations." [...] In the arts pages of the Financial Times, Martin Hoyle wrote of Payne's [...] "exquisite tunnel vision" [...] and expressed [...] "the concern of those of us who value the true people's opera". Payne remained adamant that opera lovers who came to the ENO for a [...] "nice, pleasant evening ... had come to the wrong place."

40|$|In this thesis, I {{draw the}} {{attention}} {{to the role of}} ethical experts in the media. With regards to ethical experts there appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> certain special conditions and questions in play. My ambition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> illuminate and analyze which factors influence the concept of ‘ideal expertise’ when this kind of expertise becomes a part of the production process of one of the three biggest Danish daily newspapers with their short deadlines and limited physical space. In my analysis of two different definitions of expertise I derive a list of minimum requirements. Within the field of journalism, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> it <b>is</b> required that one has knowledge within a defined area, which may be academic, and that one is institutionally independent. Within the field of philosophy, however, I conclude that the requirements <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> <b>are</b> ethical knowledge and reasoning skills. It appears, when examining the empirical evidence, that most of these requirements are being met in the chosen focus of the media. However, the pressure of the production of the daily morning newspapers compromises the validity of the reasoning of ethical arguments. E. g., the limited space of the columns may make editors leave out essential parts of the line of reasoning or the perspective of the argument...|$|R
