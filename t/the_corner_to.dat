5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was {{acutely aware of the}} risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was {{included on the}} CD format of the single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting five minutes and 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to the brick wall and walking around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> find the vast Khodynka Field with a clearer cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E

25|$|On 4 December 2008 Karen Matthews and Michael Donovan {{were found}} guilty of kidnapping, false {{imprisonment}} and perverting the course of justice. The plan had been for Donovan to release Shannon at Dewsbury Market, drive around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> 'discover her' then take her to a police station and claim the £50,000 reward. This would be split between Donovan and Karen Matthews. On 23 January 2009, both were sentenced to eight years in prison by Mr Justice McCombe.|$|E
25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play is coming from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> {{the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, {{but it is difficult to}} lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> the point of starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E

25|$|The team regrouped {{and then}} went into the 1991 World Cup with a renewed attitude. In the pool games they beat Argentina, cruised to a 38–3 win over Wales, and beat Samoa 9–3 in a rain soaked game. During the quarter-final match against Ireland, Australia {{were never able to}} pull away from them. With {{literally}} seconds remaining on the clock, Ireland were up 18–15 before Michael Lynagh scored in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> break the hearts of the Irish and qualify for the semi-final against New Zealand. In the first half they raced to a 13–3 lead and then showed they could defend as the All Blacks pounded their line. They faced England in the final at Twickenham. England changed their usually forward-dominated game plan and attempted to play more of a running game. It was unsuccessful and Australia battled out a 12–6 win. David Campese was named player of the tournament having scored six tries in a series of outstanding performances. Victory parades were held back in Australia for their national team.|$|E
25|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard {{was for the}} NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. Barry Windham defended the title against Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes {{dominated}} Windham in the beginning by performing a Shoulder Block. Rhodes continued to perform several moves on Windham until the action spilled {{to the outside of}} the ring where Windham tried to perform a Piledriver on Rhodes but Rhodes countered it with a Clothesline. The action returned to the ring where Rhodes fought Windham until Windham's manager JJ Dillon distracted Rhodes, allowing Windham to take advantage and attack Rhodes. Windham applied a Clawhold on Rhodes and started getting near-falls. Rhodes eventually fought out of the Clawhold and tried to apply a Figure Four Leglock but Windham countered and applied another Clawhold. Rhodes eventually climbed <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> prevent Windham for getting the leverage and tried to perform a Superplex but Rhodes pushed him into the referee. Rhodes performed a Bionic Elbow on Windham and attempted to pin him but the referee was knocked out. Ron Garvin interfered in the match and attacked Rhodes with a Punch. Dillon woke up the referee and Windham pinned Rhodes to retain the title.|$|E
500|$|Rapinoe {{was named}} to the United States roster for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. During the team's second group stage match against Colombia, she entered the match during the 50th minute and scored almost {{immediately}} to put the United States up 2–0. Rapinoe celebrated her goal by running to <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> the left of Colombia's goal, picking up an on-field microphone being used for the match's television broadcast, tapping it, and singing Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A."

500|$|Mabel {{used his}} weight {{advantage}} {{to gain the}} early advantage in his match with Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett gained momentum when he tripped Mabel and performed a fist drop and two double axe handles from the ropes. On two occasions, Jarrett jumped on Mabel's back to perform sleeper holds, but Mabel backed him into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> escape both times. Mabel attempted to perform a splash from the second rope but missed. Jarrett attempted a sunset flip, which Mabel tried to counter by sitting on him. Jarrett {{moved out of the}} way and quickly pinned Mabel to win the match.

500|$|The {{filming of}} the episode's ending caused a [...] "huge divide among the writing {{staff and the}} {{director}} and the cast". Carell, Kwapis, and the actors wanted the moment when Pam and Jim kiss to [...] "follow the characters and the emotion of the moment" [...] by having the action captured in full by the show's cameramen. The writing staff, on the other hand, wanted Pam and Jim's moment to be private and only heard via the mics; Daniels explained, [...] "The writing staff was itching to do something kind of weird [...] and have it be a private moment that the doc crew didn't know {{was going to happen}} and so only heard on their mics and came running around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> film." [...] Eventually, both versions were filmed, but the former was broadcast. The alternate version has never been released.|$|E
500|$|From the Red River Settlement, {{the trail}} went south {{upstream}} along the Red River's west bank to Pembina, {{just across the}} international border. Pembina had been a fur-trading post since {{the last decade of}} the eighteenth century. [...] From there, some traffic continued south along the river, but most cart trains went west along the Pembina River to St. Joseph near the border and then south, or else cut <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> the southwest in order to intercept the southbound trail from St. Joseph. This north-south trail paralleled the Red River about thirty miles (50km) to the west. [...] By staying on the uplands west of the Red River, this route avoided crossing the tributaries of that river near their confluences with the Red, and also kept out of the swampy, flood-prone, and mosquito-ridden bottomlands in the lakebed of Glacial Lake Agassiz which the river drained.|$|E

500|$|Canada {{took the}} lead only 1:54 into the game on a goal by J. P. Parise, but Petrov replied short-handed at 3:16 {{to tie the game}}. Petrov stole the puck from Frank Mahovlich and broke away and deked Tony Esposito to score. After a strong fore-check by the Canadians on the Soviets in their zone, Ratelle scored to put Canada ahead 2–1 after the first. Wayne Cashman dug the puck out of a scrum in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> feed the puck to Phil Esposito who scored to put Canada ahead 3–1. On another Canadian power play, Kharlamov was {{circling}} behind the Canadian defence and received a pass to put himself on a breakaway. Kharlamov deked Tony Esposito to score the Soviets' second short-handed goal. Paul Henderson scored seconds later to restore the two-goal lead, on an individual effort. The Soviets' [...] "Youngster's Line" [...] of Yuri Lebedev, Vyacheslav Anisin and Alexander Bodunov then scored two goals to tie the game at 4–4 after two periods.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Lewis {{called them}} [...] "more {{interesting than the}} first game, but marginally so", and Meuller called them [...] "dated", with environments seeming [...] "bland and drab, and the enemies [...] generic". The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations, but cited the environments as bland and felt that there were too few FMVs and too many game engine-driven cutscenes, which he described as [...] "awful". Parkin criticized the game's graphic capacities, commenting that players would [...] "stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> guide your character towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords.", while Jarvis said {{that it had not}} improved from the previous game and called the colors [...] "very murky, drab and dark". 1UP said that the graphics [...] " [...] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia's other titles like [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> see if the cops were coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers {{think of him as a}} coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E

500|$|Next {{they had}} their bye round, before facing the Wellington Hurricanes at Athletic Park. Despite leading 143 at half time, the Highlanders lost when Hurricanes' half-back Jason Spice scored in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> give the Hurricanes a 2119 victory. Had the Highlanders won they would have {{finished}} top {{of the table and}} hosted a semi-final at Carisbrook. Instead they then had to travel from Wellington to South Africa to play the Stormers. After trailing 110, the Highlanders finished the first half ahead 2218. They scored a further 11 points in the second half to win 3318. The Highlanders travelled back to Dunedin and the match was moved to the Sunday to allow an extra for recovery. The 1999 Super 12 Final was against South Island rivals the Canterbury Crusaders, and was billed as [...] "the party at Tony Brown's house" [...] after Highlanders first five-eighth Tony Brown. The match in front of a sellout 41,500 person crowd the Highlanders scored first, and led 149 at half time. However, the decisive try was to Crusaders' wing Afato So'oalo when he chipped the ball, then out-sprinted All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson to collect the ball and score. Although the Highlanders' scored a try to Isitolo Maka with three minutes remaining the Crusaders won 2419.|$|E
500|$|Quaife-Hobbs focused {{himself on}} holding off the closing Evans, Nasr and Calado. Dillmann {{was forced to}} go two laps behind the leader on the seventh lap after he {{sustained}} car damage. Bird was in seventh but was challenged by Ceccon who put his car on the line entering the Novelle Chicane forcing Bird to overshoot <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> avoid colliding with him. Bird was aware that his move would entail a drive-through penalty and thus yielded seventh place to Ceccon. Bird was immediately attacked by Richelmi but it became evident that Bird's car was suffering from a major problem. Bird lost further positions before entering the pit lane for technical assistance that put him one lap behind the race leader. He thus set the fastest lap of the race on supersoft tyres but as he was outside of the top ten he did not score the point entailed by the achievement. Palmer overtook Canamasas on lap 13 in a carbon-copy move to Abt's manoevure on Haryanto in the previous day's race. But on this occasion both drivers continued without any significant damage. Quaife-Hobbs was able {{to fend off the}} three-car train and appeared stronger as the race progressed and the tyres degraded.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1999 the Highlanders improved on their 1997 season record by reaching and hosting the tournament final. They opened their {{season with a}} 19–13 victory over the Auckland Blues at Carisbrook. This {{was followed by a}} victory over the Northern Bulls, the Stormers at Carisbrook, and the Cats, before their first loss of the season to the Sharks. They returned to New Zealand to defeat the Waikato Chiefs and then the Crusaders. After defeating the Reds, the Highlanders lost to the New South Wales Waratahs at Carisbrook. The next week they defeated the Brumbies at the same venue. In their next match, despite leading the Wellington Hurricanes 14–3 at half time, the Highlanders lost when Hurricanes half back Jason Spice scored in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>to</b> give the Hurricanes a 21–19 victory. Had the Highlanders won they would have finished top of the table and hosted a semi-final at Carisbrook. Instead they then had to travel to South Africa where they defeated the Stormers 33–18. The Highlanders travelled back to Dunedin for the 1999 Super 12 Final, which was against South Island rivals the Canterbury Crusaders, and was billed as [...] "the party at Tony Brown's house" [...] after Highlanders first five-eighth Tony Brown.
