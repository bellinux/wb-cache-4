5|$|Gert {{continued}} to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm, and reached a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). Gert made landfall just 6miles (10km) {{to the southeast}} of Pánuco, still at peak intensity, at 10:00p.m. CDT (0000 July 25, UTC). However, due to its interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25, and became a remnant low twelve hours after <b>that.</b> <b>Six</b> hours later, just a day after it made landfall, it dissipated over the mountains of central Mexico.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Rodney Gomes {{modelled}} {{the orbits}} of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found <b>that</b> <b>six</b> of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted.

5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found <b>that</b> <b>six</b> of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more <b>that</b> <b>six</b> years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E

5|$|The Representation of the People Act {{was passed}} in 1918 which gave women {{over the age of}} 30, who met a {{property}} qualification, the right to vote.

The government believed <b>that</b> <b>six</b> million voters would be added by the 1918 Act, in Wales the electorate rose from 430,000 to 1,172,000.|$|E

In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland.

It was decided <b>that</b> <b>six</b> of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels {{could be used for}} the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too poor a condition for use, and the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain tunnels would be bypassed with rock cuts through the mountains; The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.|$|E

5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the review board narrowed the tenders {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided <b>that</b> <b>six</b> submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed <b>that</b> <b>six</b> to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Each sabre {{squadron}} {{is approximately}} 90-strong, and {{is divided into}} three troops (Water Troop, Free-Fall Troop and Vehicle Mounted Troop). A troop comprises four patrols with five or six operators in each patrol, and is commanded by a captain with each patrol commanded by a sergeant. For surveillance operations the SASR usually operates in patrols; however, for CT operations it usually employs larger force elements. Support personnel include signallers, mechanics and technicians, medical staff, storemen, drivers, caterers and various specialists. It was reported in 2012 <b>that</b> <b>six</b> female soldiers were being trained in the United States. As of 2003, 152 Signal Squadron comprised four troops. Military dogs, designated Special Operations Military Working Dog (SOMWD), have been members of the SASR since 2005, seeing service in Afghanistan and have their own memorial.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, McNair took an axe to {{the armored}} {{division}} organization, dramatically downsizing it. For {{all but the}} 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions, the number of armored battalions was reduced to three. Devers favored the older, larger organization. The surplus armored battalions were utilized as separate armored battalions, so {{by the end of}} 1943 there were 54 armored battalions in armored divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By this time, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been dramatically cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten armored divisions were required, and he suggested <b>that</b> <b>six</b> of the sixteen armored divisions already active be broken up. This proposal was not accepted, and the number of armored divisions was frozen at sixteen.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the Invalid Corps {{was given}} the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was {{difficult}} to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola {{wrote a letter to}} George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them. Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War <b>that</b> <b>six</b> months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the Invalid Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest. Nicola sent letters about the situation to Washington, who wanted to have it settled as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. Washington, who did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter.|$|E
