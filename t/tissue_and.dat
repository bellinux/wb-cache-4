The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis 'Public Opinion Toward the <b>Tissues</b> <b>and</b> Organs Removal for Transplantation Purposes', as {{the title}} suggests, aims at examining the public opinion on the given topic. The objective of the paper was to research how the society perceives the removal of <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> organs, {{as well as the}} level of public awareness in this field. The bachelor thesis is divided into the theoretical and practical part. The theoretic part is dealing with the current conditions of the <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> organs removal for the purposes of transplantation. This part is divided into three main chapters. Main topics covered by the bachelor thesis are the medical, ethical and legal issues related to the <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> organs removal. The aim of the practical part was to examine the public opinion on the removal of <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> organs for the purposes of transplantation. Another objective was to find out whether the society is sufficiently informed about the issue, mainly from the legal point of view. Given the fact that the law 285 / 2002 Sb. (the transplant law), which has changed the field fundamentally, was introduced almost 12 years ago, I was interested whether the public has sufficient information on the principles of the assumed agreement with the organ <b>and</b> <b>tissue</b> removal. The two determined hypotheses were: Hypothesis 1. The public agrees with the removal of <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> organs for the purposes of transplantation as a way of saving someoneÂ´s life. Hypothesis 2. The majority of respondents {{does not want to be}} registered in the National Register of Persons Refusing Posthumous Donation of <b>Tissues</b> <b>and</b> Organs (NROD). The thesis highlighted some issues concerning the removal of <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> organs for the purpose of transplantation and examined opinions and the level of knowledge of the public in the health-related, ethical and legal matters...|$|R

5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic {{articular}} cartilage paste grafting is a surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions.

5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
5|$|A {{saturation}} {{profile is}} one {{which all the}} tissues considered by the decompression model have become saturated with inert gas from the breathing mixture. Most decompression models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> will not affect the decompression required.|$|E

It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.|$|E

In situ gelatin zymography was used to detect collagenolytic activities. The productions of MMP 1, TIMP 1 and gelatinolytic activities were compared in cell cultures from tendinosis samples <b>and</b> controls. Tendinosis <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> cultures showed {{an increase in the}} expression level of MMP 1 and a decrease in that of TIMP 1, a condition favoring collagen degradation.

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable <b>tissue)</b> <b>and</b> skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of <b>tissue,</b> <b>and,</b> from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt {{proposed}} {{they were}} ground doves, based on studies of a dodo skull he had rediscovered {{in the royal}} Danish collection of Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but later supported by Strickland and Melville, who suggested the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848, after dissecting the only known dodo specimen with soft <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> comparing it with the few solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones, features which were otherwise known only in pigeons.|$|E
50|$|A {{balanced}} {{salt solution}} (BSS) is a solution made to a physiological pH and isotonic salt concentration. Solutions most commonly include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride. Balanced salt solutions are used for washing <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> cells and are usually combined with other agents to treat the <b>tissues</b> <b>and</b> cells. They provide the cells with water and inorganic ions, while maintaining a physiological pH and osmotic pressure.|$|R

Results of another phylogeographic {{study indicate that}} southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern part}} of Central Africa are genetically closer to lions in North and West Africa, and those in the southern part closer to lions in Southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid <b>tissue</b> <b>and</b> hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E
