50|$|Edward sneaks off to <b>the</b> White <b>Bitch's</b> {{castle and}} refuses to tell her where the others are. She flashes him her breasts, hypnotizing him into giving up the {{information}} on the orphans, then imprisons him. <b>The</b> White <b>Bitch</b> sends Silas after the trio; Tumnus apparently sacrifices himself to ensure their safety. Afterwards, the orphans meet a graying Harry Potter (Kevin McDonald), along with a balding Ron Weasley (George Alvarez) and a pregnant Hermione Granger (Crista Flanagan) at Hogwarts, and other characters from famous movies. They all help Lucy, Susan, and Peter train for the war against <b>the</b> White <b>Bitch.</b> Meanwhile, <b>the</b> White <b>Bitch</b> reveals her plans to create a new continent for her followers via a magic crystal. Edward escapes with the assistance of Captain Jack Swallows (Darrell Hammond), only to find out it was a ruse as Jack, <b>the</b> <b>Bitch's</b> old enemy, needs intelligence out of Edward. Jack is then stabbed by <b>the</b> White <b>Bitch</b> as <b>the</b> magic crystal is thrown in the ocean and grows, putting <b>the</b> <b>Bitch's</b> plan in motion.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to find out {{alteration}} in physiological and haematological parameters in bitches affected with pyometra. Materials and methods: Physiological and haematological parameters were studied in twenty eight bitches affected with pyometra. Results: Evaluation of physiological parameters revealed that rectal temperature and respiration rate were increased in <b>the</b> <b>bitches</b> affected with pyometra where as heart rate did not reveal any significant change. In haematological parameters, haemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC) and lymphocyte count were decreased in <b>the</b> <b>bitches</b> affected with pyometra. The total leucocyte count (TLC), neutrophil count and monocyte count were increased in pyometra. Erythrocytic indices like mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) did not show any significant changes in <b>the</b> <b>bitches.</b> Conclusion: Normocytic and normochromic anaemia, leucocytosis, a predominant absolute neutrophilia, lymphopenia and monocytosis were the most common findings in all <b>the</b> <b>bitches</b> affected with pyometra.

25|$|Earlier than that, he {{had begun}} to branch out into Mastiffs, selling John Wigglesworth Thompson the brindle bitch Juno, who would be the {{foundation}} of his line. Thompson would later make him a gift of a young dog called Tiger, generally known as George's Tiger, who would become an important stud dog. George also provided both the foundation animals, Adam (bought by George at Tattersalls) and Eve (bought by George at Leadenhall Market), for Captain Garnier. (Adam was reputed {{to be one of the}} Lyme Hall mastiffs, from the region of Forest of Lyme, Cheshire.

40|$|Twenty-two bitches with ultrasonographically {{diagnosed}} spontaneous pyometra {{were treated}} {{with a combination of}} 5 microg/kg cabergoline per day and 5 mug/kg cloprostenol every third day, and potentiated sulphonamide twice a day. Bitches with either open-cervix or closed-cervix pyometra showed a rapid clinical improvement, associated with a reduction in plasma progesterone concentration, increased vulval discharge and a reduction in the diameter of the uterus. The haematological profiles of 21 of <b>the</b> <b>bitches</b> returned to normal within six days of treatment, and their biochemical profiles returned to normal within nine days; 19 of <b>the</b> <b>bitches</b> were managed successfully by a 10 -day period of treatment. Two bitches required a further three days of treatment, and in one bitch with a partial uterine torsion the treatment was not successful. Adverse effects of the treatment were limited to the 60 minutes immediately after the administration of prostaglandin, and included retching, vomiting, mild abdominal straining, diarrhoea and panting. The incidence of adverse effects was reduced after each successive dose of prostaglandin. Eleven of the 21 successfully treated bitches were mated at the next oestrus, and seven became pregnant; their litters were smaller than the published breed averages. In four of <b>the</b> <b>bitches</b> <b>the</b> pyometra recurred after the next oestrus...|$|R
500|$|The second segment parodies Moses who, {{according}} to the Book of Exodus, freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has {{the role of the}} Pharaoh. When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus, the burning bush tells him that Bart did it. When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims [...] "No, the bush set me up!" [...] Bart's line refers to the 1990 arrest of Marion Barry who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine, exclaimed [...] "No, <b>the</b> <b>bitch</b> set me up!" [...] In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by Yahweh, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus. While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called [...] "Orb of Isis" [...] and played a big part in the season 9 episode [...] "Lost Our Lisa". In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film The Ten Commandments, in which Moses parts the Red Sea. The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie.|$|E

2500|$|Reaching back to {{the dozens}} and dirty blues, early rappers like Slick Rick {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>bitch</b> as a character: a woman, often treacherous, but sometimes simply déclassé.
