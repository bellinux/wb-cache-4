30|$|In the low-frequency range (less {{than a few}} tens of Hertz), {{the normal}} and <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> of the finger pad are not {{decoupled}} and collectively affect the deformation at the finger side. The normal deformation of the finger pad also leads to skin deformation at the finger side. Hence, a large normal deformation in the low-frequency range may interfere with the estimates of the <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> of the finger pad. At high frequencies, the adverse effects of the normal deformation on the estimates of <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> are minute, because this effect of normal deformation on the radial side is attenuated [22]. From this aspect, at a frequency range of less than a few tens of Hertz, the estimation method based on the tangential force is regarded as being better than our accelerometer-based method, although further comparisons {{would be necessary to}} draw a firm conclusion.|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of various {{electronic control units}} in modern vehicles, such as the anti-lock brake systems, the traction control systems, and the electronic stability control have improved vehicle performance and stability. Design and tuning of such control units requires large amounts {{of trial and error}} modifications as well as experiments. Therefore the need for accurate and computationally efficient models has increased {{to meet the demands of}} vehicle handling simulations for designing various control units. Tire-terrain model forms the center piece of such vehicle model development. This thesis aims at developing a discrete, lumped-parameter, physical model for capturing transient interactions between a deformable tire and a deformable terrain. Specifically, the model accounts for the radial and the <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> in the tire as well as the normal and the <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> of terrain. Furthermore, the model captures onset and loss of contact, localized stick and slip phases for each of the discrete elements of the tire.

A simple FE three phase growth ring model is in good agreement with the experimental values. The selective activation of individual phases like earlywood, transitionwood and latewood demonstrates that the radial hygro-expansion is dominated by the earlywood deformation, whereas <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> is a complex interplay of expansion and compression that needs all tissues to fully develop...|$|E

Four roughness structures are considered: one-dimensional sinusoidal and two-dimensional sinusoidal seal roughness structures both without and with a tangential seal surface displacement. The tangential seal surface displacement is chosen asymmetric with the axial position in the contact.

Four different regimes of breakage have been identified and the energy dissipated by the agglomerate upon impact has been determined for each regime of breakage. A comparison between the energy dissipated by the breakage of individual interparticle contacts and the net loss of kinetic energy has shown that the rupture of interparticle bonds utilises less than 10 % of the total kinetic energy dissipated during agglomerate impact for all cases analysed here.

40|$|The {{boundary}} {{behavior of}} axisymmetric microswimming squirmers is theoretically explored within an inertialess Newtonian fluid for a no-slip interface {{and also a}} free surface in the small capillary number limit, preventing leading-order surface deformation. Such squirmers are commonly presented as abridged models of ciliates, colonial algae, and Janus particles and we investigate the case of low-mode axisymmetric <b>tangential</b> surface <b>deformations</b> with, in addition, the consideration of a rotlet dipole to represent torque-motor swimmers such as flagellated bacteria. The resulting boundary dynamics reduces to a phase plane in the angle of attack and distance from the boundary, with a simplifying time-reversal duality. Stable swimming adjacent to a no-slip boundary is demonstrated via the presence of stable fixed points and, more generally, all types of fixed points as well as stable and unstable limit cycles occur adjacent to a no-slip boundary with variations in the <b>tangential</b> <b>deformations.</b> Nonetheless, there are constraints on swimmer behavior - for instance, swimmers characterized as pushers are never observed to exhibit stable limit cycles. All such generalities for no-slip boundaries are consistent with observations and more geometrically faithful simulations to date, suggesting the tangential squirmer is a relatively simple framework to enable predications and classifications for the complexities associated with axisymmetric boundary swimming. However, {{in the presence of}} a free surface, with asymptotically small capillary number, and thus negligible leading-order surface deformation, no stable surface swimming is predicted across the parameter space considered. While this is in contrast to experimental observations, for example, the free-surface accumulation of sterlet sperm, extensive surfactants are present, most likely invalidating the low capillary number assumption. In turn, this suggests the necessity of surface deformation for stable free-surface three-dimensional finite-size microswimming, as previously highlighted in a two-dimensional mathematical study of singularity swimmers. © 2013 American Physical Society...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the microstructure details and the mechanical response under uniaxial compression of a strongly aggregating colloidal dispersion. The numerical simulations account for short-range interparticle attraction, normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> at particle contacts, sliding and rolling resistance (RR), and preparation conditions. The compression rates are small so that hydrodynamic interactions are negligible. In {{the absence of}} RR, the average coordination number varies only slightly with compaction while the variation is significant in its presence. The particle contact distribution is isotropic throughout the consolidation process, irrespective {{of the magnitude of}} the parameters. In this limit of strong aggregation, the elastic modulus is a weak function of the magnitude of attraction. It is shown that the yield strain does not change significantly during the entire consolidation process, and the value in the presence of RR is marginally higher than in its absence. However, the yield stress increases with volume fraction which is a direct consequence of the increased elastic modulus. The yield stress, both in the presence and absence of RR, scales similarly with volume fraction. The overall power law exponent of 5. 7 of the yield stress in the presence of RR as a function of volume fraction is in good agreement with previous simulation results.

40|$|Most animal {{cells are}} {{surrounded}} by {{a thin layer of}} actin meshwork below their membrane, commonly known as the actin cortex (or cortical membrane). An increasing number of studies have highlighted the role of this structure in many cell functions including contraction and locomotion, but modelling has been limited {{by the fact that the}} membrane thickness (about 1 mm) is usually much smaller than the typical size of a cell (10 – 100 mm). To overcome theoretical and numerical issues resulting from this observation, we introduce in this paper a continuum formulation, based on surface elasticity, that views the cortex as an infinitely thin membrane that can resists <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation.</b> To accurately model the large deformations of cells, we introduced equilibrium equations and constitutive relations within the Eulerian viewpoint such that all quantities (stress, rate of deformation) lie in the current configuration. A solution procedure is then introduced based on a coupled extended finite element approach that enables a continuum solution to the boundary value problem in which discontinuities in both strain and displacement (due to cortical elasticity) are easily handled. We validate the approach by studying the effect of cortical elasticity on the deformation of a cell adhering on a stiff substrate and undergoing internal contraction.

40|$|Cilia and flagella are hair-like {{appendages}} that protrude {{from the}} surface of a variety of eukaryotic cells and deform in a wavelike fashion to transport fluids and propel cells. Motivated by the ubiquity of non-Newtonian fluids in biology, we address mathematically the role of shear-dependent viscosities on both the waving flagellar locomotion and ciliary transport by metachronal waves. Using a two-dimensional waving sheet as model for the kinematics of a flagellum or an array of cilia, and allowing for both normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> of the sheet, we calculate the flow field induced by a small-amplitude deformation of the sheet in a generalized Newtonian Carreau fluid up to order four in the dimensionless waving amplitude. Shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids are seen to always induce opposite effects. When the fluid is shear-thinning, the rate of working of the sheet against the fluid is always smaller than in the Newtonian fluid, and the largest gain is obtained for antiplectic metachronal waves. Considering a variety of deformation kinematics for the sheet, we further show that in all cases transport by the sheet is more efficiency in a shear-thinning fluid, and in most cases the transport speed in the fluid is also increased. Comparing the order of magnitude of the shear-thinning contributions with past work on elastic effects as well as the magnitude of the Newtonian contributions, our theoretical results suggest that the impact of shear-dependent viscosities on transport could play a major biological role.

40|$|AbstractIn {{previous}} work about axisymmetric adhesive contact on power-law graded elastic materials, the contact interface was often {{assumed to be}} frictionless, which is, however, {{not always the case}} in practical applications. In order to elucidate the effect of friction and the coupling between normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>deformations,</b> in the present paper, the problem of a rigid punch with a parabolic shape in non-slipping adhesive contact with a power-law graded half-space is studied analytically via singular integral equation method. A series of closed-form analytical solutions, which include the frictionless and homogeneous solutions as special cases, are obtained. Our results show that, compared with the frictionless case, the interfacial friction tends to reduce the contact area and the indentation depth during adhesion. The magnitude of the coupling effect depends on both the Poisson ratio and the gradient exponent of the half-space. This effect vanishes for homogeneous incompressible as well as for linearly graded materials but becomes significant for auxetic materials with negative Poisson’s ratio. Furthermore, influence of mode mixity on the adhesive behavior of power-law graded materials, which was seldom touched in literature, is discussed in details...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the individual and collective dynamics of neutral squirmers are presented. “Squirmer” refers to a class of swimmers driven by prescribed <b>tangential</b> <b>deformations</b> at their surface, and “cneutral” means that the swimmer does not apply a force dipole on the fluid. The squirmer model is used in this article to describe self-propelled liquid droplets. Each swimmer is a fluid sphere in Stokes flow without radial velocity and with a prescribed tangential velocity, which is constant in time in the swimmer frame. The interaction between two or more swimmers is taken into account through the relaxation of their translational and angular velocities. The algorithm presented for solving the fluid flow and the motion of the liquid particles is based on a variational formulation written on the whole domain (including the external fluid and the liquid particles) and on a fictitious domain approach. The constraint on the tangential velocity of swimmers can be enforced using two different methods: penalty approach of the strain rate tensor on the particles domain, or a saddle-point formulation involving a Lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint. This leads to a minimization problem over unconstrained functional spaces that can be implemented straightforwardly in a finiteelement multi-purpose solver. In order to ensure robustness, a projection algorithm is used to deal with contacts between particles. Two-dimensional numerical simulations implemented with FreeFem++ are presented...|$|R

Solving this problem is a key step toward effective performance capture for the entertainment industry, but progress so far has been hampered by the lack of appropriate local motion and smoothness models. The main technical contribution of this paper is {{a novel approach}} to regularization adapted to nonrigid <b>tangential</b> <b>deformations.</b> Concretely, we estimate the nonrigid deformation parameters at each vertex of a surface mesh, smooth them over a local neighborhood for robustness, and use them to regularize the tangential motion estimation. To demonstrate the power of the proposed approach, we have integrated it into our previous work for markerless motion capture [9], and compared the performances of the original and new algorithms on three extremely challenging face datasets that include highly nonrigid skin deformations, wrinkles, and quickly changing expressions. Additional experiments with a dataset featuring fast-moving cloth with complex and evolving fold structures demonstrate that the adaptability of the proposed regularization scheme to nonrigid tangential motion does not hamper its robustness, since it successfully recovers the shape and motion of the cloth without overfitting it despite the absence of stretch or shear in this case...|$|R
40|$|In several biologically {{relevant}} situations, cell locomotion {{occurs in}} polymeric fluids with Weissenberg {number} larger than one. Here we present results of three-dimensional numerical simulations for the steady locomotion of a self-propelled {{body in a}} model polymeric (Giesekus) fluid at low Reynolds number. Locomotion is driven by steady <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> at {{the surface of the}} body (so-called squirming motion). In the case of a spherical squirmer, we show that the swimming velocity is systematically less than that in a Newtonian fluid, with a minimum occurring for Weissenberg numbers of order one. The rate of work done by the swimmer always goes up compared to that occurring in the Newtonian solvent alone, but is always lower than the power necessary to swim in a Newtonian fluid with the same viscosity. The swimming efficiency, defined as the ratio between the rate of work necessary to pull the body at the swimming speed in the same fluid and the rate of work done by swimming, is found to always be increased in a polymeric fluid. Further analysis reveals that polymeric stresses break the Newtonian front-back symmetry in the flow profile around the body. In particular, a strong negative elastic wake is present behind the swimmer, which correlates with strong polymer stretching, and its intensity increases with Weissenberg number and viscosity contrasts. {The velocity induced by the squirmer is found to decay in space faster than} in a Newtonian flow, with a strong {dependence} on the polymer relaxation time and viscosity.

40|$|The {{northern}} Rehamna massif, {{halfway between}} Marrakech {{to the south}} and Casablanca to the north, constitutes part of the Hercynian segment of the coastal Meseta, in which it is exposed as a nucleus surrounded by post-orogenic sediments of Autunian (?), PermoTriassic (?) and Cretaceous age. The massif is composed of two great structural domains separated by an important thrust zone. The western domain is a little-deformed Cambro-Ordovician foreland; it is considered to represent a relatively autochthonous terrain. Its western margin is one of imbricated wedges, the so-called "wedges of Oued Tarfa". The eastern domain is composed of a thick sequence of superposed thrust sheets, including those of Sidi Abdallah (with Ordovician to Devonian rocks), Skikirat (with Devonian ta Visean rocks), and Gada Jenabia (with Visean rocks only). These units have undergone a polyphase tectonic-metamorphic evolution which stands in strong contrast with that of the western domain. The western domain comprises 6 sedimentary units of detrital character, dated Middle Cambrian to Arenigian. Their paroxysmal deformation resulted in the formation of Fl-folds characterized by their approximately N-S orientation, their km-scale amplitude and half-wave length, their upright cylindrical nature and law angle of plunge, and the contemporaneous development of cleavageThe wedges of Oued Tarfa are composed of rocks identical to those of the western domain. The F 1 structures are of the same type, but were truncated and thrust NW-ward during the same period of <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation.</b> The width of caver is 2 - 6 km, depending on the wedge. The Sidi Abdallah thrust sheet is composed of 10 formations ranging in age from Ordovician (?) to Devonian. Their paroxysmal deformation gave rise to a symmetric to overturned F 1 -folds with NW vergence and steep NE plunge, formed contemporaneous with metamorphism and the development of schistosity. The intensity of deformation and metamorphism increases toward the E, where F 2 and F 3 -folds make their appearance. The first thrust episode (φ 1) placed the Sidi Abdallah thrust unit on top of the western domain and imbricated the unit. The displacement was ta the NW and amounted to a minimum of 8 km. A second thrust episode (φ 2) with S-ward displacement in turn gave rise to minor imbrications. The Skikirat thrust sheet is composed of nonmetamorphic rocks of Lower to Middle Devonian and upper Visean age. The first tectonic event appears to have {{led to the development of}} olistoliths; the subsequent paroxysmal deformation gave rise to F 1 -folds whose orientations are at present highly variable and which are characterized by a weak-S 1 cleavage. The first episode of <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> caused displacement towards the NW, but is not widely observed. The second thrust event carried the Skikirat unit S-ward on top of the preceding units including the western domain. The displacement amounts to several km, locally as much as tens of km. The evidence of two distinct thrust periods in the northern Rehamna massif, following their discovery in the Jebilet massif and the southeastern Rehamna massif, demonstrates that these events played a highly important role in the late Hercynian tectogenesis of the Moroccan Meseta. Le massif hercynien des Rehamna septentrionales est constitué de deux grands domaines structuraux actuellement séparés par un important contact de recouvrement. A l’Ouest s’observe le domaine occidental autochtone au moins relatif. C’est un avant-pays à matériel cambro-ordovicien puissant, simplement déformé en vastes plis droits. La marge orientale de ce domaine est écaillée (écaille de l’oued Tarfa). A l’Est s’étend un domaine oriental, constitué de plusieurs grandes unités chevauchantes dont les deux premières ont été étudiées : l’unité de Sidi Abdallah à matériel ordovico(?) – dévonien et au-dessus l’unité de la Skikirat à matériel dévono-viséen. Ces unités ont subi une évolution tectono-métamorphique polyphasée qui contraste très fortement avec le domaine occidental. Le serrage hercynien a d’abord donné lieu à des épisodes de plissement P 1 synschisteux et synmétamorphes, P 2 et P 3 (kinks). Ensuite un premier épisode de tectonique tangentielle a amené sur le domaine occidental l’unité de Sidi Abdallah entraînant les écailles de l’oued Tarfa para-autochtone. Les déplacements, du Sud-Est vers le Nord-Ouest sont au minimum décakilométriques. Un second épisode de tectonique tangentielle mais à déplacement du Nord vers le Sud, avec une flèche minimale également décakilométrique, conduit à la superposition de l’unité de la Skikirat à la fois sur le domaine occidental, les écailles de l’oued Tarfa et de l’unité de Sidi Abdallah. Après avoir été mise en évidence dans le Jebilet et dans les Rehamna méridionales, des deux épisodes tangentiels sont ainsi également connus dans le Rehamna septentrionales. Il s’agit donc là de phénomènes importants, voire majeurs, dans la structuration hercynienne de la Meseta marocain...|$|E
40|$|In wall-bounded {{turbulent}} flows, {{determination of}} the wall shear stress is an important task. A primary objective of the present research {{is to develop a}} sensor which is capable of measuring the surface shear stress over an extended region applicable to turbulent flows. The sensor, as a direct method for measuring the wall shear stress, enables us to conduct measurements in a relatively large domain with high spatial resolution in a non-intrusive way. The sensor consists of mounting a thin flexible film on the solid surface and is made of a homogeneous, isotropic, and incompressible material. The geometry and mechanical properties of the film are measured, and particles are embedded on the film’s surface to act as markers. An optical technique is used to measure the film deformation caused by the flow field. For this purpose, the film is imaged at the flow-off and flow-on states and then multi-grid cross correlation digital particle image velocimetry is used to measure the <b>tangential</b> <b>deformation</b> with high sub-pixel accuracy. The film has typically deflection of less than 2 % of the material thickness under maximum loading. The sensor sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the thickness of the layer or the shear modulus of the film’s material. The thesis provides detailed information for the experimental methodology developed in the Laboratory for Turbulence Research in Aerospace and Combustion (LTRAC) at Monash University. It presents the sensor concept, governing equations, sensor fabrication, static calibration, precise dynamic response evaluation, followed by the accuracy assessment, and a description of capabilities and limitations. The static calibration confirms that fabricated films are linear elastic solid. The assessment of the dynamic response of the sensor shows low pass filter behaviour for most of the created films. Measurements of the wall shear stress have been performed in a fully developed turbulent channel flow with Reynolds numbers in the range of 2, 100 - 2, 900 based on the friction velocity and the half channel height. The results are compared with alternative wall shear stress measurement methods and also with the wall shear stress data available in the literature. For comparison of the mean wall shear stress and skin friction, the logarithmic law of the mean streamwise velocity profile obtained from the PIV experiments has been utilised. In addition, oil-film interferometry as a reliable and accurate technique to measure the local mean wall shear stress has been employed. The comparisons represent favourable agreement between the mentioned measuring approaches. In addition, a recent DNS turbulent channel flow at the Reynolds number of 2, 300 has been used for comparison of the wall shear stress statistics and flow topological analysis. For dynamic wall shear stress measurements, a film with the shear modulus of 80 Pa and 2 mm in thickness has been used. The spatial resolution is 9 - 12 wall units and the measurement domain is approximately 1200 × 1500 l+ for the highest Reynolds number case. The distribution of the fluctuating wall shear stress reveals the co-occurrence of low- and high-shear regions aligned in the streamwise direction. It indicates the imprint of existing streaky structures in the near-wall region. The conditionally averaged field of low-shear stress regions exhibits the counter rotating vortex pattern elongated in the streamwise direction. It suggests the signature of long quasi-streamwise vortices or stretched legs of hairpins as the dominant structures existing in the immediate vicinity of the wall. In brief, the thesis presents detailed information on further progress of an in-house film-based shear stress method and its first application to a wall bounded turbulent flow to measure the instantaneous wall shear stress distribution...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} for the computation of harmonic maps, and respectively, of the harmonic map heat flow between two closed Riemannian manifolds. Our approach {{is based on}} the totally geodesic embedding of the target manifold into R^N. Since embeddings of Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean spaces can easily be made totally geodesic by extending the Riemannian metric in a certain way into some tubular neighbourhood, the here presented approach is quite general. Totally geodesic embeddings allow to reformulate the harmonic map heat flow in a neighbourhood of the embedded target manifold. This reformulation has the advantage that the problem becomes unconstrained: Instead of assuming a priori that the solution to the flow maps into the target manifold this fact becomes a property of the solution to the extended flow for special initial data. The solution space to the reformulated problem therefore exists of maps which are also allowed to map into the ambient space of the target manifold. This simplifies the discretization of the problem. Based on this observation, we here propose algorithms for the computation of the harmonic map heat flow and of harmonic maps. In contrast to previous schemes, our algorithm does not make use of projections onto the target manifold, discrete <b>tangential</b> <b>deformations,</b> geodesic finite elements or of Lagrange multipliers. We prove error estimates in the stationary case and present some numerical tests {{at the end of the}} paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} {{of a rock}} mass due to temperature decrease below freezing is very complex, since many factors are involved; thermal strain, strain due to stress change, stress re-distribution, ice formation and the temperature dependency of rock mechanical and thermo-physical properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to achieve a better understanding of the rock mass response to thermo-mechanical loading when storing low temperature products in rock caverns excavated in hard crystalline rock masses. The study includes a literature survey, a hypothesis, a series of laboratory tests, a pilot scale field test and an analysis. In order to investigate the rock mass response to thermo-mechanical loading, rock specimens in the laboratory were tested at low temperatures. A pilot scale rock cavern, with a height of 15 m and a diameter of 7 m, was tested under refrigerated conditions. In the laboratory, rock cores taken from the field test area were investigated in order to estimate compressive strength, tensile strength, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and the coefficient of thermal contraction as a function of decreased temperature. The pilot scale test cavern was refrigerated for about 5 months. Temperatures and deformations were measured frequently during the cooling period. Radial deformations and temperatures were measured in the rock cavern, as well as in the host rock mass. <b>Tangential</b> <b>deformations</b> were measured at the mid-height of the cavern. Stress changes were recorded in the vicinity of the rock wall. In total, the rock instrumentation system consisted of 193 instruments...|$|R
