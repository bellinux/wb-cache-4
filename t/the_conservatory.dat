5|$|Baltimore's {{most famous}} {{institute}} of higher music {{education is the}} Peabody Institute's Conservatory of Music, founded in 1857 though instruction did not begin until 1868. The original grant from George Peabody funded an Academy of Music, which became <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> in 1872. Lucien Southard was the first director of <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> In 1977, <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> became affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|Among Mahler's fellow {{students}} at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, {{with whom he}} formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable {{to submit to the}} strict disciplines of <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.|$|E
50|$|Composer Juozas Naujalis {{founded a}} music school in 1919 in Kaunas. This school was reorganised into <b>the</b> Kaunas <b>Conservatory</b> in 1933. In 1949 <b>the</b> Kaunas <b>Conservatory</b> and <b>the</b> Vilnius <b>Conservatory,</b> founded in 1945, were merged into <b>the</b> Lithuanian State <b>Conservatory.</b> <b>The</b> State <b>Conservatory</b> was renamed <b>the</b> Music Academy of Lithuania (LMA) in 1992, and in 2004 {{it became the}} Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre (LMTA).|$|R

50|$|He {{studied at}} <b>the</b> Moscow <b>Conservatory</b> under Sergei Taneyev. He taught at <b>the</b> Kiev <b>Conservatory</b> until 1919, <b>the</b> First Music Tekhnikum in Moscow, which he founded, and <b>the</b> Moscow <b>Conservatory.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Saint Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev {{developed}} a reputation as a musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed himself on the piano. In 1909, he graduated from his class in composition with unimpressive marks. He continued at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory,</b> studying piano under Anna Yesipova and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin.|$|E
5|$|Busoni's first son, Benvenuto (known as Benni), {{was born}} in Boston in 1892, but Busoni's {{experience}} at New England Conservatory proved unsatisfactory. After a year he resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> and launched himself {{into a series of}} recitals across the Eastern USA.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Khachaturian {{entered the}} Moscow Conservatory to study {{composition}} under Nikolai Myaskovsky and orchestration under Sergei Vasilenko. In 1933, he married the composer Nina Makarova, {{a fellow student}} from Myaskovsky's class. He finished <b>the</b> <b>conservatory</b> in 1934 {{and went on to}} complete his graduate work in 1936.|$|E

50|$|Lucy {{preferred}} to enlarge <b>the</b> greenhouse <b>conservatories</b> {{rather than to}} undertake extensive redecoration of the White House. The billiard-room, which connected the house with <b>the</b> <b>conservatories,</b> was converted into an attractive greenhouse and the billiard table consigned to the basement. Shuttered windows in the State Dining Room could then be opened for dinner guests to look into <b>the</b> <b>conservatories.</b> This eliminated <b>the</b> billard table which many Americans regarded as either a gambling device or a rich man's toy.|$|R
5|$|In March 1884, an Imperial Order {{abolished}} the navy office of Inspector of Bands, and Rimsky-Korsakov was relieved of his duties. He worked under Balakirev in the Court Chapel as a deputy until 1894, which {{allowed him to}} study Russian Orthodox church music. He also taught classes at the Chapel, and wrote his textbook on harmony for use there and at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year as director of <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory,</b> and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate {{in which he would}} write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

5|$|Szigeti quickly {{showed a}} talent for the violin. Several years later, his father took him to Budapest to receive proper {{training}} at <b>the</b> <b>conservatory.</b> After a brief stint with an inadequate teacher, Szigeti auditioned at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music and was admitted directly into the class of Jenő Hubay, without the usual delays and formalities.|$|E
5|$|The campus also {{operates}} two restaurants. The Gatehouse Restaurant offers contemporary dishes using regional ingredients, and the Bakery Café by illy serves sandwiches, soups, salads, breads, desserts, and hot beverages {{prepared by}} students in the college's baking and pastry arts degree program.

5|$|The grounds {{were laid}} out by Humphry Repton (1752–1818) a leading {{landscape}} gardener. Parts of Repton's designs still exist, notably the carriage drive which winds its way from the house, sections of which follow the original route.

5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, {{to be replaced by}} Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E
5|$|Loving's early {{adulthood}} involved several stints in the U.S. Army as a musician, and later regimental bandleader. A later {{period of study}} at the New England Conservatory of Music ended when Loving decided to rejoin the Army over the protests of his professors, who believed his talent as a cornetist would be wasted. After withdrawing from <b>the</b> <b>conservatory,</b> Loving was given command of the band of the 45th United States Volunteer Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski started {{piano lessons}} in Warsaw {{for two years}} {{from the age of}} six. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother {{returned}} to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's Third Symphony deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931 he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory.</b> His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from <b>the</b> <b>Conservatory</b> in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann's Toccata and Beethoven's fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.|$|E
