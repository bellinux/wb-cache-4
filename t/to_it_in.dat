5|$|A.abrupta is {{the type}} species of the section Lepidella of the genus Amanita, in the {{subgenus}} Lepidella, a grouping of related Amanita mushrooms characterized by their amyloid spores. Other North American species in this subgenus include A.atkinsoniana, A.chlorinosma, A.cokeri, A.daucipes, A.mutabilis, A.onusta, A.pelioma, A.polypyramis, A.ravenelii, and A.rhopalopus. European and Asian species (also in section Lepidella) that are phylogenetically related—close <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the evolutionary family tree—include A.solitaria, A.virgineoides, and A.japonica.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E
5|$|An Unforgettable Summer was {{especially}} {{noted for its}} depiction of oppression, nationalism and xenophobia, and for its investigation of violence in both interwar Romania and the Balkans. It is also connected {{with the end of}} Communist Yugoslavia and the onset of the Yugoslav wars: Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location, and continued to refer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> later interviews.|$|E

5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a way that prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, {{but it was not}} until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
5|$|During the Interregnum, Portland Castle {{continued}} to be garrisoned and used a prison, with a unit of 103 men attached <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1651. It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1653, seeing action in a three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he reduced the garrison to its pre-war levels but repaired the fortifications {{in the light of}} the continuing Dutch threat; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Waugh {{accepted}} {{a fee of}} £250 from the BBC for an adaptation of Pinfold, as a radio play, by Michael Bakewell. The broadcast, on 7 June 1960, was well received by the critics, although Waugh did not listen <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> September 1977 a staged version of the book, written by Ronald Harwood and directed by Michael Elliott, opened at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester. The play was brought to London, and performed at the Roundhouse Theatre in February 1979, where Michael Hordern's depiction of Pinfold was highly praised—"a man suffering from chronic indigestion of the soul".|$|E

5|$|In 1964 Chaplin {{established}} his official filmography {{with the publication}} of his book, My Autobiography. The filmography consisted of 80 motion pictures released since 1914. Further detail was added <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> David Robinson's 1985 biography, Chaplin: His Life and Art, which included Chaplin's last film, A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), as the 81st entry. In 2010 the 82nd film was added with the discovery of A Thief Catcher, an early Keystone film hitherto thought lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, a French film, Flammes sur l'Adriatique (Adriatic Sea of Fire) was made, {{portraying the}} scuttling of Zagreb {{and the events}} leading up <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> 1973, the President of Yugoslavia and wartime Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero to the two {{officers}} who scuttled Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|In their 1914 Flora of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} to {{the tree}} species that was then known as Ficus suffocans, a name that had been assigned <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> August Grisebach's Flora of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. maxima for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama. Since this use has become widespread, Berg proposed that the name Ficus maxima be conserved in the way DeWolf had used it, a proposal that was accepted by the nomenclatural committee.|$|E
5|$|Late on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army {{prepared}} for its forthcoming counterattack. Leibstandartes advance had disrupted Rotmistrov's preparations, as the assembly areas {{he intended to}} use for the tank army's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands {{by the end of}} the day, forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions. The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling across, and the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making {{one of the first}} scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E

5|$|Remains of Megalomys audreyae {{were found}} by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900. The exact {{locality}} is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as {{another member of}} the Megalomys group, but he never published a description of the latter. Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum. In 1926, Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory's wife Audrey, following Major's intention.|$|E
