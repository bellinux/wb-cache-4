500|$|Headfirst Productions {{originally}} intended {{for a much}} larger, nonlinear RPG-type storyline to be fitted within the game, including more characters and locations, {{as well as a}} cooperative gameplay system for up to four players. The latter would have enabled the players <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>one</b> of four characters and either carry out their own investigation independently or team up with the others (in case of single-player gameplay, the other three investigators would be under AI control). A multiplayer version of the game would have allowed for online deathmatch battles in specifically designed levels. Several other ambitious features, such as a deeper sanity system and a high degree of environment interactivity, were also scrapped due to budget and time constraints and problems with the level design. The game was always supposed to use first-person view, but the screenshots from 2001 showed some third-person view and stealth gameplay elements. Much of a promised [...] "wide array of weapons" [...] at the player's disposal was conceived but ultimately removed from the game, including a wooden club, a Mauser C96 pistol, and a pump-action shotgun.
