5|$|On January 22, 2012, Giffords {{announced}} that she would resign from her congressional seat in order to concentrate on her recovery, but promised to return to public service in the future. She submitted her resignation on January 25 on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> in an emotional appearance; colleagues and the House leadership offered their tributes to her courage and strength.|$|E

On a trip from her hiding place to find water, she was arrested by a policeman, but not prosecuted. The same month she became an {{employee}} of the WSPU and began to write for Votes for Women.|$|E
5|$|Support for the PC party saw a big bounce when Williams became leader.

In September 2001, Liberal Assemblyman (MHA) Ross Wiseman crossed <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Assembly to join the Progressive Conservative caucus. During his time as Opposition Leader, Williams donated his {{legislative}} salary to charity.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} formal apology, {{on behalf of}} the sitting Cabinet, in front of an {{audience}} of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC, for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a Committee of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority {{with the support of the}} opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves that ended in a duel. On <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor James Watson Webb. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb's honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky Congressman Richard Menefee and Virginia Congressman Richard Wise asked Crittenden {{to serve as a}} second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the censure of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.|$|E

5|$|Often blamed {{by those}} who deemed the act a crime was British {{financial}} writer Ernest Seyd, who had given advice as to {{the text of the}} bill, as attested by Congressman Hooper on the House floor in 1872. Seyd, according to this theory, was the agent of a group of British holders of American bonds, who had sent Seyd to America with ₤100,000 (then about $550,000) to bribe congressmen into demonetizing silver. Kelley denied this had taken place, but the story stuck, and became a common belief in the silver movement. In 1890, Seyd's corrupt involvement was asserted on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives by Arkansas's Thomas C. McRae. Seyd was in fact an ardent bimetallist who strongly objected to the American demonetization of silver. He had submitted, at Hooper's request, an analysis of the bill in the course of which he advocated retaining the silver dollar as a legal tender.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the bill on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether {{there had been}} a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
