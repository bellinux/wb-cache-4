50|$|The Cheetah's chassis was {{constructed}} of Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) cro-moly tubing that was heliarc welded (more {{commonly referred to}} as TIG or <b>tungsten</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> <b>welding)</b> using a P&H Mining DAR-200 welder. The design of the car was unusual in that it was front engined, but with the engine sitting so far back in the chassis that the output yoke of the transmission connected directly to the input yoke on the differential, basically making the driveshaft only a universal joint linking the transmission with the differential. With the engine positioned in this manner, the driver's legs were beside the engine. The exhaust system headers passed {{over the top of the}} driver's and passenger's legs. The tops of the footboxes were curved to make room for Edmunds' handmade headers. This design takes the attributes of what is known as an FRM layout to an extreme. Consequently, this design gave a front/rear weight distribution roughly approximating a mid-engined vehicle without the cost of an expensive transaxle arrangement. This design style resulted in a hot driver's compartment - an issue that would impact the Cheetah's performance on the track.|$|E

In order to simulate the abrupt maneuvers, wind bursts, motor vibration and helixes efforts, which generate cyclic bending loadings at the welded joints of a specific aircraft component called "motor cradle", experimental reverse bending fatigue tests were carried out on specimens made from hot-rolled steel plate, 1. 10 mm (0. 043 in) thick, by mean of a SCHENK PWS equipment, with load ratio R =- 1, under constant amplitude, at 30 Hz frequency and room temperature.
