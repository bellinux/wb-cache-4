500|$|The New York Sun gave a {{critical}} review, stating that [...] "Mr. Woodward so drowns the reader in clutter that few arguments, except the obvious, emerge." [...] As well, The New Republic {{alleged that the}} figures in the book were portrayed better if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to Woodward beforehand.|$|E
2500|$|The album also {{includes}} the cover song [...] "Total Eclipse", which was originally sung by German singer Klaus Nomi. Plate and singer AnNaR. of Rosenstolz discovered that they were both fans of Nomi when they first met, and since the formation of their band, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about recording a cover version of [...] "Total Eclipse".|$|E

2500|$|... 7 July - A {{large number}} of over a dozen {{students}} of the Venezuelan National Youth Organization who were having a hunger strike in a Chiquinquirá Catholic church stopped their fasting after 17 days, saying that intimidation from the National Guard and SEBIN, along with a siege of the church by paramilitary groups permitted by Venezuelan state authorities caused them to conclude their strike. However a few students continued their fasting. Parents protested in Valencia against Resolution 058 calling it the [...] "plan of the Fatherland". Citizens of Simón Planas in Lara state protested against insecurity, saying that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to government officials about the issue but the situation did not improve.|$|E
2500|$|With turnout {{expected}} not to {{be higher}} than 10%, or 25,000 or so votes, both Chus were working to ensure their constituents turned out on election day. The general election was considered less relevant than the primary by the voters, with the Judy Chu campaign acknowledging that many of the voters <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> to thought the primary in May {{was the end of the}} election. [...] While Judy Chu was pushing to ensure loyal Democrats come to the polls, Betty Chu worked to get Republicans, unmotivated to show up by the district's Democratic tilt, to flock to the polls and perhaps pull off a long-shot upset. Over 10,000 absentee ballots were filed, with about half from Democrats, a third from Republicans, and the remaining from unaffiliated voters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{television}} show Family was born in Aaron Spelling's kitchen, where he and Leonard Goldberg {{came up with the}} idea about a show that centered on the emotional life of a family. They pitched the idea to Allen and she liked it. Allen spent two weeks at the Beverly Hills Hotel while she knocked out a script. Len and Aaron loved it; it was touching and had marvelous moments of compassion, and was exactly what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about in the kitchen. The pilot was great, but ABC didn't buy it. It wasn't until two years later that ABC entered a production deal with Mike Nichols, who turned down all their ideas in favor of the script for Family that his Connecticut neighbor Jay Allen had shown him. It was Nichols who brought in Mark Rydell for the pilot which premiered at 10:00pm on March 9, 1976; the series went on to run for four years and 86 episodes. Later in life Allen would remark about television: [...] "I hate it, I hate it because the buck doesn't stop anywhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>talks</b> with Muhammad. The {{delegation}} {{before their}} departure embraced Islam and renounced Christianity without compunction.

6000|$|... "Please to come in, sir; {{the countess}} {{will be right}} glad to see you, and so will Miss Gertrude. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> of you {{hundreds}} of times, and wondered {{what had become of}} you." [...] She opened the door again with the great key, and led the way into the house.|$|R

2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> and {{struggled}} till {{they were both}} wearied out.|$|E
60|$|So, when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{about it}} for a quarter of an hour, it was agreed that they would sail with Captain Ichabod.|$|E
6000|$|... "I grieve to say, miss, {{that the}} servants, all but two, have given notice {{and want to}} leave the house today. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> the matter over among themselves; the butler has spoken for the rest. He says as how they are willing to forego their wages, and even to pay their legal {{obligations}} instead of notice; but that go today they must." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just an hour," [...] said Clara Demijohn, who {{was still}} looking out of Mrs. Duffer's window. [...] "What can <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been <b>talking</b> about?" ...|$|R

60|$|But Mabel did {{not take}} any notice of him. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> at her and round her for so many years, that she hardly heard them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{learned that}} you got Lance out of trouble," [...] she said after <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> a while. [...] "One way and another, he's deeply in your debt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do yeh think o' Cleveland's {{chances for}} a second term?" [...] {{continued}} the man, as if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been <b>talking</b> politics all the while.|$|R

60|$|Two noble {{women of}} the Society of Friends have lately been taking the gauge of {{suffering}} and misery in our land, visiting the hospitals at every accessible point, pausing in our great cities, and going in their purity to those midnight orgies where mere children are being trained {{for a life of}} vice and infamy. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> with these poor bewildered souls, entangled in toils as terrible and inexorable as those of the slave-market, and many of whom are frightened and distressed at the life they are beginning to lead, and earnestly looking for the means of escape. In the judgment of these holy women, at least one third of those with whom <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> are children so recently entrapped, and so capable of reformation, that there would be the greatest hope in efforts for their salvation. While such things are to be done in our land, is there any reason why any one should die of grief? One soul redeemed will do more to lift the burden of sorrow than all the blandishments and diversions of art, all the alleviations of luxury, all the sympathy of friends.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> been <b>talking</b> earnestly about {{past and}} present, for the son {{had much to}} learn about old friends and comrades, and the mother had much to tell.|$|R

The brothers <b>have</b> stated that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>talks</b> with John Turturro about reprising his role as Fink, but they were waiting [...] "until he was actually old enough to play the part." ...|$|R
