50|$|Larger {{condensers}} {{are also}} used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled vapor into liquid distillate.

50|$|A surface {{condenser}} {{is an example}} of such a heat-exchange system. It is a shell and tube heat exchanger installed at the outlet of every steam turbine in thermal power stations. Commonly, the cooling water flows through the tube side and the steam enters <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> where the condensation occurs {{on the outside of the}} heat transfer tubes. The condensate drips down and collects at the bottom, often in a built-in pan called a hotwell. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> often operates at a vacuum or partial vacuum, produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate. Conversely, the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside.|$|E

50|$|The hot {{fluid in}} the case of the rising film {{evaporator}} would be the steam in <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> and the cold fluid would be the liquid inside the long tubes. In relation to the overall heat transfer rate, there are several key parameters that affect this characteristic specifically in terms of a rising film evaporator.|$|E
50|$|The tubular module design uses {{polymeric}} membranes cast on {{the inside}} of plastic or porous paper components with diameters typically in the range of 5 - 25 mm with lengths from 0.6 - 6.4 m. Multiple tubes are housed in a PVC or steel shell. The feed of the module is passed through the tubes, accommodating radial transfer of permeate to <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> This design allows for easy cleaning however the main drawback is its low permeability, high volume hold-up within the membrane and low packing density.|$|E

5000|$|Horizontal falling film {{evaporators}} have {{a number}} of potential advantages over their vertical counterparts in the petrochemical industry, such as the ability to use tubes with external enhancements. ( [...] Internally enhanced tubes are available for vertical falling film evaporators, but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling film evaporators is that if a corrosive or fouling liquid is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.|$|E
5000|$|There can be many {{variations}} on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side. This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> so the fluid does not take a short cut through <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{exchangers}} {{with only}} one phase (liquid or gas) on each side can be called one-phase or single-phase heat exchangers. Two-phase heat exchangers {{can be used to}} heat a liquid to boil it into a gas (vapor), sometimes called boilers, or cool a vapor to condense it into a liquid (called condensers), with the phase change usually occurring on <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> Boilers in steam engine locomotives are typically large, usually cylindrically-shaped shell-and-tube heat exchangers. In large power plants with steam-driven turbines, shell-and-tube surface condensers are used to condense the exhaust steam exiting the turbine into condensate water which is recycled back to be turned into steam in the steam generator.|$|E

40|$|There {{are some}} {{disadvantages}} {{in the traditional}} segmental baffle heat exchanger for the transversal fluid flow in its <b>shell</b> <b>side,</b> such as <b>the</b> high flow resistance, large heat transfer dead region, and so on. For overcoming those above disadvantages, a kind of new efficient and energy saving shell-and-tube heat exchanger with sidelling flow in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> is developed, <b>the</b> traditional segmental baffles are substituted by leading type shutter baffles, therefore, the fluid in some local regions flows over tubes inclinedly. The velocity distribution and velocity variation at the same position of main flow region in sidelling flow heat exchanger and segmental baffle heat exchanger is studied and compared. It is confirmed that, with the leading type shutter baffles in <b>shell</b> <b>side,</b> <b>the</b> vortex in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> is weaken, flow field is greatly homogenized, and <b>the</b> velocity in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> is increased. Shutter baffles are helpful to reduce the pressure drop in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> and increase effective heat transfer area, which provides references for structure improving of shell-and-tube heat exchanger...|$|R
5000|$|The side {{electrode}} (also {{known as}} the [...] "ground strap") is made from high nickel steel and is welded or hot forged to the <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> metal <b>shell.</b> <b>The</b> <b>side</b> electrode also runs very hot, especially on projected nose plugs. Some designs have provided a copper core to this electrode, so as to increase heat conduction. Multiple side electrodes may also be used, so that they don't overlap the central electrode.|$|R
50|$|Two fluids, of {{different}} starting temperatures, {{flow through the}} heat exchanger. One flows through the tubes (the tube side) and the other flows outside the tubes but inside the shell (<b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side).</b> Heat is transferred from one fluid to the other through the tube walls, either from tube side to shell side or vice versa. The fluids can be either liquids or gases on either the shell or the tube side. In order to transfer heat efficiently, a large heat transfer area should be used, leading {{to the use of}} many tubes. In this way, waste heat can be put to use. This is an efficient way to conserve energy.|$|E
50|$|Kettle {{reboilers}} (Image 1) {{are very}} simple and reliable. They may require pumping {{of the column}} bottoms liquid into the kettle, or there may be sufficient liquid head to deliver the liquid into the reboiler. In this reboiler type, steam flows through the tube bundle and exits as condensate. The liquid {{from the bottom of}} the tower, commonly called the bottoms, flows through <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the tube bundle from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the tube bundle is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|E
50|$|For {{a rising}} film evaporator, the main paths of heat {{transfer}} are conduction and convection. These occur as the steam in <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> heats up {{the tube and}} as the tube heats up the liquid and vapour within. The design of the long vertical tubes in rising tube evaporators promote {{the formation of the}} long, thin and continual film of liquid formed by the pressure exerted by the vapour which occupies the centre part of the tube and rises up. This ascending motion of film and vapour in the centre promotes great turbulence which then allows for higher heat transfer coefficients leading to a better efficiency heat transfer. Another significant factor that affects the value of the heat transfer coefficients is the design of the evaporator.|$|E

50|$|A rising film or {{vertical}} long tube evaporator {{is a type}} of evaporator that {{is essentially}} a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger. The liquid being evaporated is fed from the bottom into long tubes and heated with steam condensing {{on the outside of the}} tube from <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side.</b> This is to produce steam and vapour within the tube bringing the liquid inside to a boil. The vapour produced then presses the liquid against the walls of the tubes and causes the ascending force of this liquid. As more vapour is formed, the centre of the tube will have a higher velocity which forces the remaining liquid against the tube wall forming a thin film which moves upwards. This phenomenon of the rising film gives the evaporator its name.|$|E
50|$|That {{water flowing}} through the steam {{generator}} boils water on <b>the</b> <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> (which is kept at a lower pressure than the primary side) to produce steam. This {{is referred to as}} the secondary loop. The secondary-side steam is delivered to the turbines to make electricity. The steam is subsequently condensed via cooled water from a tertiary loop and returned to the steam generator to be heated once again. The tertiary cooling water may be recirculated to cooling towers where it sheds waste heat before returning to condense more steam. Once-through tertiary cooling may otherwise be provided by a river, lake, or ocean. This primary, secondary, tertiary cooling scheme is the basis of the pressurized water reactor, which is the most common way to extract usable energy from a controlled nuclear reaction.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{has focused on}} the use of coil heat {{exchangers}} (CHEs) with microencapsulated phase change material (MPCM) slurries to understand if CHEs can yield greater rates of heat transfer.

The heat transfer results have shown that when using a MPCM slurry, an increase in heat transfer rate can be obtained when compared to heat transfer results obtained using straight heat transfer sections. It has been concluded that the increased specific heat of the slurry as well as the fluid dynamics in helical coil pipes are the main contributors to the increased heat transfer...|$|R

40|$|Lightweight {{structures}} are increasingly used for high-speed ships. This paper presents a systematic approach to analyse the structural behaviour of a lightweight deckside shell system using high strength steel. An analytical model of <b>the</b> deckside <b>shell</b> system was first given, {{which includes the}} effects of stiffeners for <b>the</b> deck and <b>side</b> <b>shell,</b> <b>the</b> support conditions of the centreline girder (CL-girder), the influence of transverse beams, and the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> and <b>the</b> lightweight deck as parts of problems to the solution. By changing several geometric parameters, the sensitivity of both overall and local stress and deflection for <b>the</b> deckside <b>shell</b> system was investigated. The different geometric parameters analysed comprise the influence for variation in {{the thickness of the}} web for transverse beams, longitudinal stiffeners and the CL-girder, the thickness of lower flange for the transverse beam and, the thickness for the panel. Furthermore, the influence of the lightweight deck and loads from the deck above on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>shell,</b> <b>the</b> effects of <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> and loads from top deck on the deck, the support conditions for the CL-girder, and the influence of deck loads on the eigenmodes were also analysed. By evaluating the results obtained from FE simulation, the support conditions of the CL-girder, the thickness of the panels and the lower flange of the transverse beams were found to be the most relevant parameters affecting both the stress and the deflection distribution of the structure. The dynamic characteristics of the structure were also analysed. The FE analysis concerning buckling of the structure was present. The results enable naval architects and structural engineers to design new extreme lightweight deck structure more reliable and economical. And some suggestions for future research are also given...|$|R
