40|$|Abstract: The direct {{addition}} of enolizable aldehydes and R-halo thioesters to produce -hydroxy thioesters enabled by reductive soft enolization is reported.

Moreover, excellent diastereoselectivity results when a chiral nonracemic R-hydroxy aldehyde derivative is used. The development of a generally applicable direct aldol addition 1 in which a carboxylate derivative and enolizable aldehyde are combined {{in the presence of a}} base (etc.) has been a long-standing yet unrealized goal in the field of organic synthesis. Unfortunately, side reactions between, for example, the base and electrophile complicate this transformation. Introduced in 1951, 2 prior enolate formation 3 (cf.

40|$|Variations in the intein-mediated protein {{splicing}} mechanism {{are becoming}} more apparent as polymorphisms in conserved catalytic residues are identified. The conserved Ser or Cys at the intein N-terminus and the conserved intein penultimate His are absent in the KlbA family of inteins. These inteins were predicted to be inactive, since an N-terminal Ala cannot perform the initial reaction of the standard protein splicing pathway to yield the requisite N-terminal splice junction (<b>thio)</b> <b>ester.</b> Despite {{the presence of an}} N-terminal Ala and a penultimate Ser, the KlbA inteins splice efficiently using an alternative protein splicing mechanism. In this non-canonical pathway, the C-extein nucleophile attacks a peptide bond at the N-terminal splice junction rather than a (<b>thio)</b> <b>ester</b> bond, alleviating the need to form the initial (<b>thio)</b> <b>ester</b> at the N-terminal splice junction.

For in vitro biosynthesis, 5 ′His 6 WS/DGAT comprising an N-terminal His 6 tag was purified from the soluble protein fraction of Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE 3) pLysS (pET 23 a:: 5 ′His 6 atf). By employing SP-Sepharose high-pressure and Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid fast-protein liquid chromatographies, a 19 -fold enrichment with a final specific activity of 165. 2 nmol mg of protein− 1 min− 1 was achieved by using 1 -hexadecanol and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates. Incubation of purified 5 ′His 6 WS/DGAT with 1 -hexadecanethiol and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates resulted in the formation of palmitic acid hexadecyl <b>thio</b> <b>ester</b> (10. 4 % relative specific activity of a 1 -hexadecanol control).

However the heavier metal chalcogenides, though known for many years, have been ignored for a long time. In this thesis {{the results of the}} development of tetraethylammonium tetraselenotungstate [EttN] 2 Wse 4 1 as a new class of selenium transfer reagent have been described. The thesis also deals with the chemistry of benzyltriethylammonium tetrathiomolybdate, [BnEt 3 N] 2 MoS 4, 2 in the synthesis of diselenides and <b>thio</b> <b>esters.</b> The thesis entitled "Chemistry of Thio and Seleno Metallates in Organic Synthesis" is divided into four Chapters. Chapter 1 In this chapter a detailed studies of alkylation of tetraethylammonium tetraselenotungstate (EuN) 2 WSe 4, 1 with a variety of alkyl halides, benzylic halides and acyl halides to yield the corresponding diselenides in excellent yields are described. (structural Formula) Scheme 1 Various carbohydrate-derived diselenides were also prepared by treating the sugar bromides with tetraethylammonium tetraselenotungstate 1 (Scheme 2). An attempt was made to synthesize seleno lactones from co- bromo acyl halides. This reaction mainly furnished the corresponding diacyl diselenides (Scheme 3). The reaction of 1 with aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates {{led to the formation of}} corresponding diselenides or mono selenides depending on the substitution on the aromatic ring (Scheme 4).

(structural formula) Scheme 5 The association constants for the binding of silver and potassium ions with the diselena crown ethers were determined. This methodology is very useful for obtaining selenacrown ethers under very mild conditions and also without using high dilution conditions. Chapter 3 In this chapter a general methodology for the facile conversion of amides and lactams to the corresponding seleno amides and selenolactams is described. A number of amides and lactams were converted into their selenocarbonyl derivatives in excellent yield via the formation of Vilsmeier intermediates followed by treatment with tetraethylammonium tetraselenotungstate (EuN^WSe 4, 1 (Scheme. 6).

40|$|The direct {{addition}} of enolizable aldehydes and sulfonyl imines to α-halo thioesters to produce β-hydroxy/amino thioesters enabled by reductive soft enolization is reported. The transformation is operationally simple and efficient {{and has the}} unusual feature of giving high syn -selectivity, which {{is the opposite of}} that produced for the aldol addition with (<b>thio)</b> <b>esters</b> under conventional conditions. This method is tolerant to aldehydes and imines that not only contain acidic α-protons, but also towards electrophiles containing other acidic protons and base-sensitive functional groups. Moreover, excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved when a chiral non-racemic α-hydroxy aldehyde derivative is used. Using MgI 2 and Ph 3 P, this method gives a wide range of aldol and Mannich products in good yields with high syn -diastereoselectivity. The products obtained from the reductive aldol and Mannich reactions are synthetically important intermediates in both polyketide and β-lactam synthesis, respectively, and can be readily derivatized to form many carbonyl derivatives through known manipulation of the thioester moiety. Also, herein the asymmetric synthesis of (+) -mefloquine, a potent anti-malarial compound, is described. The synthesis is based on a key enantioselective Darzens reaction between a chiral α-chloro-N-amino cyclic carbamate (ACC) hydrazone and a quinoline-based aldehyde.

40|$|Two {{purified}} fractions from Clostridium thermoaceticum {{are shown}} to catalyze the following reaction: CO + CH 3 THF + CoA ATP leads to CH 3 COCoA + THF. The methyltetrahydrofolate (CH 3 THF) {{gives rise to}} the methyl group of the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and the carbon monoxide (CO) and CoA to its carboxyl <b>thio</b> <b>ester</b> group. The role of ATP is unknown. One of the protein fractions (F 2) is a methyltransferase, whereas the other fraction (F 3) contains CO dehydrogenase and a methyl acceptor which is postulated to be a corrinoid enzyme. The methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group to the methyl acceptor, and the CO is converted to a formyl derivative by the CO dehydrogenase. By a mechanism that is as yet unknown, the formyl derivative in combination with CoA and the methyl of the methyl acceptor are converted to acetyl-CoA. It is also shown that fraction F 3 catalyzes the reversible exchange of 14 C from [1 - 14 C]acetyl-CoA into 14 CO and that ATP is required, but not the methyltransferase. It is proposed that these reactions are part of the mechanism which enables certain autotrophic bacteria to grow on CO. It is postulated that CH 3 THF is synthesized from CO and tetrahydrofolate which then, as described above, is converted to acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA then serves as a precursor in other anabolic reactions. A similar autotropic pathway may occur in bacteria which grow on carbon dioxide and hydrogen...|$|R

Several recently identified inteins cannot perform this acyl rearrangement {{because they do not}} begin with Cys, Thr, or Ser. This study analyzes one of these, the mycobacteriophage Bethlehem DnaB intein, which we describe here as the prototype for a new class of inteins based on sequence comparisons, reactivity, and mechanism. These Class 3 inteins are characterized by a non-nucleophilic N-terminal residue that co-varies with a non-contiguous Trp, Cys, Thr triplet (WCT) and a Thr or Ser as the first C-extein residue. Several mechanistic differences were observed when compared with standard inteins or previously studied atypical KlbA Ala 1 inteins: (a) cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction in the absence of all standard N- and C-terminal splice junction nucleophiles, (b) activation of the N-terminal splice junction by a variant Block B motif that includes the WCT triplet Trp, (c) decay of the branched intermediate by thiols or Cys despite an ester linkage at the C-extein branch point, and (d) an absolute requirement for the WCT triplet Block F Cys.

40|$|Three {{methodology}} {{studies and}} two total synthesis endeavors are presented. First, {{a study of}} Lewis acid and hydrogen bond mediated soft enolization of thioesters and their addition to imines in the Mannich reaction is reported. MgBr 2 *OEt 2 and Hunig's base are used in concert with bulky thioesters and aromatic aldehydes to generate syn-b-aminothioesters with moderate diastereoselectivity and yield. Next, a biomimetic organocatalytic Mannich reaction is presented using a chiral cinchona alkaloid to effect the enantioselective addition of an imines to thioesters with high yield and diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivities up to 88 : 12. The direct addition of enolizable aldehydes to a-iodo thioesters to produce b-hydroxy thioesters enabled by reductive soft enolization is reported.

This method is tolerant to aldehydes and imines that contain acidic a-protons, as well as electrophiles containing other acidic protons and base-sensitive functional groups. The development of a strategy for the asymmetric synthesis of {{a large portion of the}} polycyclic polyprenylated acyl phloroglucinols via N-amino cyclic carbamate hydrazones, and its application to the first asymmetric total synthesis of both (+) - and (-) -clusianone is discussed.

40|$|Mammalian ACSF 4 -U 26 (Acyl-CoA Synthetase Family Member 4), {{a protein}} of unknown function, {{comprises}} a putative adenylation-domain (AMP-binding domain) {{similar to those}} of bacterial non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, a putative phosphopantetheine attachment site and a C-terminal PQQDH (pyrroloquinoline quinone dehydrogenase) -related domain. Orthologues comprising these three domains are present in many eukaryotes including plants. Remarkably, the adenylation domain of plant ACSF 4 -U 26 shares more identity with Ebony, the insect enzyme that ligates β-alanine to several amines, than with vertebrate or insect ACSF 4 -U 26 and prediction of its specificity suggests that it also serves to activate β-alanine. In the presence of ATP, purified mouse recombinant ACSF 4 -U 26 progressively formed a covalent bond with radiolabelled β-alanine. The bond was alkali labile, suggesting a (<b>thio)</b> <b>ester,</b> and was not formed in a point-mutant devoid of the phosphopantetheine attachment site. Competition experiments with various amino acids indicated that the reaction was nearly specific for β-alanine, for which a KM of ≈ 5 µM was computed. The loaded enzyme was used to study the formation of a potential end-product. Among the twenty standard amino acids, only cysteine was able to cause unloading of the enzyme. This effect was mimicked by cysteamine and by dithiothreitol, and was unaffected by the absence of the PQQDH-related domain, suggesting that the β-alanine transfer onto thiols is catalyzed by the ACSF 4 -U 26 adenylation domain, but is physiologically irrelevant. We conclude that ACSF 4 -U 26 is a β-alanine activating enzyme, and hypothesize that it is involved in a rare intracellular reaction, possibly an infrequent post-translational or post-transcriptional modification.

Finally, the fully cured thermosets resulting front the reaction of dicyanate of bisphenol A with different admixtures of dimercaptodiphenyl sulfide were characterized by cone calorimetry to get information about flame retardancy.

40|$|In recent years, a {{group of}} {{antibacterial}} proteins produced by gram-positive bacteria have attracted great interest in their potential use as food preservatives and as antibacterial agents to combat certain infections due to gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. They are ribosomally synthesized peptides of 30 to less than 60 amino acids, with a narrow to wide antibacterial spectrum against gram-positive bacteria; the antibacterial property is heat stable, and a producer strain displays a degree of specific self-protection against its own antibacterial peptide. In many respects, these proteins are {{quite different from the}} colicins and other bacteriocins produced by gram-negative bacteria, yet customarily they also are grouped as bacteriocins. Although a large number of these bacteriocins (or bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances) have been reported, only a few have been studied in detail for their mode of action, amino acid sequence, genetic characteristics, and biosynthesis mechanisms. Nevertheless, in general, they appear to be translated as inactive prepeptides containing an N-terminal leader sequence and a C-terminal propeptide component. During posttranslational modifications, the leader peptide is removed. In addition, depending on the particular type, some amino acids in the propeptide components may undergo either dehydration and thioether ring formation to produce lanthionine and beta-methyl lanthionine (as in lantibiotics) or <b>thio</b> <b>ester</b> ring formation to form cystine (as in thiolbiotics). Some of these steps, as well as the translocation of the molecules through the cytoplasmic membrane and producer self-protection against the homologous bacteriocin, are mediated through specific proteins (enzymes). Limited genetic {{studies have shown that the}} structural gene for such a bacteriocin and the genes encoding proteins associated with immunity, translocation, and processing are present in a cluster in either a plasmid, the chromosome, or a transposon. Following posttranslational modification and depending on the pH, the molecules may either be released into the environment or remain bound to the cell wall. The antibacterial action against a sensitive cell of a gram-positive strain is produced principally by destabilization of membrane functions. Under certain conditions, gram-negative bacterial cells can also be sensitive to some of these molecules. By application of site-specific mutagenesis, bacteriocin variants which may differ in their antimicrobial spectrum and physicochemical characteristics can be produced. Research activity in this field has grown remarkably but sometimes with an undisciplined regard for conformity in the definition, naming, and categorization of these molecules and their genetic effectors.
