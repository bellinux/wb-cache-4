5|$|The murders {{received}} {{a large amount}} of media attention, both nationally and internationally. The press often compared the murders to those committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and attacked seven others (mostly prostitutes) between 1975 and 1981. There was some concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of media coverage at the time could jeopardise a trial. The murders also sparked debates in the media over the laws surrounding prostitution.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11 is a sunlike {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Cygnus that has a mass of 0.95 (± 0.1) Msun and a radius of 1.1 (± 0.1) Rsun. In other words, Kepler-11 is approximately 5% less massive and 10% wider than the Sun. The star's metallicity is 0 (± 0.1), meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of iron (and, presumably, other elements) in the star is almost {{the same as that}} of the Sun. Metallicity plays an important role in planetary systems, and stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets detected around them. This may be because the higher metallicity provides more material with which to quickly build planets into gas giants or because the higher metallicity increases planet migration towards the host star, making the planet easier to detect. The star has five other known planets in orbit: Kepler-11c, Kepler-11d, Kepler-11e, Kepler-11f, and Kepler-11g. The first five planets in the system are all able to fit within the orbit of planet Mercury, while Kepler-11g orbits further out.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E

In an initial report in June 1991, WMATA determined that ash posed no environmental risk, although there were concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of pollutants would prevent any excavated material from being accepted by landfills in D.C., Maryland, or Virginia.

5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and omission of important features.

Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players.|$|E
5|$|The {{area of the}} Theban hills {{is subject}} to {{infrequent}} violent thunder storms, causing flash floods in the valley. Recent {{studies have shown that}} there are at least seven active flood stream beds leading down into the central area of the valley. This central area appears to have been flooded {{at the end of the}} Eighteenth Dynasty, with several tombs buried under metres of debris. The tombs KV63, KV62, and KV55 are dug into the actual wadi bedrock rather than the debris, showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the valley was five meters below its present level. After this event later dynasties leveled the floor of the valley, making the floods deposit their load further down the valley, and the buried tombs were forgotten and only discovered in the early 20th century. This was the area that was the subject of the Amarna Royal Tombs Project ground scanning radar investigation, which showed several anomalies, one of which was proved to be KV63.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E

5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
