25|$|Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {{analysis}} involves {{creating an}} inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives {{a clear picture of}} the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).|$|E

According to Rock, Ulrich was the only band member who felt, even before recording, that [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] was the ideal song to be the first single. Ulrich has said that there was a [...] "big argument"; however, after explaining his point of view {{to the rest of the}} band, [...] "Enter Sandman" [...] eventually became the opening track and first single of the album.|$|E

500|$|Within the South-West Indian Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere between Africa and 90°E, a {{tropical}} or subtropical disturbance is named {{when it is}} judged to have intensified into {{a tropical}} storm with winds of at least [...] This is defined as being when gales are either observed or estimated to be present near {{a significant portion of}} the system's center. Systems are named in conjunction with Météo-France Reunion by either Météo Madagascar or the Mauritius Meteorological Service. If a disturbance reaches the naming stage between Africa and 55°E, then Météo Madagascar names it; if it reaches the naming stage between 55°E and 90°E, then the Mauritius Meteorological Service names it. The names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed. The names <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be used during a season are selected in advance by the World Meteorological Organization's RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee from names submitted by member countries.|$|E
500|$|Work at {{the pump}} {{stations}} and marine terminal, which had not stopped during the winter, continued throughout the 1976 construction season. Pump Station 6, {{just south of the}} Yukon River, had to be redesigned after excavation revealed ice-rich permafrost below the site. Five pump stations needed at startup (when throughput was lower) received their pumps, turbines, and piping. As they were completed, the pump stations received hydrostatic testing, in which portions of pipe were filled with water and subjected to pressures in excess of the eventual operating conditions. Following this testing, the initial five pump stations were disconnected from the main pipeline and had oil run through them on a continuous loop. [...] "It's very similar to your new automobile," [...] one worker said. [...] "You drive it around for ten days so that any components <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fail are given time to fail." [...] Work on additional pump stations, which would not be needed until the pipeline was brought to full capacity, was not pressed forward.|$|E
500|$|The first {{rehearsal}} in March 1942 {{was intended}} to be three hours long, but had to be stopped after 15 minutes because the 30 musicians present were too weak to play their instruments. They frequently collapsed during rehearsals, especially those playing brass instruments. Eliasberg himself had to be dragged to rehearsals on a sledge, and was eventually moved by Communist officials to an apartment nearby and given a bicycle for transport. His first attempts at conducting were like a [...] "wounded bird with wings <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drop at any moment". A report by Babushkin noted that [...] "the first violin is dying, the drum died on his way to work, the French horn is at death's door...". Orchestral players were given additional rations (donated by civilian music enthusiasts) in an effort to combat starvation, and hot bricks were used to radiate heat; nevertheless, three performers died during rehearsals. Posters went up around the city requesting all musicians to report to the Radio Committee for incorporation into the orchestra. Performers were also recalled from the front or reassigned from Soviet military bands {{with the support of the}} Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, Leonid Govorov.|$|E

500|$|While rehearsing {{for their}} {{performance}} at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna. After Madonna commented that she liked the track, Spears asked her to do the song with her. RedZone then handed [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna, who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own, therefore making the song a duet. Spears, {{who has been a}} Madonna fan for years, was [...] "beyond surprised" [...] when she heard Madonna's verse. She said [...] "I just asked her to do a little thing, but she really went there. She did a lot of stuff to it." [...] Jive Records hoped [...] "Outrageous" [...] would be released as the first single from the album, but Spears pushed for [...] "Me Against the Music". After she performed the song {{for the first time at}} the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, Spears refused to answer if it was the first single from the album, but said that [...] "there are some surprises <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come up in the song that I'm really excited about." [...] On September 16, 2003, it was confirmed that [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] would be released as the first single from In the Zone.|$|E
500|$|Because of RCA's {{leniency}} in the end, the band's departure was peaceful despite complications, {{and they}} still hold respect for RCA for what the label allowed them to do. Heppner credits the label for allowing the record that RCA funded to go to some other company who would want it instead, while Watchorn acknowledges that recent economic troubles would have mandated that record labels only keep [...] "the things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sell" [...] on their rosters. Heppner noted that labels usually shelve albums permanently if they are deemed unfit for commercial sale rather than give them to the artists who recorded them, and that the band were [...] "really, really lucky" [...] in comparison. Priestess found and signed with New York City independent record label Tee Pee Records to replace RCA in late 2009; Tee Pee Records had offered to sign the group years earlier, but the band chose RCA over Tee Pee. They enjoy being signed to Tee Pee Records rather than RCA, where they feel more [...] "at home". The band have stated that they feel less pressure to succeed on Tee Pee Records, {{and they do not}} feel any less important to the label compared to its higher-profile artists, such as American Idol contestants. [...] "Tee Pee is the perfect label for us right now, because they totally understand what we want to do," [...] Heppner stated. [...] "I am alas [...] stoked to be labelmates with so many wicked bands." [...] He additionally noted that the only advantage the band had when signed to RCA was more money, and that having a different kind of music meant that Priestess were not as lucrative as a band such as the Foo Fighters, who were more heavily promoted.|$|E
