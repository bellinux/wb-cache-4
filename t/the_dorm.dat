5|$|Roofers {{replaced}} Davison's roof in 1960 and {{new windows}} were installed in 1980. A new staircase {{on the side}} of <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> facing away from the quad was built in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>dorm</b> underwent a major renovation during the 2008–2009 school year, reopening {{at the beginning of the}} 2009–2010 academic year. The renovation included plans for upgraded accessibility, including an elevator and disabled-accessible bathrooms and doors, making it Vassar's first dorm to offer those features.|$|E
5|$|During {{the full}} moon of April 9, while Ikutsuki, Mitsuru and Yukari are observing Makoto during the midnight phenomenon, Akihiko Sanada (Hikaru Midorikawa) rushes back to <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> just as it comes under the attack of a swarm of monstrous creatures. Yukari {{immediately}} grabs Makoto and flees to the roof. However they are cornered by a giant creature who knocks Yukari out. Much to everyone's amazement though, Makoto awakens {{to the power of}} Persona, calling forth Orpheus. However another Persona known as Thanatos, rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints.|$|E
5|$|No {{childhood}} home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used {{during his time}} with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> room that Poe {{is believed to have}} used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the Raven Society.|$|E

Residents of Davison, which houses students of all grades, may live in either single rooms, one-room doubles, or three-room triples with bathrooms being shared by all members of a hall. <b>The</b> <b>dorm</b> has a kitchen, a parlor abutting the quad, and, as of 2011, its basement was a frequent practice space for student bands. In a 2005 guide to the school published by College Prowler, Davison was {{named one of the}} three best dorms at Vassar, along with Main and Jewett.|$|E
5|$|Lathrop House was {{the third}} {{residential}} quadrangle (quad) dormitory built {{on the campus of}} Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897; Lathrop followed in 1901, and Davison House's erection completed the quad in 1902. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> was paid for with Vassar's funds, unlike Strong House which had been paid for by a gift from John D. Rockefeller.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, two girls fall victim to the Apathy Syndrome {{in front of the}} school which prompts {{widespread}} rumors. Yukari, Junpei and Makoto go looking for answers from the delinquents behind Port Island Station and learn from Shinjiro Aragaki (Kazuya Nakai) that the girls had been bullying Fuka before the latter suddenly disappeared that same night. On June 8, Natsuki confesses to Mitsuru that she and her friends had locked Fuka inside the school's gymnasium. However when her friends went to check on Fuka that same night, she had mysteriously vanished while the latter developed the Apathy cases after being preyed on by Shadows. That night the SEES members deduce that Fuka may be trapped inside the Tartarus tower and plan to rescue her. However when Mitsuru asks Makoto to accompany them, Yukari grows frustrated at his ambivalence and he excludes himself from the mission. Instead, Mitsuru elects him to protect Natsuki at <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> where he listens to Natsuki's reasoning for bullying Fuka and relates that Fuka genuinely considers her as a friend.|$|E

5|$|This simple {{philosophy}} was tested as Texas A transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition {{of women to}} the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) {{were included in the}} photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females at one end of <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Persona 3. He {{moves into the}} Iwatodai dorm, {{learning}} {{of his ability to}} summon the Personas Orpheus and Thanatos of The Death Arcana when <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> is attacked by Shadows during the Dark Hour. Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in that he has the Wild Card ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of the Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. He is also the only character with access to the Velvet Room, in which the player is able to fuse together multiple Personas together to create a new and more powerful one. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. Social Links with characters in-game are represented by one of the Major Arcana and grants various bonuses during Persona fusion, increasing the player's proficiency in battle.|$|E

25|$|Davison, one of Vassar's nine {{residence}} houses, was renovated {{during the}} 2008–2009 school year. <b>The</b> <b>dorm</b> went offline {{for that year}} and its residents were absorbed into the college's remaining residence houses. This is the second dorm to be renovated {{as part of the}} school's master plan to renovate all dorms, following Jewett a few years earlier. Lathrop was scheduled to be closed and renovated during the 2010–2011 school year, but complete renovation was cancelled due to the economic downturn, with a number of improvements phased-in instead. Improvements were also made to Josselyn in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} KTRU began in February 1967 in a {{residential}} college at Rice, Hanszen College, where several students broadcast music in the Old Section part of <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> using an unlicensed 2 watt AM station, using the call sign KHCR (Hanszen College radio) and the wiring of a buzzer system. The next fall, the station transformed into an AM carrier current station with wires running through the steam tunnel system connecting the dormitories to a studio located {{in the basement of}} the Rice Memorial Center using the call sign KOWL, a nod to the Rice University mascot.|$|E

25|$|One of Lloyd's {{crowning}} achievements {{during her}} years at Michigan was {{the development of}} women's dormitories. Two major residence halls were built under her watchful eye; Stockwell and Mosher—Jordan. She also was beneficial in the planning of <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> that would eventually bear her name. Supportive programs for the female students were very important to her as well. The Women's Athletic Building {{was just one of}} the many programs that advanced the quality of life for these undergraduate women due to her efforts. Most notably, was her dedication to the Michigan League, which was newly completed when she began her term as Dean. It proved to be a headquarters for activities of women students as well as for alumnae.|$|E

Although not specifically labelled as a PE tradition, Flag Football {{is one of the top}} interhall sports that Pyros participate in every year. Since 2013, <b>the</b> <b>dorm's</b> flag football team (known as PEFFB) has been coached by Notre Dame football players, including DaVaris Daniels and Malik Zaire. In 2015, PEFFB was coached by Zaire as well as his teammates Sheldon Day and Cole Luke.

Ducky's place in <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> is taken by Billy Kramer, a Smallville boy whom Clark befriends and decides to trust with his secret. Much as Superman would later do for Jimmy Olsen, Superboy gives Billy a supersonic whistle that he can use to call Superboy for help when needed. While he is befriending Billy, Clark becomes romantically involved with a wheelchair-using student named Lori Lemaris. He eventually proposes to her, but Lori reveals she already learned his identity telepathically. She rejects his proposal {{because she is a}} mermaid from Atlantis.|$|E
25|$|The first {{undergraduate}} {{classes on}} the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. (Glenn T. Seaborg was a member.) Also in 1929, the Bruin and Trojan football teams {{met for the first}} time, with the Bruins losing 76-0. The first building dedicated to housing was built in the early 1930s. Titled Hershey Hall, the building was named after Almira Hershey who willed $300,000 to UCLA to have <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> built. The emergence of the Great Depression slowed down but did not halt UCLA's development. A Southern section of the UC faculty Academic Senate was voted on in 1931 and organized in 1932. In 1933, after intense lobbying by alumni, faculty, administration and community leaders, UCLA was permitted to award the Master's degree, and in 1936, the doctorate, against resistance from Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} was renewed in 2008, when {{several members of}} the graduating class stole the statue from its secure location on campus. Despite rumors that the statue was locked in the college's military bunker, one of the students had seen the statue returned to the basement of a college dormitory after the reunion festivities of 2007. In late April 2008, the students staged a fake poker game {{in the basement of the}} dormitory; while two kept a lookout at the building's entrances, a third picked the lock to the basement storage room, and a fourth student backed a getaway car up to the dorm's loading dock. The heist was completed in under 20 minutes, and the statue was promptly transported to Vassar College, where it was left in <b>the</b> <b>dorm</b> room of a student's girlfriend.|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} studying {{energy consumption}} in <b>the</b> <b>dorms.</b> A typical dorm room has two televisions, one refrigerator, two computers, and lighting.
