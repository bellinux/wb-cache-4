5|$|As ununennium is {{the lightest}} undiscovered element, {{it has been}} the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> {{synthesis}} experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years. The Russian experiments were conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a <b>target</b> <b>of</b> berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Based on the theoretically predicted cross-section, it was expected that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} examines whether confronting prejudice for {{the greater}} good - confronting in a way that conveys the benefits of prejudice reduction to groups and institutions other than the <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice - can help <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice be taken more seriously by members of the perpetrating group. This dissertation first tested whether <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice are taken less seriously when they confront than members of the perpetrating group (i. e. allies). Two studies demonstrate that members of the perpetrating group (i. e., men, Whites) take confrontations by <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice (i. e., women, Blacks) less seriously than confrontations by allies and that these reactions may be explained by a tendency to attribute targets' confrontations to internal causes (i. e., tendencies to overreact). This dissertation next tested whether confronting {{for the greater}} good helps <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice to be taken more seriously when confronting. Four follow-up studies suggested that <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice were taken just as seriously as allies when confronting {{for the greater good}}. However, these latter experiments failed to replicate the effect that <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice who confront without using the greater good strategy are taken less seriously than allies who engage in the same confrontation. However, a meta-analysis of all studies demonstrated, across studies, confrontations by <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice were taken less seriously than confrontations by allies, while confrontations for the greater good were taken equally seriously for <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice and allies. As such, the individual studies in this dissertation may have failed to demonstrate the predicted effects {{due to a lack of}} power. This dissertation thus suggests that confronting for the greater good is one strategy that might help <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice to be taken seriously when they confront, although further research is needed to better understand the boundary conditions of this effect and should explore other strategies prejudice confronters might also use to be taken more seriously...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} of peroxisome formation and proliferation {{are still a}} matter of debate. We have previously shown that peroxisomes share some components of their division machinery with mitochondria. hFis 1, a tail-anchored membrane protein, regulates the membrane fission of both organelles by DLP 1 /Drp 1 recruitment, but nothing {{is known about the}} mechanisms <b>of</b> the dual <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> hFis 1. Here we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} peroxisomal <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> hFis 1 depends on Pex 19 p, a peroxisomal membrane protein import factor. hFis 1 /Pex 19 p binding was demonstrated by expression and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Using mutated versions of hFis 1 an essential binding region for Pex 19 p was located within the last 26 C-terminal amino acids of hFis 1, which are required for proper targeting to both mitochondria and peroxisomes. The basic amino acids in the very C terminus are not essential for Pex 19 p binding and peroxisomal targeting, but are instead required for mitochondrial <b>targeting.</b> Silencing <b>of</b> Pex 19 p by small interference RNA reduced the <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> hFis 1 to peroxisomes, but not to mitochondria. In contrast, overexpression of Pex 19 p alone was not sufficient to shift the <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> hFis 1 to peroxisomes. Our findings indicate that <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> hFis 1 to peroxisomes and mitochondria are independent events and support a direct, Pex 19 p-dependent <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> peroxisomal tail-anchored proteins...|$|R
