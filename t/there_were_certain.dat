5|$|The {{majority}} of food riots had ended by 1801, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> political undertones to the actions, though {{lack of leadership}} meant that little came of it. By the 1870s, 60% of Wales was owned by 570 families, most of whom did no farming. Instead, they employed workers, who were forced to vote Tory or lose their jobs.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Escondido {{proved to}} be a rich {{collecting}} ground, and after nine days in the Gulf, they had to scale back their collecting ambitions owing to lack of space for the specimens. It had already become clear that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> species that were ubiquitous in the region: some species of crabs, sea anemones, limpets, barnacles and sea cucumbers were found at every stop, and the sun star, Heliaster kubiniji, the sea urchin, Arbacia incisa, and bristleworms of the Eurythoe genus were common.|$|E
5|$|Darius's European {{expedition}} was a {{major event}} in his reign, which began with the invasion of Thrace. Darius also conquered many cities of the northern Aegean, Paeonia, while Macedonia submitted voluntarily, after the demand of earth and water, becoming a vassal kingdom. He then left Megabyzus to conquer Thrace, returning to Sardis to spend the winter. The Greeks living in Asia Minor {{and some of the}} Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule already by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> Greeks who were pro-Persian, although these were largely based in Athens. To improve Greek-Persian relations, Darius opened his court and treasuries to those Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, the increasing concerns amongst the Greeks over the strength of Darius's kingdom along with the constant interference by the Greeks in Ionia and Lydia were stepping stones towards the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and certain of the leading Greek city states.|$|E

5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body, but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|The Cuu Long {{conference held}} between 6 and 10 October {{was the first}} provincial-level conference to be held. By 22 October, 21 provinces had held provincial-level party conferences. The central party {{leadership}} faced less criticism on the draft Political Report and socio-economic policies from the provincial-level conferences than by district-level conferences. The provincial-level conferences criticized central policies less and were evasive about critical issues. However, the provincial-level conferences were not completely dormant and scored some minor victories, such as reducing the average age needed to join an executive committee and they adopted a more flexible and efficient mode of planning and organization. As during the district-level conferences, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> convocations which attracted attention; the An Giang Party Committee criticized past economic performance, while the Ha Son Binh Congress criticized the irrational management of provincial economic affairs. While these committees criticized past policies or well-known deficiencies, none of them criticized {{the policies of the}} central party leadership.|$|E

25|$|It may {{be thought}} strange that I could abstain {{from a woman}} who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> {{groups who}} took {{to it with}} great enthusiasm, other groups were {{directly}} lukewarm and other hostile, each profession reacted differently.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> warm nutrient-rich environments {{such as the}} Gulf of Mexico and {{the ancient}} Tethys Sea where the large amounts of organic {{material}} falling to the ocean floor exceeded {{the rate at which}} it could decompose. This resulted in large masses of organic material being buried under subsequent deposits such as shale formed from mud.

25|$|Since every {{household}} {{was almost}} entirely self-sufficient, {{there was very}} little need for trade.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> {{grades of}} {{immortality}}, {{so if the}} practiced alchemist died, the level of immortality they achieved was determined by their corpse.

Likewise, if their corpse disappeared, leaving behind only the clothes, such as in the death of an adept named Ko Hung, this was another form of immortality known as shih chieh hsien (corpse-free immortals) (Cooper, 14).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Dutch Republic, the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands had urban and not national citizenship. No inclusive citizenship status existed for the population of the Low Countries. Citizenship was a legal status available to all inhabitants of a particular city. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> obligation and privileges applied to all those that were burghers (citizens). These rights were never formally written down in legal documents, rather existed as a set of practices or city rights varying in every territory.|$|E

Unsurprisingly, the player backed down and signed.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 this {{college was}} renamed Victoria College; when it {{acquired}} university status on 2 April 1918 it was renamed once again, to Stellenbosch University. Initially only one university was {{planned for the}} Cape but after the government was visited by a delegation from the Victoria College, {{it was decided to}} allow the college to be a university if it could raise Â£100,000. Jannie Marais, a wealthy Stellenbosch farmer, bequeathed the money required before his death in 1915. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> conditions to his gift which included Dutch/Afrikaans having equal status to English and that the lecturers teach at least half their lectures in Dutch/Afrikaans. By 1930, very little, if any, tuition was in English.|$|E
25|$|Michelangelo {{took over}} a {{building}} site at which four piers, enormous beyond any constructed since ancient Roman times, were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica.

They all called for a dome to equal that engineered by Brunelleschi a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of Renaissance Florence, and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either Greek Cross form, like the iconic St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, or of a Latin Cross with the transepts of identical form to the chancel, as at Florence Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Man may commit certain grievous sinsaccording to {{his light}} and knowledgethat will place him {{beyond the reach}} of the atoning blood of Christ.

Joseph Smith taught that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>certain</b> sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will place the transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf.|$|E
