50|$|Tire {{forces are}} divided into three axes: radial, lateral, and {{tangential}} (or fore-aft). The radial axis runs from the tire center toward the tread, and is the vertical axis running from the roadway through the tire center toward the vehicle. This axis supports the vehicle’s weight. The lateral axis runs sideways across the tread. This axis {{is parallel to the}} <b>tire</b> <b>mounting</b> axle on the vehicle. The tangential axis is the one {{in the direction of the}} tire travel.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the {{external}} Continental <b>tire</b> <b>mounting</b> was a factory option on {{various types of}} cars during the 1950s and early 1960s. On some models [...] - [...] such as on the Nash Metropolitan, Jeepster Commando, and Mercury Turnpike Cruiser [...] - [...] the Continental tire was a standard feature. Most often, the car's rear bumper was extended and the tire had a fabric or metal cover. The bracket for the spare wheel was designed to swing away {{for access to the}} trunk.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The power {{consumption}} and load capacity of agricultural machines have grown {{and the effects}} of pressure on the soil by tires have been still little investigated. In concern with sustainable development, the relationship machine-tire-soil must be in balance to give more consistency on the best use of tires for a given load. This study aimed to evaluate four tires of two constructive types, the bias belted tires and radial tires, both with respective rim diameters of 22. 5 and 26. 5 inches with variables measuring the footprint, elastic deformation, sinkage and resistance to penetration. A hydraulic press with an attachment shaft for <b>tire</b> <b>mounting</b> and a box of soil in which the tire has been imposed on a load of 53. 00 kN using nominal pressures recommended by the tire manufacturer. The radial construction tire with rim diameter of 26. 5 inches obtained less sinkage and resistance to penetration; however, greater elastic deformation and footprint compared to other tires. The bias-belted tire with 22. 5 -inch rim presented the highest resistance to penetration and the lowest elastic deformation...|$|E

40|$|Legal {{requirements}} {{in some countries}} require vehicle manufacturers to reliably document the type, origin and manufacturing dates of the <b>tires</b> <b>mounted</b> to a vehicle. This data accompanies the vehicle and {{can be stored in}} a database in the destination country, e. g. in case a recall needs to be issued for a certain type of tire and manufacturing period. If manufacturers need to document the DOT code of <b>tires</b> <b>mounted</b> on a vehicle, it is advantageous to replace current manual labor required for this task with automatic equipment. This paper details the results of a study performed in cooperation with a major German car manufacturer to automate the process of reading the DOT code of the <b>tires</b> <b>mounted</b> on rims directly before vehicle assembly to fulfill required tracing requirements. Different approaches to reading the DOT code are discussed in the paper, including the difficulties that were encountered with various standard methods. Custom algorithms were developed, which were applied in the field study at the auto manufacturer's wheel plant. Several thousand wheels were recorded electronically along with auxiliary information like tire type, size, etc. Different algorithms were applied to the test data. Finally, the results of the tests are presented and discussed. Copyrigh...|$|R
5000|$|A Continental tire is an upright, external, <b>mounted</b> spare <b>tire</b> {{behind an}} automobile's trunk compartment. The term also {{describes}} a non-functional bulge that is stamped {{into the trunk}} lid or a cosmetic accessory {{to the rear of}} the car giving the impression of a spare <b>tire</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the enclosed trunk on automobiles meant the spare tire could be placed out of sight, but this arrangement used up valuable space for carrying luggage. Edsel Ford had a special car built after returning {{from a trip to}} Europe that would have a [...] "continental look" [...] - [...] including a spare <b>tire</b> <b>mounted</b> on the trunk. The 1939 Lincoln Continental's short trunk with its external rear spare <b>tire</b> <b>mount</b> became a distinctive design. While {{this was not the first}} car to either carry its spare above the rear bumper or integrated into the rear bodywork, it was the first to do it so elegantly and thus this feature became known as a [...] "Continental tire" [...] even if the design was found on other brands.|$|R
5000|$|The LJ was updated in May 1972 and {{renamed the}} LJ20. The grille bars were changed from {{horizontal}} to vertical for the LJ20. The engine {{was replaced with}} an updated, water-cooled unit (the L50), and its [...] enabled the LJ to reach 80 km/h (50 mph). A special version with the spare <b>tire</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the passenger seat allowed for two small rear seats, facing each other. The introduction of left hand drive signalled Suzuki's worldwide ambitions for the truck. The Hard Top (Van) was also introduced when the LJ20 arrived, equipped with smaller, 15 inch wheels. Suzuki themselves did not export them to America, a US company called IEC (International Equipment Co.) imported them. Export Jimnys had the spare <b>tire</b> <b>mounted</b> on the outside, as Kei regulations on length did not apply.|$|R

5000|$|The terms {{wheel and}} rim {{are often used}} synonymously, as in {{decorative}} wheels being called rims. Used broadly, or used figuratively, the word rim can mean {{the outer edge of}} any circular object. Some authors are careful to use rim for only the outer portion of a wheel, where the <b>tire</b> <b>mounts,</b> just as the rim of a coffee cup or a meteor crater does not refer to the entire object. One engineering text says [...] "alloy wheels are often incorrectly called aluminum rims". Others use rim to mean the entire metal part to which the <b>tire</b> <b>mounts,</b> because the rim and the wheel are often cast or stamped from a single piece of metal instead of being distinct as with wire wheels. At the same time, [...] "wheel" [...] may refer to the entire rotating assembly, including the tire.|$|R

50|$|A funitel {{consists}} {{of one or}} two loops of cable strung between two terminals over intermediate towers. In order to maximize the stability of the passenger cabins, the cables are arranged in two pairs moving in separate directions. Although it might appear that there are four cables in total, {{most of the time they}} are all connected as a single, long loop.The passenger cabins are connected to a pair of cables with four spring-loaded grips (two to each cable). Because the cable runs at a speed faster than that at which most people would care to board or disembark, the cabins must be slowed down while in the terminals to allow skiers to get on and off. This is accomplished by detaching the cabin from the cable and slowing it down with progressively slower rotating <b>tires</b> <b>mounted</b> on the ceiling of the terminal. Once the cabin has reached a speed at which it is safe to load or unload passengers, the cabin is moved about the end turnaround by <b>tires</b> <b>mounted</b> on the floor. The cabin is then accelerated to line speed with a second set of rotating tires.|$|R
