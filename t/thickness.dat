40|$|InGaN/GaN multiquantum-well (MQW) {{structures}} {{grown by}} metalorganic chemical-vapor deposition on n-type GaN and capped by p-type GaN were investigated by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, double crystal x-ray diffraction, and temperature-dependent photoluminescence. For the sample with strained-layer <b>thicknesses</b> {{greater than the}} critical <b>thicknesses,</b> a high density of pure edge type threading dislocations generated from MQW layers and extended to the cap layer was observed. These dislocations result from a relaxation of the strained layers when their <b>thicknesses</b> are beyond the critical <b>thicknesses.</b> Because of indium outdiffusion from the well layers due to the anneal effect of Mg-doped cap layer growth and defects generated from strain relaxation, the PL emission peak was almost depressed by the broad yellow band with an intensity maximum at 2. 28 eV. But for the sample with strained-layer <b>thicknesses</b> less than the critical <b>thicknesses,</b> it has no such phenomenon.

40|$|Abstract Background Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) {{is associated}} with several medical complications before and after delivery. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the concordance between the fetal ultrasonographic measurement of subcutaneous tissue <b>thicknesses</b> and the skinfold <b>thicknesses</b> assessment in intrauterine growth restricted newborns. Methods We designed an exploratory study. Fetal ultrasonographic measurement of subcutaneous tissue <b>thicknesses,</b> according to Bernstein's and Galan's method, and neonatal skinfold <b>thicknesses</b> were evaluated in 13 intrauterine growth restricted newborns within 4 hours before delivery and on the first day of life, respectively. Concordance between fetal and neonatal measurements was assessed using the Lin's correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman method. Results The data obtained by the measurements of neonatal skinfold <b>thicknesses</b> was significantly correlated with the prenatal measurements (Lin's coefficients, arm: 0. 60; subscapular: 0. 72; abdomen: 0. 51). Bland-Altman analysis showed moderate agreement between the fetal ultrasonographic measurement of subcutaneous tissue <b>thicknesses</b> and the neonatal skinfold <b>thicknesses</b> assessment. Conclusions The present study provides preliminary evidence that fetal sonographic measurements may represent additional indices of intrauterine growth restriction. </p...|$|R
