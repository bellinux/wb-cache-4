40|$|Abstract. Despite {{extensive}} {{testing of}} application functionality and security, we see many instances of software, when attacked or during normal operation, performing adversely {{in ways that}} were not anticipated.

There are many reasons for this, including <b>the</b> relative <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task, the pressure to implement quickly, and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> qualified testers.

5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof.

He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by <b>the</b> unexpected <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion.

25|$|Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog, 1955) {{was one of}} {{the first}} documentaries about the Nazi {{concentration}} camps, but it deals more with the memory of the camps than with their actual past existence. Realising that standard documentary techniques would be incapable of confronting <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horror (and even risked humanising it), Resnais chose to use a distancing technique by alternating historical black-and-white images of the camps with contemporary colour footage of the sites in long tracking shots. The accompanying narration (written by Jean Cayrol, himself a survivor of the camps) was intentionally understated to add to the distancing effect. Although the film encountered censorship problems with the French government, its impact was immense and it remains one of the director's most admired works.|$|E

However, the guilty verdict was overturned by the judge advocate general of the army on grounds that Speed {{had been at the}} parole camp all day and had never placed one single soldier on board the Sultana. Captain Williams, who had placed the men on board, was a regular army officer and graduate of West Point, so the military refused to go after one of their own. And Colonel Hatch, who had concocted a bribe with Captain Mason to crowd as many men onto the Sultana as possible, had quickly quit the service and was now a civilian, no longer accountable to a military court. In the end, no one was ever held accountable for the greatest maritime disaster in United States history.|$|E

In mid-November the nuncio sent a sorrowful summary of the facts: thirty vessels were missing, thirteen had crashed into the reefs, {{and there were many}} dead from the Portuguese upper class. Eighteen of the sunken ships were embargoed hulks, whose loss could easily be replaced but the addition of five of the King's principal ships known as the Apostles had perished, the worst loss being the 900 ton galleon Santiago, which had carried 330 soldiers as well as sailors, of whom only twenty-three survived. In addition, disease had ravaged through the ships ever since they had been at port. These could not be replaced so easily and there were few survivors in others.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{existing}} polar prediction systems do not yet meet users’ needs; and possible ways forward in advancing prediction capacity in polar regions and beyond are outlined. The polar regions have been attracting more and more attention in recent years, fuelled by <b>the</b> perceptible impacts <b>of</b> anthropogenic climate change. Polar climate change provides new opportunities, such as shorter shipping routes between Europe and East Asia, but also new risks such as the potential for industrial accidents or emergencies in ice-covered seas. Here, it {{is argued that}} environmental prediction systems for the polar regions are less developed than elsewhere. There are many reasons for this situation, including the polar regions being (historically) lower priority, with less in situ observations, and with numerous local physical processes that are less well-represented by models. By contrasting <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> different physical processes in polar and lower latitudes, the need for a dedicated polar prediction effort is illustrated. Research priorities are identified that will help to advance environmental polar prediction capabilities. Examples include an improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polar observing system; <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean models, even for short-term prediction; and insight into polar-lower latitude linkages and their role for forecasting. Given <b>the</b> <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> challenges ahead, in a harsh and remote environment such as the polar regions, {{it is argued that}} rapid progress will only be possible with a coordinated international effort.
