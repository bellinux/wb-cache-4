25|$|Most of the {{terminal}} unit equipment used for receiving RTTY signals was homebuilt, using designs published in amateur radio publications. These original designs {{can be divided into}} two classes of terminal units: audio-type and intermediate frequency converters. The audio-type converters proved to be more popular with amateur radio operators. The Twin City, W2JAV and W2PAT designs were examples of typical <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> that were used into the middle 1960s. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> designed by W6FFC, such as the TT/L-2, ST-3, ST-5, and ST-6. These designs were first published in RTTY Journal starting in September 1967 and ending in 1970.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part 97 {{to allow}} faster RTTY speeds. Four {{standard}} RTTY speeds were authorized, namely, 60 (45 baud), 67 (50 baud), 75 (56.25 baud) and 100 (75 baud) words per minute. Many Amateur Radio operators had equipment that {{was capable of}} being upgraded to 75 and 100 words per minute by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100 words per minute operation, many Amateur Radio operators moved back to 60 words per minute. Some {{of the reasons for}} the failure of 100 words per minute HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical teleprinters, narrow bandwidth <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> continued use of 170Hz shift at 100 words per minute and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} {{generation}} remote <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (often {{in the form of}} Teleprinters like a Friden Flexowriter) saw greatly increased use. [...] Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center. Eventually these stand-alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected network of networks—the Internet.|$|E

An input unit (9) inputs the data and an output unit (6) outputs the data. Data and/or application software are stored in the host computer and are processed in the host computer for operating the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit.</b> The data produced by the application software is available in a representation format for a representation by the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The input unit is a keyboard, a computer mouse, a touch pad, a touch screen, a graphic tablet, a digitizer pen, a joystick, a game pad, a microphone, a module for position determination, a camera, a scanner and/or a sensor. The output unit is a screen, a loudspeaker, a headphone, a comparable image, a sound reproduction unit and/or a transmitter.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to propose a control method with a ventilation requirement of variable air volume (VAV) system in multi-zone. In order to control the VAV system inmulti-zone, it is essential to control the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> installed in each zone. A VAV <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> with conventional control method using a fixed minimum air flow can cause indoor air quality (IAQ) issues depending on the variation in the number of occupants. This research proposes a control method with a ventilation requirement of the VAV <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> and AHU inmulti-zone. The integrated control method with an air flow increase model in the VAV <b>terminal</b> <b>unit,</b> AHU, and outdoor air intake rate increase model in the AHU was based on the indoor CO 2 concentration. The conventional and proposed control algorithms were compared through a TRNSYS simulation program. The proposed VAV <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> control method satisfies all the conditions of indoor temperature, IAQ, and stratification. An energy comparison with the conventional control method showed that the method satisfies not only the indoor thermal comfort, IAQ, and stratification issue, but also reduces the energy consumption...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{have also}} {{referred}} to several clues in the code such as a concealed reference to the word [...] "MYRTUS", believed {{to refer to the}} Myrtle tree, or Hadassah in Hebrew.

Also, the number 19790509 appears once in the code and might refer to the date [...] "1979 May 09", the day Habib Elghanian, a Persian Jew, was executed in Tehran.

40|$|Real time {{monitoring}} in designated location using remote observation {{has become}} one topic chosen to be efficiently developed {{because it can be}} observed and anticipated earlier when the water quality is decreasing. One of the indicators of water quality is salinity, which is being developed through this study by using remote measurement system (telemetry) using Wi-Fi network. To determine the change of the indicator, a salinity sensor was used to determine the level of salinity. The sensors were mounted on a Remote <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> (RTU) attach on the object being observed. Those sensors produced analog signal so the signal should be converted into digital signal using Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) on ATSAM 3 X 8 E microcontroller. The digital data were then sent using serial communication from microcontroller to computer. The data were saved in the database and sent to Control <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> (CTU) using Wi-Fi network. A characterization was then conducted to a series of sensors produced from the previous phase using standard equipment to ADC value and a formula of sensor characteristic to ADC value was calculated which results in salinity equation value on y = 0, 049 x – 35, 306. The formula was then used in microcontroller program which results in coefficient of correlation on salinity sensor as R = 0, 993 with 0, 025 ppt error. From the test on communication system between database in Remote <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> (RTU) and Control <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> (CTU), there is no additional and missing data from data sent and data received, so it can be concluded that there is no error...|$|R
