40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{determine}} the cost benefit of targeted <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour compound removal through the Goulburn Valley Water Euroa Water Treatment Plant (WTP). Volunteer Goulburn Valley Water Staff will be utilised to determine the effectiveness of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour compound removal through optimisation of the existing treatment process and alternative coagulation chemicals. It is hypothesised that elevated organics and/or the presence of algal metabolites within the raw water reservoirs are the key causes of poor <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour perceptions within the Euroa Community. The key research questions regarding this project are: &middot; Does targeting optimisation of the water treatment plant for a specific <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour causing compound lead to a perceived improvement in <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour? &middot; Are any notable improvements in <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour proportional to the financial outlay for targeting the removal of specific <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour causing compounds? &middot; Are the associated benefits of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour compound removal proportional to the financial outlay?

40|$|The {{functional}} {{architecture of the}} central <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> olfactory systems in primates provides evidence that the convergence of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell information onto single neurons is realized in the caudal orbitofrontal cortex (and immediately adjacent agranular insula). These higher-order association cortical areas thus support ¯avour processing. Much less is known, however, about homologous regions in the human cortex, or how taste±odour interactions, and thus ¯avour perception, are implemented in the human brain. We performed an event-related fMRI study to investigate where in the human brain these interactions between <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour stimuli (administered retronasally) may be realized. The brain regions that were activated by both <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell included parts of the caudal orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insular cortex and adjoining areas, and anterior cingulate cortex. It was shown that {{a small part of}} the anterior (putatively agranular) insula responds to unimodal <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> to unimodal olfactory stimuli, and that a part of the anterior frontal operculum is a unimodal taste area (putatively primary taste cortex) not activated by olfactory stimuli. Activations to combined olfactory <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> stimuli where there was little or no activation to either alone (providing positive evidence for interactions between the olfactory <b>and</b> <b>taste</b> inputs) were found in a lateral anterior part of the orbitofrontal cortex.

40|$|Patients {{with cancer}} often {{experience}} changes in <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell perception during chemotherapy. The {{aim of this}} dissertation was to investigate <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell changes and short- and long-term effects of chemotherapy in a homogeneous population of testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Moreover, metallic taste experienced by patients treated for cancer was explored. The <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell function, food preference, dietary intake, and body composition were investigated in testicular cancer patients before, during and after chemotherapy. These parameters were also explored in testicular cancer survivors 1 - 7 years post-chemotherapy. Over time, <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell function was highly variable within and between patients. A transient decrease of subjective <b>taste,</b> appetite, <b>and</b> hunger feelings was observed per chemotherapy cycle. The percentage of fat mass of patients increased during chemotherapy. The bone density decreased. The survivors had a higher body mass index, and more (abdominal) fat than healthy controls. Testosterone level was an important determinant of body composition. The survivors had a lower total <b>taste</b> function <b>and</b> a higher bitter taste threshold. Results indicate that given the heterogeneity of <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell changes, dietary advice on an individual base is needed. Additionally, intervention strategies aimed to limit the impact of cardiovascular risk factors should start early, since the body composition of patients already changes during chemotherapy. Literature review showed that the prevalence of metallic taste ranges from 10 % to 78 % among patients treated with chemotherapy. Subsequent research demonstrated that also patients treated with concomitant radiotherapy and targeted therapy experienced metallic <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> {{that it was not}} characteristic for chemotherapy...|$|R

5|$|In particular, after 1849, Wagner resented Meyerbeer's {{continuing}} {{success at}} a time when his own vision of German opera had little chance of prospering. After the May Uprising in Dresden of 1849, Wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to Saxony. During his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of Le prophète sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer's wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay 'Jewishness in Music'. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of German music by alleged Jewish venality and willingness to cater to the lowest <b>tastes,</b> <b>and</b> attributed the supposed poor quality of such 'Jewish music' to Jewish speech and song patterns, which 'though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him'.|$|E

40|$|Malnutrition {{is common}} in both adult and {{pediatric}} patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Patients commonly attribute difficulties maintaining food intake to an altered taste developed during treatment. This review summarizes {{what is known about}} <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell dysfunction in patients with undergoing chemotherapy as their main treatment modality. Self-reported <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell alterations are prevalent in upwards of 86 % of cancer patients. There is some evidence for decreased taste sensitivity in cancer patients when assessed using common gustatory tests. In some patients, <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell alterations may continue well after their cancer treatment has been completed. Such disorders can increase distress, reduce appetite and contribute towards poor nutritional status in cancer patients. There remain no effective interventions for improving the appetite or nutritional intake of patients with cancer experiencing <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell changes. There is a lack of consistency in assessment methodologies for measuring <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell changes in cancer patients and we therefore recommend that future work use well-established methods. Research should also take into account the role of food hedonics, food flavor and texture in assessing the association between taste dysfunction, poor oral intake and malnutrition in cancer patients. Both adult and child cancer patients should be counselled on the potential impact <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell dysfunction can have on their appetite and oral intake...|$|R
