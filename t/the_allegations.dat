5|$|Less {{than three}} weeks before the primary, Comer's former girlfriend told the Courier-Journal in a letter that Comer had abused her {{physically}} and mentally in 1991 and that he had accompanied her to an abortion clinic. Other newspapers, including the Lexington Herald-Leader, which citied the Courier-Journal, then reported <b>the</b> <b>allegations.</b> The Lexington Herald-Leader had reported earlier that the Lexington-area blogger who had been publishing stories about <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> for months had been in contact with the husband of Heiner's running mate, K. C. Crosbie.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> had not {{previously}} been reported to authorities, the reasons given included fear of disbelief and distrust in the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked by police, with Savile as the same alleged perpetrator. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that <b>the</b> <b>allegations</b> made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009 could have resulted in prosecutions being undertaken.|$|E

5000|$|If the Defendant {{was aware}} of only two {{complaints}} that the Plaintiff had made to his wife, which related to a dog otherwise unconnected with the lawsuit, the Defendant would be very unwise to admit <b>the</b> <b>allegation.</b> Similarly, to either [...] "not admit" [...] or deny <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> would invite a finding against himself on that point, and may lead to an award of costs. Accordingly, the Defendant could reasonably ask for <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> to be better particularised so that he may plead to it properly.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>allegations</b> {{were first}} sparked by University of Ottawa law {{professor}} Amir Attaran, {{who claimed that}} full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. <b>The</b> <b>allegations</b> have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 83 {{experienced}} audit committee members {{participated in an}} experiment in which they evaluated the credibility of and allocated investigative resources towards a whistle-blowing allegation of financial reporting malfeasance by corporate executive officers. We manipulated whether <b>the</b> whistle‐blowing <b>allegation</b> was made through anonymous or non‐anonymous channels and whether <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> posed a relatively high or low threat to the personal reputation of the audit committee member who was charged with investigating <b>the</b> <b>allegation.</b> Results indicate that the participating audit committee members attributed lower credibility and allocated fewer investigatory resources when the whistle‐blowing report was received through an anonymous versus non‐anonymous channel, and when <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> posed a relatively high versus low level of reputation threat. While the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 requires audit committees of publicly traded firms to provide an anonymous whistle‐blowing channel to employees, our findings suggest disturbing unintended consequences of such regulation; specifically, audit committee members might fail to sufficiently investigate whistle‐blowing allegations received through anonymous whistle‐blowing channels, particularly if <b>the</b> <b>allegation</b> poses a personal reputation threat. ...|$|R
