5000|$|Portfolio {{investments}} typically involve <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{that are}} highly liquid, i.e. they can be bought and sold very quickly. A portfolio investment is an investment made by an investor who {{is not involved in}} the management of a company. This is in contrast to direct investment, which allows an investor to exercise a certain degree of managerial control over a company. Equity investments where the owner holds less than 10% of a company's shares are classified as portfolio investment.

As such it is a tool for understanding the unique legal environment of Central and Eastern Europe by way of casting a closer glance at legal and business problems connected to enforcement of contracts. The book covers not just issues of procedural nature like measures aimed at improving the efficiency of court enforcement and the work of bailiffs, the recently discovered provisional and preliminary measures, or enforcement of foreign judgments and arbitral awards; but also such other issues as the fate of newcomer contracts (franchise, leasing, various secured and <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities)</b> or the inherited penalty clauses in the region...|$|E

It begins by reviewing the current case law, analyzing the approaches that courts have used in applying Morrison and highlighting certain weaknesses in the transaction-based test adopted in that case. It then investigates two potential paths for foreign investors: litigation brought in U.

40|$|The authors assess empirically {{the impact}} of {{contractual}} savings institutions portfolios (pension funds and life insurance companies) on securities markets, for example, depth and liquidity in the domestic stock market, and depth in the domestic bond market. They discuss how the institutionalization of savings can modify financial markets through the lengthening of securities'maturities. The results are the following: 1) An increase in assets of contractual savings institutions relative to domestic financial assets has {{a positive impact on}} the depth of stock and bond markets on average. 2) The impact on stock market depth and liquidity is nonlinear: it is stronger in countries where corporate information is more transparent. 3) There is evidence of a significant heterogeneity among countries: contractual savings have a stronger impact on securities markets in countries where the financial system is market based, pension fund contributions are mandatory, and international <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> are lower. 4) The authors do not find that {{the impact of}} contractual savings institutions on securities markets is explained by the overall level of development, education, demographic structure or the legal environment.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the modern system of securities holding through intermediaries poses particularly difficult conflict of laws issues. The traditional approach to conflict of laws suggests that the law governing a <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{is determined by the}} location of the securities; yet under modern conditions it is difficult in practice, if not impossible in theory, to determine that location. A recent project of the Hague Conference on Private International Law has confronted these problems and devised a workable, modern approach. For any such project to succeed, lawyers must be willing to abandon traditional concepts of conflict of laws such as “lex situs” or “party autonomy. ” Rather, lawyers must be willing to adopt an approach to conflict of laws that is responsive to the needs and realities of the modern system of securities holding through intermediaries. This Article explores some of the basic problems that must be confronted in that effort...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} legal {{jurisdiction}} {{is considered an}} integral part of sovereignty and one in which States naturally assume responsibility to adjudicate on matters and persons within their territorial boundaries. Except by mutual consent, no State is allowed to undermine the sovereign authority of another by enacting and applying its laws to matters and persons within the jurisdiction of that other State except in circumstances permitted under conflict of law principles. However, global expansion of commerce, flourishing of multinational corporations, and technological revolution, has not only increased international <b>transaction</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities,</b> but also market abuses, fraud and manipulative conduct associated with domestic securities markets have spread across borders. So, instead of jurisdiction based on conventional principles, a State justify extraterritorial application of its national securities regulation if the abusive, fraudulent or manipulative conduct of foreign persons imposes negative externalities on the State, its economy, and investors.

40|$|Securities have {{replaced}} bank lending {{in recent years}} as the primary means through which funds are invested internationally, and in the process, the share of U. S. securities owned by foreigners has grown markedly. Between 1974 and 2002, the proportion of the value of outstanding U. S. long-term securities (equities and long-term debt) that was foreign-owned increased from about 5 percent to about 12 percent. At the same time, U. S. holdings of foreign long-term securities also increased, although their growth did not match the rapid growth in foreign holdings of U. S. securities. At $ 1. 8 trillion, the value of U. S. holdings of foreign long-term securities at the end of 2002 was less than half the value of foreign holdings of U. S. securities; this difference resulted in a negative net international position in long-term securities of $ 2. 3 trillion.; The U.

40|$|When-issued trading {{concerns}} <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{that have}} not yet been issued. This type of trade often takes place in a so-called ‘grey market’, in which all contracts are conditional on the issuance of the security. In this paper, we investigate the Dutch grey market for when-issued shares prior to stock splits and IPOs, using a unique, handcollected dataset. Stock splits {{are more likely to be}} preceded by when-issued trading when the underlying firm is larger, the relative trading volume of the stock is higher, and the stock return is less volatile. This implies that market makers are more likely to set up a when-issued market after a stock split announcement when the number of expected transactions is large and the expected costs are low. On the basis of when-issued and regular share closing prices, we calculate premiums of 0. 50 % to 1. 50 % on nearly all of the 50 trading days leading up to the stock split. When corrected for the time value of money, these when-issued securities trade at a small but economically significant premium of on average about 0. 60 % over the regular shares during a limited period before the effective date of the stock split. However, this when-issued premium disappears in the last days prior to the stock split. In the case of when-issued trading in the run-up to an IPO, we find that the prices paid in the grey market are in line with the first day closing prices. This confirms the findings of Löffler, Panther and Theissen (2005) that pre-IPO prices are highly informative. ...|$|E
