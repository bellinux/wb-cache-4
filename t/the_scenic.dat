5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, a private American ship {{became the first}} {{non-indigenous}} vessel to enter the river; {{it was followed by}} a British explorer, who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley.

5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>scenic</b> highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt to bring people back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Other attractions {{that closed}} {{at about the}} same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and the miniature railway.
