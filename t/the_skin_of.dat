5000|$|A {{small fire}} {{was built in}} the colder months, and easily kept the dwellers warm. These o-chums were able to provide housing to a family of six. To make the bedding, the natives would often use <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals that they shared the land with. The {{mattress}} was made from <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> bigger animals such as bears and deer. And the blanket was made from <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> smaller animals, cut into strips and woven together for extra warmth.|$|R

5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth {{then make a}} 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{transmission}} {{is the most}} common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; blood is exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> a host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
5|$|In 1767 Pennant {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} the Royal Society. About this time he met the much-travelled Sir Joseph Banks and visited him at his home in Lincolnshire. Banks {{presented}} him with <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> a new species of penguin recently brought back from the Falkland Islands. Pennant wrote an account of this bird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and all the other known species of penguin which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} is likely being reduced due to habitat fragmentation, as many areas with historical records {{have been turned}} into croplands. Prior to the Second World War <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> Abyssinian genets were recorded for sale in markets in Addis Ababa market, it is unknown whether {{there is still a}} market for <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> this species. In general this species is too poorly known to properly assess its conservation status.|$|R

5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as {{it does not have}} a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> a related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have}} been smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on the underside of its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2015, Lapierre {{was traded}} from the Blues to the Pittsburgh Penguins in {{exchange}} for Marcel Goc. Lapierre {{played a key role}} during the 2015 playoffs, getting under <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the New York Rangers by drawing penalties, instigating fights, taunting and most notably doing play-by-play towards the Rangers' bench. He played an important role on the face-off dot and on the penalty kill, frustrating the New York Rangers and his former head coach in Vancouver, Alain Vigneault.|$|E
50|$|The Calpinae are a {{subfamily}} of moths in the Erebidae family. This subfamily {{includes many}} species of moths that have a pointed and barbed proboscis adapted to piercing <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> fruit to feed on juice, {{and in the case}} of the several Calyptra species of vampire moths, to piercing <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> mammals to feed on blood. The subfamily contains some large moths with wingspans longer than 5 cm (2 in).|$|R

5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} Frank's Cock has been {{published}} several times, including in the script anthology By <b>the</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>of</b> Their Tongues and in the Journal of Film and Video (both 1997). The film influenced Adam Garnet Jones' Secret Weapons (2008), commissioned by the Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre in celebration of its fortieth anniversary. However, unlike Frank's Cock, Secret Weapons focused on an LGBT identity within Canada's native community.|$|E
5|$|The sebaceous glands {{of a human}} fetus secrete a {{substance}} called vernix caseosa, a waxy, translucent white substance coating <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> newborns. After birth, activity of the glands decreases until {{there is almost no}} activity during ages 2–6 years, and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty, due to heightened levels of androgens.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
50|$|Cholestenol is a sterol {{that has}} been found in <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> rats. It can be {{converted}} to cholesterol in mammals. Delta-7-cholestenol is also known as lathosterol.|$|R
50|$|The {{leader of}} the fierce Kashuga (Kaska) tribe, who works for Queen Nakia. Larger than the average man, he is also very bloodthirsty and sadistic, {{collecting}} <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> his human victims, much like a hunter would collect <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> <b>of</b> animals, and crafting his attire from them. After killing Tito, he meets his end, outmaneuvered and outsmarted, by Yuri's hands, who shatters his outsized copper sword and the mud bricks beneath his feet with an iron blade, causing him to fall to his death from the palace walls.|$|R
