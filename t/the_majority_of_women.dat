5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were still wearing highly {{structured}} undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady {{the challenges of}} feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of}} the miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E

25|$|While {{the use of}} tocolytic agents or the {{development}} of preeclampsia (toxemia of pregnancy) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) {{may contribute to the}} worsening of heart failure, they do not cause PPCM; <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> have developed PPCM who neither received tocolytics nor had preeclampsia nor PIH.|$|E
25|$|After Corday murdered Marat, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> distanced {{themselves}} from her {{because they believed}} that {{what she had done}} would spark a reaction against the now developing feminist movement, which was already facing criticism. Also, many of these women were attached to Marat in that they were supporters of his revolutionary efforts and sympathized with him as citizens of France.|$|E

25|$|General {{statistics}} {{indicate that}} 70–80% of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm. The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris and anus, and therefore intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation {{is less likely}} to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation, however, is rare among women.|$|E
25|$|To {{capitalize}} on the enlisted women's experience, commission status was open to them beginning in July 1943. To be eligible, the applicant had to have completed six months of service, be recommended by her commanding officer, and be selected by a board {{of male and female}} officers. After October 1943, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> officers came from the ranks; only civilian women with specialized skills or exceptional leadership qualities were accepted for officer training.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS {{cases were}} reported; 38 deaths {{resulted}} from the disease. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble. The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E

25|$|After {{hysterectomy}} for benign indications <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> report {{improvement in}} sexual life and pelvic pain. A smaller share of women report worsening of sexual life and other problems. The picture is significantly different for hysterectomy performed for malignant reasons; {{the procedure is}} often more radical with substantial side effects. A proportion of patients who undergo a hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain continue to suffer from pelvic pain after a hysterectomy and develop dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse).|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} the effect of hormonal contraceptive use in women on the frequency of sexual intercourse. Many of these contraceptives mimic a pregnancy state in females by altering hormone levels. Therefore, women who use these contraceptives do not experience the fertile phases of their cycles. In a systematic review, {{it appeared that the}} frequency of sexual intercourse was unaffected by contraceptive use in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> Although artificially created, this adds to the literature documenting the existence of copulation in humans during non-fertile periods.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{the most}} recent year {{reported}}, 69% of Peace Corps crime victims were women, 88% were under 30, and 82% were Caucasian. Worldwide, there were 15 cases of rape/attempted rape and 96 cases of sexual assault reported for a total of 111 sexual crimes committed against female Peace Corps volunteers. This was all shared on ABC news 20/20. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> who join the Peace Corps are in their mid-twenties. In 62% of the more than 2,900 assault cases since 1990, the victim was identified as being alone. In 59% of assault cases, the victim was identified as a woman in her 20s. At that time the media began to report all these numbers and facts.|$|E

25|$|Before the 19th century, {{young women}} lived under the {{economic}} and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed {{under the control of}} their husbands. In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages. Before 1789, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> lived confined to society’s private sphere, the home.|$|E
25|$|Statistical data {{proves that}} <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> {{work in the}} service and {{domestic}} sectors while men work in the production sector. According to data from the 1940s, gender equality existed neither {{in the domain of}} work nor in the area of politics in the kibbutzim of the time. For instance, in 1948, in eight kibbutzim of the Ihud, a kibbutz federation with a pragmatic socialist orientation, 78.3 percent of the women worked in services (services for adults, child care, education) as compared with 16.7 percent of the men. That same year, 15.2 percent of the women worked in production as distinct from 58.2 percent of the men. The situation was the same in political life.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> {{believe that}} antenatal care from a health {{professional}} {{is necessary to}} determine that their pregnancy is normal, {{to see that the}} fetus is well-positioned, to learn about when they were expected to deliver, to obtain a tetanus immunization, for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses during pregnancy, and nutritional advice. The barriers to seeking antenatal care include travel time and distance from health care facilities, the high cost, and the inconvenient hours of operations of the clinics. Some women also did not want people to know they were pregnant until their third month of pregnancy, and would wait until then to seek antenatal care. Inexpensive care from traditional birth attendants included routine antenatal care, however untrained attendants and traditional healers did not provide antenatal care.|$|E

25|$|These {{people then}} shifted to Torres Strait — {{maintaining}} established ties with Papua {{as well as}} with Austronesian speakers further east (this latter being suggested by various characteristics of the Austronesian content in Kalau Lagaw Ya) — and overlaid an Australian population {{in such a way that}} <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> spoke an Australian language, with a significant number, mainly men, who spoke a South-East Papuan Austronesian language, accompanied by their Papuan wives and their perhaps bilingual children. Over time, the core structure of the local mothers' language dominated, with retention of the newcomers' Papuo-Austronesian content in the appropriate cultural subsystems. In essence this would have been a 'replay' of the original settlement by Austronesian traders at Parema, with the women understanding the language of the men, but not really needing to speak it while retaining parts of their language for significant areas. The children then created a new language shift to an Australian language with a Papuan-Austronesian admixture.|$|E
25|$|The Mayflower {{departed}} Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot {{ship had}} 102 passengers and {{a crew of}} about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined {{with a lack of}} proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come. After arriving at their destination, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter. During the voyage there was a turbulent storm during which John Howland fell overboard. He managed to grab a topsail halyard that was trailing in the water and was hauled back aboard safely.|$|E
500|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s saw {{the onset of}} stagflation. After his {{election}} in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms.
