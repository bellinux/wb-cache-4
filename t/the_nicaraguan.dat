Cortés responded courteously and offered supplies while the expedition was passing through Honduras, but sent letters advising Hernández de Córdoba to remain loyal to Pedrarias.|$|E
5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met <b>the</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> Maria Teresa Sanchez.

So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.|$|E

The British demanded an indemnity of £15,000. US Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham thought the demands harsh, but also that they should be met. US public opinion, however, was outraged at this British military activity in the United States' sphere of influence.|$|E

He allowed the CIA to establish listening posts in Panama, and also helped the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government against the leftist Salvadoran insurgent Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. U.S. spy ships used bases in Panama in their operations against <b>the</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> government, {{and much of the}} intelligence gathered by these ships was processed in the U.S. bases in Panama. Noriega permitted these activities despite the Panama Canal treaties restricting the use of the U.S. bases to protecting the canal.|$|E

5|$|For {{several days}} {{toward the end}} of October 1961, a {{low-pressure}} area persisted in the western Caribbean Sea, north of the Panama Canal Zone. On October25, an upper-level anticyclone moved over the low; the next day, a trough over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable outflow for the disturbance. At 0000UTC on October27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46mph (74km/h). Later that day, the airport on San Andres Island reported easterly winds of 60mph (95km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70miles (110km) southeast of San Andres, or 155mi (250km) east of <b>the</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> coast; as a result, the Miami Weather Bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Groves {{departed}} for Nicaragua {{in charge of}} a company of the 1st Engineers as part of an expedition whose purpose was to conduct a survey for the Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal. Following the 1931 Nicaragua earthquake, Groves took over responsibility for Managua's water supply system, for which he was awarded <b>the</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> Presidential Medal of Merit. Groves was promoted to captain on 20 October 1934. He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and 1936, after which he was posted to Kansas City, Missouri, as assistant to the commander of the Missouri River Division. In 1938 and 1939 he attended the Army War College. On 1 July 1939, he was posted to the War Department General Staff in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Light {{wind shear}} allowed Ida to quickly intensify as it slowly tracked towards <b>the</b> <b>Nicaraguan</b> coastline. Late on November4, {{microwave}} satellite imagery depicted an eye-like featured forming within the storm. The storm tracked west-northwestward {{in response to}} a weak ridge over the north-central Caribbean Sea and a weak trough over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico; these features were also responsible for Ida's slow forward motion. Early on November 5, the storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale as it passed near the Corn Islands. At approximately 1117 UTC, the center of Ida made landfall near Rio Grande, Nicaragua, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). After the hurricane moved inland, the high mountains of Nicaragua caused the convection associated with the hurricane to diminish, resulting in rapid weakening. Roughly 18 hours after landfall, Ida weakened to a tropical depression as it turned northward over Honduras.|$|E
