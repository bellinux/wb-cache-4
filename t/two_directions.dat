5|$|In 1820–21, {{the federal}} land surveys {{had reached the}} disputed area from <b>two</b> <b>directions,</b> {{progressing}} southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio. For unknown reasons, Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to close on the Northwest Ordinance (Fulton) line, rather than Harris' line, perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan's claims over Ohio's. Thus, townships that were established north of the line assumed {{they were part of}} Michigan Territory. By the early 1820s, the growing territory reached the minimum population threshold of 60,000 to qualify for statehood. When Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833, Congress rejected the request because of the still-disputed Toledo Strip.|$|E

5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E

5|$|Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) was a {{business}} loop in Saginaw that was previously Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23). It started at an interchange between I-75/US23 and M-46 (Holland Road) in Buena Vista Township. From there, it ran concurrently with M-46 westward into Saginaw. East of 17th Street, the highway split to form a one-way pairing with Remington Street, which carried westbound traffic. About three blocks further west, BL I-75 split from M-46 to follow Genesee Avenue northwesterly into the downtown area. At an intersection between Genesee Avenue, Janes Street and 2nd Avenue, the northbound BL I-75 followed 2nd Avenue while southbound continued on Genesee Avenue. Northbound traffic traveled along 2nd Avenue and Johnson Street to Washington Avenue near the Saginaw River, where the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> of traffic reunited.
