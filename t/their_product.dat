5|$|Several {{commercial}} mushroom ketchups {{were produced}} in the United Kingdom; some of the brands included Crosse and Blackswell's Mushroom Catsup, Morton's Mushroom Ketchup and Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup.

5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} {{it into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to mislead consumers by confusing <b>their</b> <b>product</b> with Jif.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the North American market {{accounted}} for over 10% of the company's net sales. Nokian Tyres has a tyre subsidiary based in LaVergne, Tennessee (USA). In that market, Nokian Tyres sell only to independent dealers, {{some of whom}} use the tyre products to fill in gaps in <b>their</b> <b>product</b> lines instead of an exclusive or majority share. This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre's full tyre product range.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove {{to meet the demands}} for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner.

By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was then that they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, who had heard of their project and wanted to show them his similar project he was working on.|$|E

5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, it must also divide the left-hand side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma. Specifically, if a prime number divides L, then it must divide at least one factor of L. Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to <b>their</b> <b>product,</b> a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E
5|$|The Radiation Laboratory {{forwarded}} {{the preliminary}} designs for a production plant to Stone & Webster {{before the end}} of the year, but one important issue remained unsettled. Oppenheimer contended that weapons-grade uranium would have to be 90% pure uranium-235. Edward Lofgren and Martin Kamen thought that this could not be achieved without a second stage of enrichment. The two stages became known as Alpha and Beta. In March 1943, Groves approved the construction of five Alpha and two Beta racetracks. In September, he authorized four more Alpha racetracks, which became known as Alpha II, along with two more Beta racetracks to process <b>their</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with <b>their</b> <b>product</b> equalling c.|$|E

5|$|Wines {{from the}} Languedoc can carry an {{enormous}} number of names, ranging from broad regional designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbières and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope. While these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving <b>their</b> <b>product,</b> others have criticized the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western American products to the east, starting with chilled meat from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to lose out from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were leaving for the east each day. Chilled butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah and Sierra Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship <b>their</b> <b>product</b> by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E
5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in <b>their</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
