5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>use</b> of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although never intended for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from ISK Biosciences Europe SA to set new MRLs for the active substance pyriofenone in cereal grains and grapes. In order to accommodate for <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>uses</b> of pyriofenone in northern and southern EU, the United Kingdom proposed to set an MRL of 0. 01 * mg/kg in wheat and rye, 0. 05 mg/kg in barley and oats and 0. 3 mg/kg in grapes. The United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 01 * mg/kg for <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>uses</b> on wheat and rye, 0. 03 mg/kg for barley and oats reflecting <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> NEU <b>uses</b> and 0. 3 mg/kg for grapes.

Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of pyriofenone in cereals and grapes.

In order to accommodate for <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> <b>uses</b> of acequinocyl in Germany, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRL in cucumbers from the LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg to 0. 08 mg/kg and concluded that insufficient data were provided to propose an MRL in melons and pumpkins. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 08 mg/kg for acequinocyl in cucumbers in support of <b>the</b> <b>intended</b> indoor <b>use.</b> <b>The</b> data were insufficient to support the outdoor NEU use on cucumbers and the indoor use on melons and pumpkins.

Germany drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005 which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to propose a MRL of 0. 2 mg/kg on salsify, 0. 5 mg/kg on herbal infusions (roots) and 0. 05 mg/kg (LOQ) on spices (seeds) and on caraway. <b>The</b> <b>intended</b> <b>uses</b> on swedes, turnips, celeriac and celery are not adequately supported by residue data and no MRL proposals can be therefore derived. Analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of pendimethalin in the crops under consideration, which are fully validated on salsify matrices; further validation data would be desirable on herbal infusions and spices. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of pendimethalin on salsify, herbal infusions (roots), spices (seeds) and caraway will not result in a exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R
