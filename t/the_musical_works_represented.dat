By employing its structural elements it is possible to make a solid framework within which the comprehensive review {{of the origin of}} the work can be given.

50|$|Statutory license {{regulations}} {{dictate that}} digital transmissions of public performances of sound recordings need permissions from {{two sets of}} copyright owners—the owners of <b>the</b> <b>musical</b> <b>work</b> (usually <b>the</b> songwriter or the composer) and {{the owners of the}} sound recordings themselves (usually a record label, unless the artists own their own master recordings).
