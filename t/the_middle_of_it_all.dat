5|$|Born to Donnell and June (née Mercer) Cook, David is {{the oldest}} of six children. He has written more than 2,500 songs, {{including}} Drop that Rock, which was featured on his album In <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> and garnered a Dove Award nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Mountainview Records {{released}} Cook's album, In <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>All,</b> {{which earned}} him a Gospel Music Association Dove Award nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999. However, after a fallout with Mountainview records in 1999, he started his own record label, DLC Records. During this period Cook created a comedy character, named Mortermer Crabbottom, {{in the tradition of}} comedic Southern characters like Gomer Pyle.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Cook started DLC Records {{after leaving}} Mountainview Records due to {{contractual}} and other disputes. While {{on the label}} Cook took his 1999 project, In <b>The</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>All,</b> up the charts garnering several #1 singles, a Dove Award nomination and became the number one selling Christian country artists of all time. He incorporated Cook Enterprises to administer his contracts and personal business affairs, which included a children's television show development agreement with his management group, Five Star Music which produced a weekly show called, Crabbottom USA, taped at local television station, WHTV TV-39, a Nashville Tennessee based station.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed {{over and over again}} until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Milligan and Harry Secombe {{became friends}} while {{serving in the}} Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first {{encountered}} Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe {{was sitting in a}} small wireless truck: [...] "Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan." [...] Secombe's answer to that question was [...] "What colour was it?" [...] Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.|$|E
2500|$|Huckstepp {{also went}} {{to the media and}} gave {{extensive}} interviews, claiming that Rogerson had murdered Lanfranchi and stolen $10,000 Lanfranchi was carrying to bribe Rogerson. She also claimed that Neddy Smith had lied to the inquest and was involved in a conspiracy with Rogerson. Rogerson maintained his innocence. In Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith, Smith wrote that Lanfranchi was [...] "attempting to bribe Rogerson. I was the person that took Warren to this fatal meeting. There was an inquest and both sides threw plenty of shit at one another. I was right in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> I could do nothing to bring Warren back to life, so I did the best thing I could. I know Warren’s family suffered deeply, but I cannot do anything about it." [...] He goes on to claim {{that as a result of}} his testimony at the inquest, Rogerson and other corrupt police officers gave him a [...] "green light" [...] to commit crime without fear of prosecution.|$|E

Truly, it runs like a shuttle {{throughout}} all Hind. And my share and my joy'--he smiled to the darkness--'I owe to the lama here. Also to Mahbub Ali--also to Creighton Sahib, but chiefly to the Holy One.

6000|$|In vain did {{his wife}} urge every objection; {{the more she}} argued, the more {{determined}} was her husband. 'I know how to obey orders,' he said, 'and these are as plain as the nose on my face!' So the princess was summoned, and, somewhat to their surprise, she seemed to take the news very calmly; next Nur Mahomed was informed, and he was greatly startled, {{but of course he}} could but be delighted at the great and unexpected honour which he thought the king had done him. Then all the castle was turned upside down; and when the news spread in the town, THAT was turned upside down too. Everybody ran everywhere, and tried to do everything at once; and, in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> the old governor went about with his hair standing on end, muttering something about 'obeying orders.' ...|$|E

He was desperately in earnest and I felt more wretched than I ever did in my life. I couldn't promise him that--why, even if there was no {{question}} of Ken, I don't care for Fred that way and never could--but it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort. I cried like a baby; and yet--oh, I am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me, because, right in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> with me crying and Fred looking so wild and tragic, the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose across from me at the breakfast table every morning of my life. There, {{that is one of the}} entries I wouldn't want my descendants to read in this journal. But it is the humiliating truth; and perhaps it's just as well that thought did come or I might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance. If Fred's nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened. And then what an unthinkable predicament I should have been in! ...|$|E
6000|$|Jackson {{had called}} [...] "Time," [...] {{and the two}} mud-plastered men were already upon their feet, but the {{interest}} had suddenly changed from the fight to the audience. A succession of heaves {{from the back of}} the crowd had sent a series of long ripples running through it, all the heads swaying rhythmically in the one direction like a wheatfield in a squall. With every impulsion the oscillation increased, those in front trying vainly to steady themselves against the rushes from behind, until suddenly there came a sharp snap, two white stakes with earth clinging to their points flew into the outer ring, and a spray of people, dashed from the solid wave behind, were thrown against the line of the beaters-out. Down came the long horse-whips, swayed by the most vigorous arms in England; but the wincing and shouting victims had no sooner scrambled back a few yards from the merciless cuts, before a fresh charge from the rear hurled them once more into the arms of the prize-fighters. Many threw themselves down upon the turf and allowed successive waves to pass over their bodies, whilst others, driven wild by the blows, returned them with their hunting-crops and walking-canes. And then, as half the crowd strained to the left and half to the right to avoid the pressure from behind, the vast mass was suddenly reft in twain, and through the gap surged the rough fellows from behind, all armed with loaded sticks and yelling for [...] "Fair play and Gloucester!" [...] Their determined rush carried the prize-fighters before them, the inner ropes snapped like threads, and in an instant the ring was a swirling,' seething mass of figures, whips and sticks falling and clattering, whilst, face to face, in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> so wedged that they could neither advance nor retreat, the smith and the west- countryman continued their long-drawn battle as oblivious of the chaos raging round them as two bulldogs would have been who had got each other by the throat. The driving rain, the cursing and screams of pain, the swish of the blows, the yelling of orders and advice, the heavy smell of the damp cloth--every incident of that scene of my early youth comes back to me now in my old age as clearly as if it had been but yesterday.|$|E
