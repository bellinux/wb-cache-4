50|$|In {{early and}} middle 20th century {{telephone}} exchanges this task {{was done by}} a supervisory relay set known variously as junctor circuit or district junctor. Later designs made it {{a function of the}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> or absorbed it into software.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R
25|$|These voltage {{changes on}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> would cause pops or clicks that were audible to the {{subscriber}} as the electrical handshaking stepped through its protocol. Another handshake, to start timing for billing purposes, caused {{a second set of}} clunks when the called party answered.|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of signals}} {{communicating}} supervision or call progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>trunks</b> were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used analog <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that were}} designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> between switches.|$|R

50|$|Also taking {{advantage}} of the superior versatility of 5XB, Centrex was invented as a service package. Later stored program control exchanges allowed more extensive service features. Autovon originally used a four-wire version of 5XB, with a more complex marker to implement its nonhierarchical polygrid routing system, and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> with additional logic and data storage built in to implement preemption.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R

50|$|The {{signaling}} unit and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> communicate their status over the E and M leads, {{using a combination}} of Battery and Earth (also known as Ground). The Battery signal used in the standard is nominally −48VDC. All E&M installations require that the +ve terminal of the Battery is connected to a shared reliable Earth. The maximum distance between the Signaling Unit and the Trunk interface is determined by the resistance of the wire, but will normally be less than 100m for adequate noise immunity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{electrical}} system {{on a ship}} is well contained. Among the challenges proffered by naval systems is real time monitoring {{for the purpose of}} fault analysis and reconfiguration. The system can be considered as a grid of interconnected or <b>terminated</b> <b>trunk</b> lines, each with its own equivalent parallel load impedance and series transmission impedance. An algorithm is presented for predicting these equivalent impedances in subcycle intervals even through a transient. A precipitous drop in the magnitude of a load impedance earmarks the onset of a fault. The sensitivity of this approach to measured signal to noise ratio is investigated. Examples are shown to demonstrate how the magnitude and phase of equivalent load impedances change through unbalanced faults...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Stored Program Control {{came to live}} up to {{its promise}} of versatility, and Centrex {{customers}} were among the first in the middle 1970s to be removed from 5XB to 1ESS switch. Complex logic and storage was cheaper in a central computer than in individual <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> hence outgoing calls could be transferred as easily as incoming. Other manufacturers produced similar services, usually calling them something else due to trademark considerations. Northern Electric (later known as Nortel) called their version IBN or Integrated Business Network and enhanced the service with their proprietary P-phone sets in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The first off-island {{telephone}} link {{was established in}} 1929, with the laying of a cable by the CS Faraday between Port Erin and Ballyhornan in Northern Ireland, a distance of 57 km, and then between Port Grenaugh and Blackpool, primarily to provide a link to Northern Ireland. The cable was completed on 6 June 1929 and the first call between the Isle of Man and the outside world was made on 28 June 1929 by Lieutenant Governor Sir Claude Hill in Douglas to the Postmaster General in Liverpool. The cable initially carried only two <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Via Net Loss (VNL) is {{a network}} {{architecture}} of telephone systems using circuit switching technologies {{deployed in the}} 1950s with Direct Distance Dialing and used until the late 1980s. The purpose of the VNL plan and a five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> used during a call and maximize the voice quality achieved on each circuit.

5000|$|With a clean FCG test, {{the call}} {{completion}} software told the [...] "A" [...] relay in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to operate, connecting its transmission and test hardware to the switching fabric {{and thus to}} the line. Then, for an outgoing call, the trunk's scan point would scan {{for the presence of}} an off hook line. If the short was not detected, the software would command the printing of a [...] "Supervsion Failure" [...] (SUPF) and try again with a different junctor. A similar supervision check was performed when an incoming call was answered. Any of these tests could alert for the presence of a bad crosspoint.|$|R
2500|$|When {{a calling}} party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The {{operator}} responded by inserting the rear cord (answering cord) into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, [...] "Number, please?" [...] For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord {{of the pair}} (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long distance call, she plugged into a <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote central office. In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes.|$|R
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the {{incoming}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to control ringing and to return busy tone. 5XB uses a ringing selection switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks. The various levels provide various tones, and ringing current of various durations and cadences (especially valuable for party lines). Levels 0 and 1 {{are used as}} discriminating levels to set polarity for selective ringing on tip side or ring side. An especially sensitive wire spring RT relay is used to detect off-hook from a line being rung, release the RSS hold magnet, and engage the shielded supervision relay so reverse battery answer supervision would {{be returned to the}} originating end.|$|R

50|$|Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury was {{the first}} iron-framed {{building}} {{in the world in}} 1797. Thomas Bolton & Sons of Froghall, Staffordshire, made the world's first transatlantic telegraph cable in 1857, having supplied a submarine cable across the English Channel in 1850. GEC Telecommunications was headquartered at the GEC Telephone and Radio Works in Coventry, it has now become the New Century Park, off the A428 north of Stoke Aldermoor in eastern Coventry. On 10 July 1890, a <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> telephone line was opened between London and Birmingham by the National Telephone Company; {{for the first time this}} allowed phone calls between the London and the north. The world's first coaxial cable was laid between London and Birmingham in 1936 to give 40 channels for telephone traffic. and brought into use in 1938, later extended to Manchester in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The {{card sorter}} of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six digit {{translation}} of the central office code number dialed by the customer. This determined the proper <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities {{in the same area}} code, {{as in the case of}} Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. On busy days, it sounded like a machine gun firing. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.|$|R
50|$|The term is {{typically}} used with mobile telephony systems, {{in which there}} are simply not enough radio channels available in a given cell or cells.

50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk junctor switches in the trunk link frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|R
50|$|Supervision and trunk {{signalling}} {{were the}} responsibility of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> The most common kinds (reverse battery one-way trunks) were in plug-in trunk packs, two trunks per pack, 128 packs per Trunk Frame (originally) on 16 shelves. Each trunk pack was originally about 3x5x8 inches (8x12x20 cm) with edge connector in the back. The later 1AESS were made with shorter wire spring relays, making them less than half as wide, with more complex leaf spring connector. Trunk Frames were in pairs, the even numbered one having the Signal Distributor to control the relays in both. Most trunks had three wire spring relays and two scan points. They could supply regular battery or reverse battery to a line, and on-hook or off-hook supervision to the distant end, or be put into a bypass state allowing all functions (usually sending and receiving address signals) to be performed by common control circuits such as digit transmitters and receivers. Slightly more complex trunks, for example those going to TSPS offices for operator control, were packaged as only one per plugin unit.|$|R

5000|$|Trunks Integrated Record Keeping System (TIRKS) is an {{operations}} support system from Telcordia Technologies (since acquired by Ericsson, Inc.), originally developed by the Bell System during the late 1970s.

It grew to encompass and automate many functions required to build the ever-expanding data transport network. Supporting circuits from POTS and 150 baud modems up through T1, DS3, SONET and DWDM, it continues to evolve today, and unlike many software technologies today, provides complete backward compatibility. TIRKS was recently updated with a Java GUI, XML API, and WORD Sketch, which provides graphical views of the TIRKS Work Order Record and Details Document as well as SONET and DWDM networks. When TIRKS became a registered trademark in 1987, it became technically improper {{to use it as}} an acronym. TIRKS was one of many OSS technologies transferred to Bell Communications Research as part of the Modification of Final Judgment related to the AT&T divestiture on January 1, 1984.

5000|$|The telex {{numbering}} plan, {{usually a}} six-digit {{number in the}} United States, {{was based on the}} major exchange where the customer's telex machine terminated. For example, all telex customers that terminated in the New York City exchange were assigned a telex number that started with a first digit [...] "1". Further, all Chicago-based customers had telex numbers that started with a first digit of [...] "2". This numbering plan was maintained by Western Union as the telex exchanges proliferated to smaller cities in the United States. The Western Union Telex network was built on three levels of exchanges. The highest level was made up of the nine exchange cities previously mentioned. Each of these cities had the dual capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections to multiple distant telex exchanges. The second level of exchanges, located in large cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami, Newark, Pittsburgh and Seattle, were similar to the highest level of exchanges in capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections. However, these second level exchanges had a smaller customer line capacity and only had <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> to regional cities. The third level of exchanges, located in small to medium-sized cities, could terminate telex customer lines and had a single trunk group running to its parent exchange.|$|R
