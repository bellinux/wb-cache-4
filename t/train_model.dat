These sessions were between 1 and 15 days (‘I’ groups); 16 and 30 days (‘II’ groups); or 31 and 45 day (‘III’ groups) after hatching. Otherwise the subjects were reared either in isolation (groups Ii, IIi, IIIi) or in pars with a pullet (groups I♀, II♀, III♀). Sexual tests giving a choice between the <b>training</b> <b>model</b> and a novel model or a conspecific, were performed at maturity (5 months). Following responses during training suggested that all birds except group IIIi had established a strong filial attachment bond with their model. Results of tests on adults showed that the birds in group IIIi, with weak filial attachments to the <b>training</b> <b>model,</b> were however strongly sexually imprinted with the <b>training</b> <b>model.</b> The birds in groups Ii and IIi, with strong filial attachment to the <b>training</b> <b>model,</b> did not generally attempt to mate with the <b>training</b> <b>model.</b> All socially reared birds mated preferentially with the conspecific choice object but they also mated with the <b>training</b> <b>model</b> towards which they were all previously filially attached.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the preclinical use of a <b>training</b> <b>model</b> in local anesthesia teaching on the subsequent clinical administration of a local anesthetic. Sixty-five dental students gave their first injection to a fellow dental student: twenty-two students after previous experience on a <b>training</b> <b>model</b> and forty-three without this training. After the injection, the opinions of both the student who performed the injection and the recipient were explored by questionnaires. Use of a <b>training</b> <b>model</b> did not affect the self-reported opinion of the students who performed the injection. However, the recipients of the injection considered students who exercised on the <b>training</b> <b>model</b> significantly more confident and calm, and reported a near-significant decrease in level of pain during insertion of the needle and feeling of a tingling lip.
