5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E
5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E
25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} {{to understand that they}} are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> are like and what <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E

Brit and Candy carry on, killing Big Arch's gang before confronting and killing Big Arch himself. During the assault and its aftermath, the camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a voice-over, first heard earlier in the film, {{describing}} the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> are. Brit and Candy, silent and wearing pensive, ambiguous expressions, drive home in Big Arch's Lamborghini. A final flashback shows the pair kissing Alien's dead body.|$|E

25|$|However, landlords {{routinely}} {{used the}} personal cultivation clause to evict tenants. There was another major barrier. A tenant {{would have to}} formally register his status (as a tenant) with the government. But few tenants registered, faced as they were with potential intimidation from their landlords, the removal of other forms of support such as consumption credit, {{and the prospect of}} a long and arduous legal battle if <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> wanted to dispute an eviction. Given this imbalance, landlords regularly exploited their tenants, either evicting them just before the harvest season, or giving them a lower share of the produce then they were entitled to, or refusing to give loans or charging extremely high rates of interest on loans taken for agricultural investments by the bargadar.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially {{known as}} Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This {{dates back to}} 1682, when the StMichael's church tower collapsed. The {{authorities}} were strapped for cash and saw {{no option but to}} sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the copper.|$|E

25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E
25|$|After the Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj ("Armed Forces Delegation for Homeland") was disbanded, another post-AK {{resistance}} organisation was formed, called Wolność i Niezawisłość ("Freedom and Sovereignty"). Its {{primary goal}} was not combat - Wolność i Niezawisłość (WiN) {{was more concerned}} with helping former AK soldiers {{make the transition from}} a life as partisans to that of civilians. Continued secrecy and conspiracy were necessary in light of the increasing persecution of AK veterans by the communist government. WiN was, however, much in need of funds to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and entire life-savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, WiN was far from efficient. A significant victory for the NKVD and the newly created Polish secret police, Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (UB), came {{in the second half of}} 1945, when they managed to convince several leaders of WiN that <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> wanted to offer amnesty to AK members. Within a few months, intelligence gathered by the authorities led to thousands more arrests. The primary period of WiN activity lasted until 1947. The organisation finally disbanded in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Under the empire, the {{citizens}} {{were divided into}} three classes, and for members of each class, a distinct career path was available (known as the cursus honorum). The traditional magistracies were only available to citizens of the senatorial class. The magistracies that survived {{the fall of the}} republic were (by their order of rank per the cursus honorum) the Consulship, Praetorship, Plebeian Tribunate, Aedileship, Quaestorship, and Military Tribunate. If an individual was not of the senatorial class, he could run for one of these offices if he was allowed to run by the emperor, or otherwise, he could be appointed to one of these offices by the emperor. During the transition from republic to empire, no office lost more power or prestige than the Consulship, which was due, in part, {{to the fact that the}} substantive powers of republican Consuls were all transferred to the emperor. Imperial Consuls could preside over the senate, could act as judges in certain criminal trials, and had control over public games and shows. The Praetors also lost a great deal of power, and ultimately had little authority outside of the city. The chief Praetor in Rome, the Urban Praetor, outranked all other Praetors, and for a brief time, they were given power over the treasury. Under the empire, the Plebeian Tribunes remained sacrosanct, and, in theory at least, retained the power to summon, or to veto, the senate and the assemblies. Augustus divided the college of Quaestors into two divisions, and assigned one division the task of serving in the senatorial provinces, and the other the task of managing civil administration in Rome. Under Augustus, the Aediles lost control over the grain supply to a board of commissioners. It wasn't until after they lost the power to maintain order in the city, however, that <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> became powerless, and the office disappeared entirely during the 3rd century.|$|E

Phineas's birth father is never present or discussed in the series, something Marsh and Povenmire have stated that they fully intend to keep that way. It is established that his mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher married Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher, after dating him for a while in the 1990s. <b>They</b> <b>truly</b> fell in love at a concert of the fictitious band [...] "Love Händel" [...] after they were put on the kiss cam.|$|E
500|$|The {{central issue}} in Chinese Zen {{philosophy}} of mind {{is in the}} difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master Huangpo described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts. [...] The pure Buddha-mind is thus able to see things [...] "as <b>they</b> <b>truly</b> are", as absolute and non-dual [...] "thusness" [...] (Tathatā). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between samsara and nirvana.|$|E
