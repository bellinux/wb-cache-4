25|$|In {{his inaugural}} address, Polk called upon Congress to re-establish the Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>System</b> under which {{government}} funds {{were held in}} the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions. President Van Buren had previously established a similar system, {{but it had been}} abolished during the Tyler administration. After personally winning the support of Senator Dixon Lewis, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Polk was able to push the Independent Treasury Act through Congress, signing it into law on August 6, 1846. The act provided that the public revenues were to be retained in the Treasury building and in sub-treasuries in various cities, separate from private or state banks, to receive all government funds. The system would remain in place until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.|$|E

This guidance, which was finalized in September 1997, provides “how to” processes for developing an information systems architecture {{in accordance with}} TISAF.

25|$|As a {{solution}} to the panic, he supported an Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>system,</b> which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation. However, a coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero William Henry Harrison and former Jacksonian John Tyler in the 1840 presidential election. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats during Jackson's campaigns. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a man of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee. He favored the nomination of James K. Polk of Tennessee for vice president at the 1840 Democratic National Convention over unpopular incumbent Richard Mentor Johnson. However, no nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.|$|E
500|$|The panic {{might have}} deepened {{if not for}} the {{intervention}} of financier J. P. Morgan, who pledged large sums of his own money, and convinced other New York bankers to do the same, to shore up the banking system. This highlighted the impotence of the nation's Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>system,</b> which managed the nation's money supply, yet was unable to inject liquidity back into the market. By November, the financial contagion had largely ended, only {{to be replaced by a}} further crisis. [...] This was due to the heavy borrowing of a large brokerage firm that used the stock of Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company (TC) as collateral. Collapse of TC's stock price was averted by an emergency takeover by Morgan's U.S. Steel Corporation—a move approved by anti-monopolist president Theodore Roosevelt. The following year, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., established and chaired a commission to investigate the crisis and propose future solutions, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hedging foreign {{currency}} risk {{is a central}} task for treasuries of multinational corporations. Traditionally, it has strongly relied on voice-based broking. With the advent of Internet technology, online platforms for foreign exchange trading emerged offering corporations a single point {{of access to the}} liquidity of a global market. However, online marketplaces only become truly valuable if seamlessly integrated into the corporation’s hedging process. This paper evaluates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} multi-bank online marketplaces, identifies the demanding and complex integration challenge and presents a Web Services-based straight-through processing implementation as a manageable approach to integrate online marketplaces and corporate <b>treasury</b> <b>systems</b> 1...|$|R
2500|$|In {{recent times}} {{there have been}} two major tax reforms in Norway. The first, the tax reform of 1992, was a {{pervasive}} and principle based reform, inline with the international trend of broader tax base and lower rates. Corporate taxation was designed so that the taxable profit should correspond to the actual budget surplus. [...] This meant, among other things that different industries, forms of ownership, financing methods and investment were treated equally (neutrality) and that revenues and related expenditures were subject to the same tax rate. In the personal income tax, a clearer distinction between labour income and investment income was introduced (split - a dual income tax system). Ordinary income, income less standard deductions and deductible expenses, was taxes at a flat rate of 28%. On personal income, income from work and pensions, there were in addition levied social security contributions and surtax. To avoid that income that was taxed at the corporate level also were taxed at the individual level (double taxation), the imputation tax credit for dividends and <b>treasury</b> <b>system</b> gains was introduced.|$|E
2500|$|As speaker, Polk {{worked for}} the {{policies}} of Jackson and later Van Buren. Polk appointed committees with Democratic chairs and majorities, including the New York radical C. C. Cambreleng as Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, although he maintained the facade of traditional bipartisanship. The two major issues during Polk's speakership were slavery and, after the Panic of 1837, the economy. Polk {{took advantage of the}} [...] "gag rule" [...] to quiet the slavery debate within the House. Van Buren and Polk faced pressure to rescind the Specie Circular, an act that had been signed by Jackson to boost the economy. The act required that payment for government lands be in gold and silver. However, with support from Polk and his cabinet, Van Buren chose to stick with the Specie Circular. Polk and Van Buren attempted to establish an Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>system</b> that would allow the government to oversee its own deposits (rather than using national or [...] "pet banks"), but the bill was defeated in the House.|$|E
2500|$|Polk is {{considered}} by many the last exceptional president of the pre–Civil War era, having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal set during his campaign and transition to office. After threatening war, [...] he reached a settlement with the United Kingdom over the disputed Oregon Country, whereby the territory was divided along the 49th parallel. Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican–American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the American Southwest. He ensured a substantial reduction of tariff rates with the Walker tariff of 1846, which pleased the less-industrialized southern states through less expensive imported and domestic goods. He also re-established the Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>System,</b> oversaw the opening of the United States Naval Academy and the Smithsonian Institution, the groundbreaking for the Washington Monument, and the issuance of the first United States postage stamp. True to his campaign pledge to serve only one term, Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee; he died of cholera three months afterwards.|$|E

40|$|<b>Treasury</b> <b>systems</b> in sub-Saharan Francophone African {{countries}} {{share many}} features with the French public expenditure management {{system of the}} 1960 s on which they were modelled. However, in a different economic and institutional environment, key elements of this framework have evolved in unexpected, unwelcome directions. This paper critically examines two main features of the French system in the sub-Saharan Francophone African context: the strict separation between the person ordering payment and the one disbursing funds, and the centralisation of funds in the treasury. This examination calls attention to – and suggests remedies for – the specific flaws that have evolved from the traditional framework. ...|$|R

The sample size for the study consisted of central treasury department and strategic business unitâ€™s employees and management. The research utilized both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected using in-depth interviews that were conducted with employees and top management. All secondary data were taken from the organisations internal documents, relevant journals and articles. Data collected was analyzed using qualitative techniques. The research aimed at shedding light on the impact of centralised treasury on the companyâ€™s flow of goods and services along the companyâ€™s business units. The results showed that finance managers from strategic business units are only involved in the consolidation of financial information. The research recommend for the need to establish an efficient hybrid treasury structure which combines the positive benefits of centralisation and decentralisation. The company also recommend for a supportive information technology system to complement effective decision making and resource allocation among the strategic business units. Additionally, the study recommends {{for the creation of a}} platform for resource mobilisation and deployment between corporate and subsidiaries so as to close the information gap and ensure transparency...|$|R

As a reward, Forward was offered the office of United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. He declined that appointment but on March 6, 1841 was appointed by President William Henry Harrison to be First Comptroller of the Treasury. He served in that post until September 13, 1841, when he was appointed 15th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President John Tyler.During his tenure as Treasury Secretary, the Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>System</b> of 1840 was abolished, and the government's funds were deposited once more with commercial banks. Soon after Forward took office, he was asked by Millard Fillmore, then chairman of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, to devise a plan to increase the tariff, {{in response to the}} serious decrease in revenue caused by the Panic of 1837. He was also asked to develop plans for a [...] "Board of Exchequer" [...] to receive and disburse customs revenue, since the Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>System</b> was no longer in effect. In August 1842 a strongly protective tariff was passed. Since constant friction with the new President marred his entire tenure as Secretary of the Treasury, he left Tyler's cabinet on February 28, 1843.|$|E

He favored the award of public lands to new states; endorsed a low tariff; opposed distribution of the federal surplus funds for fear of creating an excuse to raise tariff rates; and, significantly, supported the independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>system</b> idea.

The Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>System</b> was established under President Martin Van Buren, who extended Andrew Jackson's banking policies.

50|$|When the Panic of 1907 {{once again}} {{highlighted}} {{the inability of}} the system to stabilize the money market, Congress established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. The commission's work culminated in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and the demise of the Independent <b>Treasury</b> <b>System.</b> As a result, the Federal Reserve Act established the current U.S. Federal Reserve System and authorized the printing of Federal Reserve Notes (now commonly known as the U.S. Dollar). Government funds were gradually transferred from subtreasuries to the Federal Reserve, and a 1920 act of the 66th Congress (The Independent Treasury Act of 1920) mandated the closing of the last subtreasuries in the following year, thus bringing the system to an end.|$|E
