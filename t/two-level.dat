5|$|Apart {{from the}} criticisms that are {{commonly}} made of utilitarianism in general, {{there are several}} criticisms made specifically against <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|In this book, Hare {{applies the}} methods of <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism to {{problems}} in bioethics, such as abortion, and the treatment of people with psychiatric disorders using behaviour control techniques.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a <b>two-level</b> utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E

40|$|We analyze a 1 -d ring {{structure}} {{composed of}} many <b>two-levels</b> systems, in the limit where only one excitation is present. The <b>two-levels</b> systems are coupled to a common environment, where the exci- tation can be lost, which induces super and subradiant behavior. Moreover, each <b>two-levels</b> system is coupled to another independent environment, modeled by a classical white noise, simulating a dephasing bath and described by the Haken-Strobl master equation. Single exciton Superradiance, an example of cooperative quantum coherent effect, is destroyed at a critical dephasing strength proportional to the system size, showing robustness of cooperativity to {{the action of the}} dephasing environment. We also show that the coupling to a common decay channel contrasts the action of dephasing, driving the entanglement decay to slow down on increasing the system size. Moreover, after a projective measurement which finds the excitation in the system, the entanglement reaches a stationary value, independent of the initial conditions...|$|R
5|$|<b>Two-level</b> utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action {{is the one that}} is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E
5|$|Rideau Cottage is a {{historic}} residential building located {{on the grounds of}} Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Ontario. The <b>two-level,</b> 22-room Georgian Revival home is owned by the Canadian Crown and has traditionally been inhabited by persons associated with the Governor General of Canada, including the viceroy's private secretary. It is occupied by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} contains three sandstone fireplaces, and the countertops {{are finished}} with hand-painted tiles from Mexico. Myrtlewood is used inside as trim and for doors. Bedroom closets were constructed with drawers, shelves, and ironing boards built-in. Inside the <b>two-level</b> building are amenities such as dumbwaiters and a sewing room. On the outside raked cedar was {{used on the}} eaves of the low-pitched roof-line building. The exterior sandstone is tan, rose, and blue in color.|$|E

5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue a course of action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a bulldozer from the John F.

5|$|<b>Two-level</b> {{utilitarian}}ism (sometimes Government House utilitarianism) is a utilitarian {{theory of}} ethics developed by R. M. Hare. According to the theory, a person's moral decisions {{should be based}} on a set of 'intuitive' moral rules, except in certain rare situations where it is more appropriate to engage in a 'critical' level of moral reasoning.|$|E

40|$|A {{sequence}} of Ca K images obtained {{in a period}} of minimum solar activity, from July to November 1996, at the Rome Observatory with the PSPT (Precision Solar Photometric Telescope) prototype instrument have been used to analyze the geometrical properties of cells identified by the chromospheric network. In particular, we used 256 Θ 256 sub-arrays of the calibrated full disk PSPT images. These sub-arrays, centered on the solar disk, are reduced to <b>two-levels</b> (binary) images by means of a suitable threshold after an FFT highpass filtering. A medial axis transform, better known as skeleton, combined to a cellular automaton, is applied to the <b>two-levels</b> images, in order to derive the cell boundaries. The regions corresponding to the cells are then filled by a growing algorithm. In this way we can derive a set of output parameters describing the cells geometry.

5|$|The Torah ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the <b>two-level</b> Ark.|$|E
5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with {{a consideration of the}} relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Varner's second monograph, Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the <b>Two-Level</b> Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare, was {{published}} in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner {{had been working on}} questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the <b>Two-Level</b> Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition was the first, while the second, the forthcoming Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities, in under contract with the publisher. While Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, Sustaining Animals is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships. Varner is also co-authoring a textbook under contract with Cambridge University Press entitled Environmental Ethics for Environmentalists with the University of Guelph ecologist Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist.|$|E

They carried more {{vehicles in the}} same space and were easier to load and unload than the boxcars formerly used. Ever-larger auto carriers and specialized terminals were developed by Norfolk and Western Railway (N) and other carriers. Autoracks were built in three-level configurations carrying automobiles, and with <b>two-levels</b> for vans and light trucks.|$|R

5|$|After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill {{owned by}} the {{university}} was used to house returning veterans in military-style campus housing. During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent <b>two-level</b> townhouses {{for two or three}} students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles. South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics, Manley Field House, located in the Manley Athletics Complex.

5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Gary Edward Varner (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in {{environmental}} ethics, philosophical {{questions related to}} animal rights and animal welfare, and R. M. Hare's <b>two-level</b> utilitarianism. He is currently {{a professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University, and has been based at the university since 1990. He was educated at Arizona State University, the University of Georgia and the University of Wisconsin–Madison; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first doctoral theses on environmental ethics. Varner's first monograph was In Nature's Interests?, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of biocentric individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} endo-physics was {{introduced}} [1 - 2] {{in the context}} of self-reference in quantum physics and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Now, regarding quantum physics, it implicitly relies on something existing outer to itself, namely, the existence of an observer related to consciousness. In order to evaluate the relation of consciousness to (quantum) physics, it is necessary to recognise the fact that physical behaviour follows the principle of least action (action principle) which requires the behaviour to be directed towards the physical equilibrium. Now since biology follows a principle which acts against the physical principle, attempting to preserve the distance from physical equilibrium, and consciousness allegedly develops only in biological organism (at least in the observer concept of quantum physics), the observer lives on an ontologically different level from the physical realm [3 - 5]. Therefore, the epistemological structure of the observer-observed relation contains a <b>two-levelled</b> ontological structure. Regarding AI, it relies to “creators” of hardware and software, therefore its epistemology is that of the deistic materialism [6], i. e. another ontologically <b>two-levelled</b> structure. Now self-modification, the concept closely related to endophysics [7], is characteristic on a biological and/or psychological level o...|$|R

5|$|Rideau Cottage is a <b>two-level,</b> 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Stargate Command (SGC) base was {{supposed}} to match the real Cheyenne Mountain complex as much as possible. The set had to be twice as high for shooting as the 22 feet tall Stargate prop, but one of Hudolin's original plans of a three-level SGC set was rejected {{in favor of a}} <b>two-level</b> set. The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes. Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniel's lab, the cafeteria or the gym. The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Prometheus was built across a <b>two-level</b> structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage {{was built on the}} backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the {{interior of}} a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.|$|E
