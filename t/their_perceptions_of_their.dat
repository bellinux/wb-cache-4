50|$|When people {{surrounding}} {{an individual}} {{are able to}} correctly notice the personal identity that the individual is attempting to convey the self-esteem of the individual is increased.

This reassurance allows the individual to feel secure in their actions {{and be able to}} further predict the responses of others. These feelings of security allow the individual to express themselves in the manner they wish. This is why the positive emotions become so prominent for the individuals who experience this.

Undergraduate and graduate students who {{were enrolled in the}} ASC’s certificate program as of March 16, 2012 (n= 125) participated in an on-line student survey. Data are used to provide a descriptive analysis, significance tests, and a multiple regression analysis that examine six research questions. The descriptive analysis explores students’ characteristics, satisfaction with the certificate program, international experience, foreign language capability, {{and the extent to which}} the certificate program increases their global competency and skills for international careers. Tests were conducted to examine whether the differences in pre-post increases in students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency and skills development for international careers were statistically significant for all respondents as well as between disaggregated groups. The multiple regression analysis tests the correlation between three independent variables (courses taken in the certificate program, center activity participation, and students’ international experience) and each of the two dependent variables (students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> increased global competency and students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> improved skills for international careers). Findings show that significantly different changes in students’ <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency and skills development for international careers exist before their participation in the certificate program and after their participation in the certificate program. Students who stayed 1 - 6 months in an Asian country have the most significant increases in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency after their participation in the certificate program. Senior students have the most significant increases in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> global competency and skills for international careers after their participation in the certificate program. Students’ international experience and courses taken in the certificate program are important variables related to <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> increased global competency and improved skill for international careers.

In the autumn of 2011, a selfselected online survey about men’s sexual health was carried out in Norway, Croatia, and Portugal. A total of 657 Norwegian men over 18 years of age completed the entire questionnaire. The results from the present study stemmed from 220 healthy and married/cohabiting men, who had completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 44 years and the majority belonged to the upper middle class. Path analysis showed that the association between men’s sexual satisfaction and their satisfaction with {{the division of}} housework was partially mediated by emotional intimacy.
