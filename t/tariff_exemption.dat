This author argues that when <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> are granted {{as a means of}} industrial regional promotion to an industry independently of its export performance, the <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> lose their potential as an export promotion instrument. The case of Argentina is of interest because it exemplifies the practice of many developing countries. A simple model is used to show that the indiscriminate use of duty exemptions has several undesirable effects : 1) duty exemptions deprive the government of revenues; 2) the more widespread the exemption, the less effective they become as an instrument for export promotion; 3) exemptions widen the variability of effective protection rates of industries in relation to their capital intensity; and 4) exemptions increase the demand for imports more than an export subsidy does, because output in the competing input industry contracts.

Often, a toy manufacturer will reissue a toy from time to time, but its mere reissuance will not prohibit the reissued toy from itself correctly being identified as antique (many Lionel trains, for example, that were first issued in the 1950s have been reissued in the 1980s: each issue, {{as long as it}} is 25 years old, can fairly be termed 'antique'). Other areas of collecting, including those of furniture and automobiles, may have different criteria: the standard for furniture is generally that it must be at least 100 years old to qualify for <b>tariff</b> <b>exemption</b> (according to, for instance, the producers of the PBS television series 'Antiques Roadshow'), although there is considerable discussion and disagreement within the antique dealer profession; the standard for automobiles is 25 years or older (Antique Automobile Club of America, rule adopted in 1975).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Successive trade {{reforms have}} greatly opened the Chinese {{economy and the}} reforms offered for WTO {{accession}} involve further liberalization. To assess {{the implications of the}} tariff offers, we take into account the <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> that are especially important in China’s trade regime, and the reductions in the variability of tariffs at the tariff line level required by the WTO offers. The analysis suggests that these offers will result in real income gains of over $ 50 billion, benefiting both China and its major trading partners. Omitting the <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> is shown to result in over-estimation of the benefits from liberalization, while focusing on average tariff reductions leads to under-estimation.

30|$|In {{line with}} what has been stated above, {{increased}} concentration might influence sugar companies’ behaviour according to the SCP paradigm, potentially reducing internal competition. Individual measures may have different effects on the five forces. As mentioned above, the reduction of institutional prices {{is likely to increase}} cost competition (internal competition) among domestic sugar producers. The new quota system, together with continuing import duties regime, still protect domestic industry from competition (especially from generic Third Countries exporting to the EU market). In this framework, only exporting Countries under <b>tariff</b> <b>exemption</b> may increase the competition on the domestic market (depending on the import volume and on price differential between EU and world market), contributing to increase the market power of sugar purchasers (e.g. confectionery industry, retailers).|$|E
30|$|The {{reduction}} of import barriers {{makes it possible}} for Third Countries to sell increasing quantities of sugar in the EU market at reduced price and under preferential agreements (countries under <b>tariff</b> <b>exemption).</b> This situation is likely to occur because the revised quota system reduces EU domestic supply potential and, when the EU market price is higher than world price, those countries would find profitable to export to EU. Such import would increase pressure toward the {{reduction of}} domestic cost, depending on the importance of imported volume, of course. Once more, the downward revision of the quota system might push sugar firms to maintain or develop their production potential adopting the clause of re-allocation of national production or by other means (quota trade, mergers and acquisitions are typical means used in the sugar sector).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} the rule of origin (ROO) {{requirements}} accompanied by free trade agreements (FTAs), which specify the minimum portion of supplies that should satisfy the origin requirement, on a multinational firm’s production decisions. We consider a multinational firm who exports its product to multiple countries and analyze its production decision in the presence of multiple free trading agreements (FTAs). The ROO requirements in FTAs not only refer to the origin of supplies but are also involved with an environmental regulation of a country of the supplies. As such, meeting multiple ROO requirements can be costly since it may be involved with an adjustment of production facility and suppliers according to different environmental standards. We investigate a multinational firm’s choice of the ROO level in its production decision under multiple FTAs. It is well known that, in the presence of overlapping FTAs, the firm may strategically choose not to comply with the minimum ROO requirements in the FTAs. Instead, the firm may choose to comply with an ROO level that is higher than required, or pay the tariff instead without enjoying <b>tariff</b> <b>exemption</b> by the FTA in the new country. Such unintended outcomes in the FTAs are called the Spaghetti Bowl Effect.

The outcomes are however affected if <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> for intermediate and investment goods are modelled. If these exemptions are not introduced, the sector Textile declines while it expands if we take account of exemptions. The reason is that a large share of these goods is used for intermediate inputs.

Contrary to the policy objectives of CNLs, the excluded countries {{do not appear to be}} super competitive. In addition, we find some evidence of exporters increasing their exports of related products to the US after the CNL exclusion applies.

At their core, EPZs are {{a quid pro quo}} between host governments and investor companies: in exchange for the promise of job creation, technological transfer, economic development, and compliance with export performance requirements, investor companies receive substantial fiscal incentives, such as tax and <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions.</b> Most EPZ statutes are inconsistent with Article 3. 1 (a) of the World Trade Organization 2 ̆ 7 s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) because EPZ incentives qualify as prohibited export subsidies.

Incentives range from <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> on distribution and up to a 5 % guaranteed supply rights to regulated customers. Such conditions allow for a viable and fast growing environment for the developments of those generation systems based on the CSP which incorporate optimized storage systems. These systems are likely to {{play a vital role in}} meeting the increasing demand for energy from the copper mining sector in the north of Chile as well as that of the smaller electricity networks and local communities. In this direction, the University of Antofagasta, Chile, has developed the implementation and construction of a modular solar storage system, using new ternary and quaternary nitrate mixtures, where in addition to collecting the heat of industrial/mining processes and store them for later use, proposes its implementation in isolated rural systems in the Chilean Norte Grande. The new ternary and quaternary Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF), designed with the addition of Ca(NO 3) 2 and LiNO 3 to solar salt, shows a work temperature range of 130 to 600 °C. This temperature range, together with the adequate heat capacity of salt and the potential for storage approximately 175 kWh per day to this system, making it suitable to meet the demands of evaluated areas. The economic viability of these new salts has been analyzed taking into account the sources of nitrates in the country, as well as the cost for storage density offered by these new fluids...|$|R

The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the impact on China's economy of the trade liberalization that is to follow China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The study is conducted within the framework of a 30 -sector, single-country, static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for China. In contrast to existing CGE studies on China's trade liberalization, which typically assume competitive markets, this study takes into account the incomplete formation of the market system, the existence of government intervention and imperfect competition, etc. It also uses more recent data than existing analyses. In particular, the benchmark year is 1998, and the actual schedule of China's trade barrier reductions is used. This study also incorporates more detailed specifications regarding foreign trade intervention, including <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions,</b> non-tariff trade barriers, indirect taxes on foreign trade, tax rebates for exports, etc. Thus, this study tries to obtain a more realistic picture of the influences on the Chinese economy of the anticipated trade liberalization. The simulations of the CGE model provide some positive (rather than normative) conclusions. They predict that, due to the trade liberalization, China's real GDP and total employment will rise by small fractions, while the general price level will decline by a few percentage points. Total import value would rise by more than 10 percent, whereas total export value would rise by less than 10 percent. Therefore, China's trade surplus, though still positive, is likely to decline substantially and China's terms of trade may worsen slightly. On the other hand, China's degree of dependence upon foreign trade, measured by the ratio of foreign trade value to GDP, would rise by a few percentage points. The welfare impact of the predicted changes in the Chinese economy is not clear. Assessing this impact requires making normative judgments based on exogenously imposed criteria. Such an assessment is also {{complicated by the fact that}} China's decision to join the WTO is likely to have been influenced not only by economic, but also by institutional and political considerations. This could be a fruitful area for further research...|$|R

Chapter 1 studies {{a taste for}} quality channel through which a destination 2 ̆ 7 s income per capita causes the variety-quality tradeoff in product exports. I find that, holding market size constant, the elasticity of consumer taste for quality with respect to income per capita determines the differences {{between rich and poor}} countries in productivity thresholds, firm market shares, and number of varieties produced. Using firm-level data, empirical support for the theoretical predictions are found. Conditional on entry, low-quality export sales are decreasing in the destination country 2 ̆ 7 s GDP per capita, while the relationship between high-quality export sales and income per capita exhibits an inverted-U shape. Chapter 2 considers the effects of import tariff reductions on the quality of China 2 ̆ 7 s exports. I focus on a composition effect arising from firm self-selection into the ordinary and the processing trade regimes following tariff reductions and provide an explanation for the over time declining trend of China 2 ̆ 7 s exports quality documented in trade literature. Processing firms produce higher quality goods than ordinary firms due to <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> on the processing activity. A lower import tariff favors ordinary exporting firms in that cheaper imported inputs induce firms to upgrade product quality and compete for larger market shares. Chapter 3 investigates the impacts of rules of origin (ROOs) on FTA utilization rates and on country welfare. I develop a general equilibrium model featuring both variable and fixed costs of complying with ROOs. A binding ROO forces exporters to employ more locally produced inputs instead of using the most efficient manufacturing process. Additionally, firms face fixed documentation costs due to the administrative process of obtaining certificates of origin. Whether firms utilize an FTA depends on the tariff benefits net of the extra costs. I show that: (1) as the ROO becomes stricter, the FTA utilization rate decreases and the dominant extensive margin drives down the wage rate in the downstream country; (2) the welfare effects of ROOs are ambiguous depending on the elasticity of substitution between varieties...|$|R

Notwithstanding data limitations, the key messages from the analysis are as follows. First, {{there is a need for}} a renewed political commitment to regional integration. In addition, key measures for improving compliance with the requirements for a customs union need to be introduced, including limiting <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions,</b> phasing out remaining surcharges, strengthening the determination of products'' country origin, and enhancing customs administration. There is also a need to improve transportation infrastructure and organization. Finally, there is a strong case for tariff reduction, with or without an EPA.

40|$|Border tax {{adjustments}} (BTAs) {{may be able}} {{to alleviate}} concerns of reduced competitiveness for countries introducing environmental taxes and standards, while limiting the risk of companies relocating to developing countries to exploit lax environmental regimes—known as leakage. 1 However, the ability of industrialized nations to offer developing countries special trade privileges for developmental purposes, including border <b>tariff</b> <b>exemptions</b> on exported goods, provides what is referred to in this article as a “leakage loophole. ” This scheme allows relocating companies to produce goods in developing countries at high environmental cost and sell them in the industrialized country they relocated from with no adjustment at the border at a potentially lower cost than domestically produced goods which have internalized their negative environmental externalities. This article considers tax methods that counter the ability of such trade privileges benefitting those wishing to relocate and exploit them as to prevent leakage and ensure any concessions are only available for whom they are intended. In light of current academic debate, this article uses the “best available technology” (BAT) standard to exemplify the potential grounds for adjustment exemption. Further, it considers the uses of border tax adjustments for any legitimate environmental goal, not simply for carbon emissions. This article is divided as follows, with the presumption that this article applies where World Trade Organization (WTO) law is prevalent. Part I provides a background on unilateral environmental objectives. Part II summarizes reasons why nations may take unilateral action for environmental purposes and how it may impact other nations. Part III introduces the concept of border tax adjustments as a potential trade-neutral environmental measure. Part IV identifies that some environmental taxes may aim to alter the production methods used to make a good instead of concentrating solely upon the environmental qualities of the final product. Part V introduces the notion that any tax incentives used to alter production methods could be dependent upon a producer using the BAT. Part VI explains how nations may withhold the introduction of domestic environmental taxes if they believe it would place their industry at a competitive disadvantage internationally. Part VII explains that some developing countries’ exported goods are exempted from border tariffs upon import into industrialized countries as a form of development aid and also attempts to identify the perceived intended beneficiaries of this aid. Part VII also examines how this exemption offers multi-national enterprises the opportunity to register in developing countries in order to exploit the concession, which is in contradiction of the exemption’s intended purpose. Part VIII proposes and critically assesses a number of original solutions to solve this real problem. Finally, this article summarizes and concludes by identifying the most effective solution...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{detailed}} {{cross country}} {{and over time}} data to show that despite various limitations, the QIZs of Jordan and subsequently Egypt, along with certain US FTAs, have contributed significantly {{to an increase in}} participating countries’ shares of exports to the US in the nine most common categories of clothing items for which the effects of <b>tariff</b> and quota <b>exemptions</b> are likely to be strongest. These influences, although perhaps diminishing after a certain period of time, are stronger than those of exchange rate, transport cost and changes in openness over time. What is perhaps most surprising is that these effects are quite clearly discernable even in the case of Jordan despite its lack of relevant raw materials and prior industrial experience. The results also demonstrate the very significant effects exercised by quotas and their phasing out on the changing country shares in US imports of the selected commodities...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. ethanol fuel {{industry}} has experienced preferential treatment from {{federal and state}} governments ever since the Energy Tax Act of 1978 exempted 10 % ethanol/gasoline blend (gasohol) from the federal excise tax. Combined with a 54 ¢/gal ethanol import <b>tariff,</b> this <b>exemption</b> was designed to provide incentives for the establishment and development of a U. S. ethanol industry. Despite these tax exemptions, until recently, the U. S. ethanol fuel industry was unable to expand from a limited regional market. Ethanol was dominated in the market by MTBE (methyl-tertiary-butyl ether). Only after MTBE was found to contaminate groundwater and consequently banned in many states did the demand for ethanol expand nationally. Limit pricing on the part of MTBE refiners is one hypothesis that may explain this lack of ethanol entry into the fuel-additives market. As a test of this hypothesis, a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model of the ethanol fuel market is developed. The results support the hypothesis of limit-pricing behavior on the part of MTBE refiners, and suggest the U. S. corn-based ethanol industry is vulnerable to limit-price competition, which could recur. The dependence of corn-based ethanol price on supply determinants limits U. S. ethanol refiners' ability to price compete with sugar cane-based ethanol refiners. Without federal support, U. S. ethanol refiners may find it difficult to complete with cheaper sugar cane-refined ethanol, chiefly from Brazil. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
