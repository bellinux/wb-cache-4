40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with static frequency changers, using solid-state switching devices, capable of directly (i. e. without an intermediate dc link) converting polyphase ac power of a given frequency to single or polyphase power of a chosen frequency. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part, comprising five chapters, {{is devoted to the}} study of ideal frequency changers operated from ac Sources having zero internal impedance. The second part, comprising two chapters, considers sources with finite internal impedances. Chapter 1 introduces the basic concepts of static frequency conversion, outlines the basic mathematical models representing static frequency changers and defines the output and input performance indicators. Chapter 2 presents a detailed investigation of that class of three-pulse frequency changers which will be studied in the thesis. A large portion of the chapter is devoted to the study of output waveform generation. The mathematical tools of the investigation, existence matrices and modulating functions, are introduced and defined. Analytical expressions for output waveforms corresponding to various practical modulating functions are derived and the related performance indicators are computed. Assuming a given desired output performance, criteria for an optimal modulating function are established. It is proved that only one system can generate an output waveform conforming to the postulated prerequisites. This system is termed the "Unrestricted" Frequency Changer. Expressions for the input current waves are also derived in this chapter and the corresponding input performance indicators are determined. The concept of a new frequency changer having the unique property of providing unity input power factor, regardless of the load, is introduced. This system is termed the "Unity Power Factor" Frequency Changer. In Chapter 3 the previous results are extended to systems having pulse numbers which are integral multiples of three. Chapter 4 is devoted to the study of output voltage control. Three basic methods are analysed and detailed quantitative data for output voltage and input current waves, and the related performance indicators, are presented in graphical form. In Chapter 5 special aspects of static frequency changing are investigated. It is shown that the input displacement factor is variable. The concept of the "Controlled Displacement Factor" Frequency Changer is introduced It is proven that the naturally commutated cycloconvertor is theoretically equivalent to a particular "Controlled Displacement Factor" Frequency Changer. Chapter 6 presents a detailed analysis of the "Unrestricted" Frequency Changer, operated from an ac source with finite internal impedance. The basic conditions are defined and an outline is given of the techniques of symmetrical components used for the analysis. The input current, input terminal voltage and output voltage waveforms are expressed in terms of the input terminal impedance and the positive, negative and zero sequence components of the output currents. The equivalent sequence impedances and the output impedance matrix are derived. The output voltage unbalance is computed under various conditions and presented in graphical form. The relationships between the amplitudes of the unwanted components in the output waveform and the resonant frequency of the input <b>terminal</b> <b>circuit</b> are also graphically presented. The results obtained are verified by computer simulations. In Chapter 7 a similar analysis of the "Unity Power Factor" Frequency Changer is carried out. The computed data are also graphically presented. Again, the results are verified by appropriate computer simulations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{piezoelectric}} thin film actuation of RF MEMS devices. lt is demonstrated that piezoelectric actuation using silicon structures with integrated PZT thin film {{is suitable for}} RF MEMS switches and mechanical filters. Both these devices are studied, fabricated and tested. To assist the mechanical design of a piezoelectric microswitch an electrical model is developed, from which design parameters can be derived to meet the requirement of an insertion loss of - 1 dB and an isolation loss of - 40 dB at 4 GHz. The model shows how the switching gap and the overlapping dimension are two key parameters and the ratio between the two should be larger than 0. 15. Switching gaps are chosen as 5 m and 7. 5 m from the designed range of 3 ~ 15 m. An equivalent circuit network incorporating a transmission line model of the coupling beam is developed to demonstrate a design method for the mechanical filter. The model reveals that the coupling beam stiffness, coupling position, electromechanical coupling factor and the quality factor of the piezoelectric cantilever have substantial effects on filter characteristics. A narrower/wider bandwidth with higher/lower filter Q can result if the coupling position is near/further to a cantilever's anchor position. Extreme situations of the above two coupling cases result in filter bandwidth's disappearing and filter centre frequency's shifting. For a desired filter insertion loss source and load resistances need {{to be determined by}} quality factors of <b>terminal</b> <b>circuit</b> and coupled resonators. A bulk micromachining process compatible with the integration of PZT thin film onto silicon is developed. ln general, for PZT pattern size above 100 m wet etching could give satisfactory pattern definition, however for pattern size below 50 m dry etching is needed. To etch a thickness 2 1 m PZT film long dry etching lime demands for the survivability of a masking material. ln this study a technique combined of dry and wet etching is developed for a 1 m PZT film. lt is found that a low pressure promotes a higher etch rate and the best etching conditions are a gas mixture with a composition of 1 / 4 for CHF 3 /Ar at a total gas flow of 25 sccm under a RF power of 150 W. Dry etching is also developed to release cantilevers from the buried S 102 layer with conditions of a gas mixture of 13 sccm CHF 3 and 3 sccm 02 at 80 mTorr and a RF power of 100 W in 30 mins for 1 m Si 02. To be compatible with PZT elements silicon cantilevers are processed using deep reactive ion etching. PZT thin film actuation has been demonstrated successfully with PZI' thin film integrated silicon cantilevers. A static deflection of 2. 89 m is measured at an actuating voltage of 20 V for a 100 m wide and 450 m long cantilever. A displacement of 556 nm at 12. 98 kHz resonance is measured for a 200 m wide and 850 m long cantilever under a 10 mV AC plus a 10 V DC. A piezoelectric strain constant d 31 of 30. 15 pC/N has been obtained for the PZT thin film used in this study. Filter resonant modes and impedance responses are measured. The filter concept design is justified by the obtained results. Using the impedance data the electromechanical coupling factor, filter centre frequency, filter bandwidth and filter Q are determined. There is a good agreement between the measured and calculated filter centre frequencies. At the first filter resonant mode a maximum piezoelectric coupling factor of 0. 19 and a maximum resonator-Q of 235 are recorded. At the second filter resonant mode a maximum of 0. 12 and a maximum resonator-Q of 360 are obtained. Results show smaller coupling factors than required at the 13 ' and 2 " centre frequencies for all measured filters. This implies that pass bands of designed filters will be missing from their responses at the 18 ' and 2 " centre frequencies. Design improvements are given in the relevant results discussions. Residual stresses are studied for deflected cantilevers after release. The tensile stress of PZT, the converted tensile stress of Pt and the compressive stress of remaining buried SiO 2 layer could result in the upwards-deflected cantilevers. The compressive stress of P could compensate the tensile stress of PZT and flatten the cantilever beam. lf the buried SiO 2 layer is removed incompletely or if the tensile stress of PZT layer is very high, then upwards-deflected cantilevers would result. Measurements of the most switch cantilevers show larger initial deflections than the designed switching gaps. Finally, conclusions and suggestions of future work are given...|$|E
