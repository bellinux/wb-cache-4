50|$|A {{literary}} <b>text</b> is a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> material, {{such as a}} book or poem, {{that has}} the purpose of telling a story or entertaining, as in a fictional novel. Its primary function as a text is usually aesthetic, {{but it may also}} contain political messages or beliefs.American schoolchildren and their parents are taught that literary texts contrast with informational texts that have the purpose of providing information rather than entertainment. Informational texts, such as science briefs and history books, are increasingly receiving emphasis in public school curricula as part of the Common Core State Standards. As a result, many parents have challenged the idea that literary texts are of less pedagogical value than informational ones.|$|R
40|$|Business {{correspondence}} {{and the language}} of administration have become important due to their utility {{within the framework of}} training students specializing in foreign languages. Research into translation, which has traditionally studied the fields of literary and technical translation, will have to face new challenges in this regard. Business correspondence following the tactical objectives of the psychology of persuasion realized in a given language culture makes use of the devices of manipulation feasible in the given language. It is no longer a subjective literary <b>text</b> or a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> aiming to be objective and full of professional items of information that counts but, in our view, the linguistic command of the grammar of persuasion. We think that an approach analysing the functional equivalence of translation theory may provide an answer to the problem...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTraditional {{literary}} criticism overlooked “reader” {{and his role}} in attributing a specific meaning to the text. This issue is important in literary texts as they possess a certain discourse, an exclusive feature of this genre. But act ually a text is written to be read and therefore the reader has {{a vital role in}} completing a text and giving it a new identity through the reading process he experiences. The reader has an active interaction with the written words which ultimately create the literary <b>text.</b> A silent <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> is activated once it is read by a reader. However “reader” is not defined clearly even by the reader-response theorists and it has remained a controversial issue among the diverse theorists of this literary approach. What is more, readers can be categorized depending on who defines them and the role they accept in the reading process which differs from one reader to another. At the same time factors defining a reader vary regarding their exclusive role in completing a literary text. There are even some experts who wish to distinguish a literary critic from a reader; even though they are both readers, yet of different categories...|$|R

5000|$|This estrangement serves {{literature}} by forcing {{the reader to}} think about what might have been an ordinary <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> about a common life experience in a more thoughtful way. A <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in a novel versus a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in a fishing magazine. At the very least, literature should encourage readers to stop and look closer at scenes and happenings they otherwise might have skimmed through uncaring. The reader is not meant to be able to skim through literature. When addressed in a language of estrangement, speech cannot be skimmed through. [...] "In the routines of everyday speech, our perceptions of and responses to reality become stale, blunted, and as the Formalists would say 'automatized'. By forcing us into a dramatic awareness of language, literature refreshes these habitual responses and renders objects more perceptible" [...] (Eagleton 3).|$|R
