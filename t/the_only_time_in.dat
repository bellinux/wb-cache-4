5|$|Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} 2:24:43, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back.

50|$|Historically, most federal {{elections}} {{have already been}} decided {{by the time the}} polls close <b>in</b> Western Australia. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> recent memory where the state has decided an election were 1998, when the first returns from the state assured a second term for John Howard, and 2010, when the victory of a state Nationals candidate who didn't identify with the federal party allowed Julia Gillard to stay in office with a minority government.|$|R
5|$|After taking match {{figures of}} 6/117 and 5/140 for India A against Sri Lanka A, Kartik {{made his first}} {{overseas}} appearance for India, replacing the injured Harbhajan midway through the 2003–04 tour of Australia. He had little success in his first tour match, taking 1/64 and 1/53 against Australian A. He played in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground when India fielded two spinners for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the series. He was punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of1/211 from 45 overs, a run rate of 4.68, in a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|Among Combs' other accomplishments as {{governor}} were requiring voting machines in state elections and {{passage of a}} law making the assessment of state employees for political campaign funds a felony. At {{the end of his}} term, Combs backed Edward T. Breathitt to succeed him {{as governor}}. Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican Louie B. Nunn in the general election. It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century that a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E
5|$|During her tour to Europe, Eva Perón was {{featured}} in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's caption–"Eva Perón: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow"–was {{a reference to the}} name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E

50|$|A stalwart of Birmingham club cricket, Morris {{played in}} {{first-class}} cricket as an amateur, {{and was a}} left-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He played in a single match in 1925, scoring 20 and 27, taking one wicket and two catches. In 1926, he played regularly for Warwickshire in a four-week period {{from the end of}} June, appearing in six games. His greatest personal success came in the match against Glamorgan in which he scored 53 and 76, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> which he exceeded 50 with the bat. He did not appear for the Warwickshire first eleven again after these matches.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} club's {{existence}} they played in local leagues around the Centre-Ouest region. In 1945, after the Second World War, the side joined the Championnat de France amateur. They achieved promotion to Division 3 in 1970 and stayed in the division for the following eight seasons. Between 1980 and 1984, the team played in Division 4 before winning promotion back to Division 3. The club gained professional status {{for the first time}} the following year when they were promoted to Division 2. After another promotion in 1987, they played in Division 1 for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the 1987–88 season, but were relegated after one season.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{changed for}} Barber in the 1932 season, when Yorkshire's regular, long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness. This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack {{believed}} that he thoroughly deserved {{his place in the}} team as he scored exactly 1,000 runs at an average of 25.64, the first time he reached four figures in a season. He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages, {{the first time he had}} been placed so high. His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season. After this breakthrough, Barber steadily improved his total of runs and batting average, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935. In 1933, he scored 1,595 runs at an average of 33.93, and in 1934 he scored 1,927 runs at an average of 40.14. In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages. However, Barber's best season statistically was the following season, 1935, when he achieved his best aggregate of runs and highest average in an English season, passing 2,000 runs in a season for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career. He scored 2,147 runs at an average of 42.09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages. These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career, where he scored 61 and 18 not out.|$|E

5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career that he solely managed a bill.

5|$|On 26 August 1929, {{during the}} 1929 Palestine riots the kibbutz was {{attacked}} by an Arab mob equipped with firearms. The villagers and Arab policemen managed to fend away the rioters. British policemen told the kibbutz to evacuate and promised to take care for their property and the kibbutz left the following day. On 28 August, Arab rioters burned the kibbutz's barn, uprooted trees, stole corn from the fields and vandalized two gravestones in the kibbutz's cemetery. It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> {{the history of the}} kibbutz it was abandoned and during the riots 16 other Jewish communities were evacuated.|$|E
5|$|On Monday Night Football {{against the}} {{defending}} champion Buccaneers, Manning and the Colts trailed 35–14 in the final five minutes. After one short touchdown drive, the Colts recovered the onside kick. Manning threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th & 6 to make it 35–28. With 1:41 remaining, Manning got the ball back and drove the offense 85 yards for the game-tying touchdown. He set up the winning 29-yard field goal in overtime for a stunning 38–35 win. It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> NFL history a team won a game after trailing by 21 points in the final 4 minutes of regulation. Manning passed for 386 yards in the game.|$|E

5|$|Pierce did not temper {{his rhetoric}} {{after losing the}} nomination. In his final message to Congress, {{delivered}} in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He {{took the opportunity to}} defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations. In {{the final days of the}} Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted. It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought.

Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> baseball history that a team has {{come back from a}} 0–3 deficit to win a series.

5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1893 and joined the Football League in 1920.

Twice in the late 1980s they came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in 1993 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference. Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the English football league system for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in 2002–03.|$|E
