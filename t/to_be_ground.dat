25|$|It is {{impossible}} to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over {{the lives of many}} people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated bobbin winder, the rolling mill, the machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and the lens-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground.</b> A single action rotates both surfaces at a fixed speed ratio determined by the gear.|$|E
25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes {{take place in the}} grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.|$|E
25|$|Thirlage was the {{feudal law}} {{by which the}} laird could force all those farmers living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground.</b> Additionally they had to carry out repairs on the mill, {{maintain}} the lade and weir, as well as conveying new millstones to the site. The Thirlage Law was repealed in 1779 and after this many mills fell out of use as competition and unsubsidised running costs took their toll. This may explain why {{no sign of the}} mill is visible on Thomson's 1828 map, Aitken's 1829 map, or the 1858 OS map. Other mills, such as Dalgarven Mill near Kilwinning, survived almost to the present day through a mixture of luck, a reliable water supply and investment at the right time. Dalgarven Mill is now a museum. The last unrestored working mill in Ayrshire was Coldstream near Beith which last worked in 1979; the last traditional Ayrshire miller being Andrew Smith.|$|E

25|$|Not {{all that}} remains is bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and {{surgical}} implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants {{do not have to}} be removed before cremation. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground).</b> Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.|$|E
25|$|The oases to {{the west}} and north of the range have the easiest access. Where {{mosquitoes}} do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar, where indigenous plant species have largely been replaced by some 56,000 date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) for the production of dates. These are harvested between late July and early August. In winter, when reserves are depleted, {{it is not uncommon for}} the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into a paste and consumed. These palm groves can also grow millet and corn, but the crop is spotty and sometimes swept away by early flooding. The banks of the enneris grow desert gourd (Citrullus colocynthis), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make flour. Horticulture is practiced on a small scale using traditional irrigation methods. Goats and, more rarely, sheep number 50,000 heads, and 8,000 camels and 7,000 donkeys are raised in the range. Chickens are also numerous, although the consumption of meat is rare, usually done so through salting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} barnacles {{can be traced}} back to animals such as Priscansermarinus from the Middle Cambrian (on the order of [...] ), although they do not become common as skeletal remains in the fossil record until the Neogene (last 20 million years).

2500|$|Andrew Culbertson {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{settlers}} to have success in the Duboistown area. He purchased several tracts of land beginning in 1773, including the parcel owned by Samuel Boone, near the mouth of Mosquito Run. Culbertson is thought to have moved into the by crossing an Indian Trail over White Deer Mountain that is now known as Culbertson's Path. He built a sawmill on the mouth of the creek so after moving to the area and there he lived for several years. Culbertson was forced to flee the area during the American Revolutionary War, when settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the [...] "Big Runaway" [...] occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the [...] "Little Runaway". Culbertson returned to the area and rebuilt his sawmill. He also built a gristmill, distillery, and a press that extracted nut and linseed oils. His gristmill was especially important to the development of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. It was easily accessible by canoe. Farmers could float their grain in their canoes or other watercraft right up to the mill. Other farmers from the surrounding valleys reached his mill via Culbertonson's Path. Culbertson saw another business opportunity with the farmers who were coming to his mill. He quickly built a tavern in which the weary farmers could enjoy a drink and get some food while they waited for their grain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> into flour. This tavern became a popular destination for the young people of the West Branch Valley. Today Culbertson's Mill and tavern are long gone, and the area is a largely overgrown riverbank with an abandoned softball field surrounded by a railroad, bridge, and woods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plague of}} locusts in [...] finds {{parallels}} in several ancient texts, often involving {{the actions of}} gods. [...] The ancient Sumerian tale The Disputation Between the Hoe and the Plow relates the acts of the god Enlil’s hand and the locust swarm. Similarly, an Ugaritic poem about the goddess Anat circa 1450–1200 BCE related how Anat did battle, leaving corpses like locusts. In a New Kingdom Egyptian letter, one scribe chided another for leaving scribal work to labor in agriculture, where “The mice abound in the field, the locust descends, the cattle devour.” An Akkadian prophecy foretold that locusts would arise and devour the land. The 754 BCE treaty between Ashur-nirari V of Assyria and Mati'ilu of Arpad, Syria, provided that if Mati'ilu violated the treaty, “May locusts appear and devour his land.” Similarly, the treaty between Ktk and Arpad struck at about 750 BCE provided: “If Matti’el is false to Barga’yah and to his son and to his offspring [...] [...] [...] May Hadad pour out everything evil on earth and in heaven, and every trouble. [...] And may he pour out hailstones upon Arpad. [...] Seven years shall the locust eat. [...] Seven years shall the worm eat. [...] Seven years shall blight come upon the face of its land, and no grass shall sprout, so that nothing green can be seen and its vegetation does not appear.” And the Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon, who ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire 681–669 BCE, threatened the vassal who breached the treaty with these threats: “May Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, {{put an end to}} vegetation in your land, may he avoid your meadows and hit your land with a severe destructive downpour, may locusts, which diminish the produce of the land, devour your crops, let there be no sound of the grinding stone or the oven in your houses, let barley rations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> disappear for you, so that they grind your bones, (the bones of) your sons and daughters instead of barley rations, and not even the (first) joint of your finger should be able to dip into the dough, may the [...] [...] [...] eat the dough from your troughs[...] [...] [...] May they (the gods) let lice, caterpillars, and other field pests eat up your land and your district as if locusts.” An Assyrian blessing wished: “The evil locust which ravages the grain, the malignant grasshopper which dries up the orchards, which would cut off the regular offerings of god and goddess, — Enlil listens to you, Tutu obeys you — may it (the grasshopper) be counted as nought!” ...|$|E
