5|$|Cott {{describes}} markings <b>that</b> <b>help</b> {{to deflect}} attack, {{such as the}} eyespots of butterfly wings and the twitching cast-off tails of lizards, both acknowledged to Poulton, {{as well as the}} distraction displays of birds such as the partridge mentioned by Gilbert White in his Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne.|$|E
5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties <b>that</b> <b>help</b> to deter predator attacks.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes are protein {{complexes}} which degrade unneeded {{or damaged}} proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Enzymes <b>that</b> <b>help</b> such reactions are called proteases.|$|E

There are two ADIR's {{and they are}} made of high-purity aluminum. There is a special black coating on the radiators <b>that</b> <b>helps</b> them emit heat into space.|$|R
5|$|The Galloway is {{naturally}} hornless, {{and instead of}} horns has a bone knob {{at the top of}} its skull called the poll. This breed's shaggy coat has both a thick, woolly undercoat for warmth and stiffer guard hairs <b>that</b> <b>help</b> shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena vitilis contain the {{chlorinated}} compound strobilurinB. Strobilurins are aromatic compounds produced by some fungi <b>that</b> <b>help</b> them secure resources {{by giving them}} an advantage against other competing fungi. They have been investigated for potential use as lead compounds for agricultural fungicides.|$|E
5|$|The spore sac {{contains}} the gleba, which {{is composed of}} a pseudocolumella, unbranched threads (the capillitium), the spore-bearing cells (basidia) and the spores themselves; all of these microscopic elements have certain characteristic features <b>that</b> <b>help</b> distinguish G.triplex from other superficially similar earthstars.|$|E

5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins <b>that</b> <b>help</b> lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers <b>that</b> <b>help</b> never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors <b>that</b> <b>help</b> {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae <b>that</b> <b>help</b> to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Appearing as the player's tutors in {{the game}} are the sentient twin witch doctor masks Aku Aku and Uka Uka, both of whom give hints <b>that</b> <b>help</b> the player develop their racing skills. They double as {{obtainable}} power-ups during the races, temporarily protecting the player from all attacks and obstacles while increasing the kart's speed. However, their power does not protect the player from chasms or deep water.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains <b>that</b> <b>help</b> passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E

5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, <b>that</b> <b>help</b> them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, <b>that</b> <b>help</b> to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E

This effort was expanded when Georgia Tech, the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick partnered in June 2010 {{to create a}} joint translational research institute. GTRI has several field offices <b>that</b> <b>help</b> with nearby on-site research and needs. These are in Dallas, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, Shalimar, Florida (near Eglin Air Force Base), Huntsville, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida, Orlando, Florida, Panama City, Florida, Quantico, Virginia, San Diego, California, Tucson, Arizona, Warner Robins, Georgia (near Robins Air Force Base), and Arlington, Virginia/Washington, DC.|$|E

5|$|Image {{provided}} David Brothers {{to serve}} as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses <b>that</b> <b>help</b> the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define lemur taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions <b>that</b> <b>help</b> exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights <b>that</b> <b>help</b> solve the team's case.|$|E
