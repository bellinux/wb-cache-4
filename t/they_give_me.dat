500|$|By 1989, Sims's {{popularity}} was at {{an all-time}} high, and he told the Associated Press, [...] "I can't fulfill all the work <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I can't walk {{out on the street}} without somebody showing me a time step." [...] Tap dancing's popularity was nearing a new peak as well, with three major American cities (Houston, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Washington, D.C.) hosting tap-dance festivals. In movie theaters, the dance drama Tap was introducing Sims's footwork (and that of his former student Gregory Hines) to audiences who had never had the opportunity to see him perform before.|$|E

Felton worked on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix throughout 2006. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflected: [...] "I have had input into Draco. If <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a line and I do not think it is something he would say, I suggest changing it. They do listen to you and you do feel a part of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Youell was in {{the police}} car, he asked Tillman Johnson, [...] "Mr. Johnson, {{what do you think}} they'll do to me for this? Will <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the chair?" [...] Johnson responded with, [...] "You won't get much. Maybe five or ten years. They don't give you the {{electric}} chair for stealing cars." [...] Swinney then said, [...] "Mr. Johnson, you got me for more than stealing cars." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Gregory Peck, [...] "I {{admit that}} I was not terribly {{happy with the}} script <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me,</b> or with the {{production}} <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> which was mostly on the back lot of Universal. I thought they shortchanged the production." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy {{in all of}} the Harry Potter films. Prior to landing {{the part}} of Malfoy, Felton auditioned to play Harry and Ron. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflects: [...] "I have had input into Draco.

2500|$|In early September 1989, a {{collection}} of Powell's speeches on Europe was published titled Enoch Powell on 1992 (1992 being the year set {{for the creation of}} the Single Market by the Single European Act of 1986). In a speech at Chatham House for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom. At the Conservative Party conference in October, he told a fringe meeting, [...] "I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years". After Thatcher resisted further European integration at a meeting at Strasbourg in November Powell asked her parliamentary private secretary Mark Lennox-Boyd to pass to her [...] "my respectful congratulations on her stand... she both spoke for Britain and gave a lead to Europeâ€”in the line of succession of Winston Churchill and William Pitt. Those who lead are always out in front, alone". Thatcher replied, [...] "I am deeply touched by your words. <b>They</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the greatest possible encouragement".|$|E
2500|$|The tarsier, {{especially}} if it's a male, {{is also a}} territorial creature. A male would attack any young tarsier venturing into its territory and kill it with a fierce bite. [...] "That's why when there's a newborn, we try {{to check on the}} position [...] three times a day," [...] he said, adding that the male tarsier's murderous disposition precluded keeping it in a small, enclosed space. The creatures seem to have a good memory, too. [...] "Because whenever there are guests, that's when their eyes stay wide open. If it's just me around, <b>they</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a brief look and go back to sleep," [...] he said. The tarsier mainly dines on insects, usually crickets, and frogs. Its chief predator, on the other hand, is the common house cat. The estimated 100 tarsiers in the PTFI sanctuary can climb over the surrounding seven-foot-high net fence to hunt elsewhere at night. But they almost always return before daybreak. The fence is actually more for keeping the cats out and the insects in, Pizarras explained. Thus, he and two other staff members have made it their daily morning routine to inspect the net for breaches. At night, with the help of strong fog lights, flying insects from neighboring hills are drawn to the sanctuary, providing the tarsiers a steady menu.|$|E

5000|$|Ever {{grateful}} for his success, Hedges, {{a man of}} humility, expressed his appreciation for the Caddo Parish School Board: [...] "They <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> {{the opportunity to be}} a head coach at a young age. After leaving the parish, I came back and <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> another head coaching job. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a lot of opportunities and I appreciate it very much." ...|$|R
