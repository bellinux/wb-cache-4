25|$|Mk. VIII was {{designed}} to work with IFF Mk. III, a transponder system that listened for pulses between 160MHz and 190MHz and responded with longer pulses on a slightly different frequency. Since the magnetron operated at 3.3GHz, it would not trigger the IFF system, so a second pulsed <b>transmitter</b> <b>system</b> had {{to be used in}} the fighters to support this, the interrogator (or interrogator/responder), code named Lucero.|$|E
25|$|The <b>transmitter</b> <b>system</b> on the Mk. I {{produced}} 3microsecond (µs) long pulses {{with up to}} 50kW {{of power}} 1,500 times a second. These were broadcast semi-directionally, floodlighting the entire area {{in front of the}} transmitter antenna's current bearing. Since the signal was even less directional vertically than horizontally, a significant amount of the signal hit the ground. Due to the long wavelengths used, this signal was strongly reflected forward, and due to geometrical considerations, any signal hitting the ground near the station would reflect with enough of a vertical angle to mix with the main signal in the area of interest (about 30km around the station). This was the purpose of the GL mat, which did not eliminate the reflections, but made them much more predictable.|$|E
25|$|The DRS {{undertook}} {{terrestrial broadcasting}} for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, {{it did not}} provide for small towns where the TV set density was {{higher than in the}} villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a low-power limited rebroadcast (LRB) TV <b>transmitter</b> <b>system</b> was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5m chicken-mesh parabolic antenna with a low-noise block converter, that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, Sambalpur in Orissa (75 villages) and Muzaffarpur in Bihar (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade-off between DRS and LRB. However, due to financial constraints, these two LRBs had to be shelved, and instead an LRB was set up at SHAR, Sriharikota.|$|E
40|$|Equivalent dipole polarizabilities are a succinct way to {{summarize}} the inductive response of an isolated conductive body at distances greater than {{the scale of the}} body. At any time lag or frequency, an equivalent dipole polarizability response is comprised of 9 parameters; six specifying an equivalent dipole polarizability matrix (which is symmetric) and three specifying the apparent location of the body center. Smith and Morrison (2002) give equations for calculating uncertainties in equivalent dipole polarizability and position based on analysis of an iterative linearized inversion. Here, the root mean squared uncertainty in polarizability is weighted and summed over a number of control points and minimized using an evolutionary algorithm for a number of instrument designs. Three families of designs are presented: single <b>transmitter</b> <b>systems</b> for use on a 2 -D grid of positions with negligible error in relative instrument location, two <b>transmitter</b> <b>systems</b> for use on a line of positions with negligible error in relative instrument location, and three <b>transmitter</b> <b>systems</b> for stand alone use.
