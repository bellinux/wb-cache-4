40|$|The {{historical}} Green Vault, one of Europe's most sumptuous treasure chambers, has reopened in September 2006 in the Dresden Royal Palace. For the baroque {{presentation of}} the artworks the special properties of <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> mirrors are of great importance. A comprehensive analytic characterisation was necessary for restoration and reconstruction. The different original casting glasses were analysed in respect of chemical composition, roughness, waviness and optical properties like chromaticity coordinates and transmittance. The microstructure of the <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> layers were investigated on metallographic cross-sections and by X-ray diffraction. The investigations reveal that the <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> layers are composed of ?-HgSn 6 - 10 phase with a grain size between 5 and 50 ?m surrounded by a thin mercury phase with about 2 wt. ?% tin. However the most important property of the baroque <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> mirrors is a relative low reflectivity of about 59 % which is drastically lower than for silver mirrors with a reflectivity of about 96 %. According to the characterisation results a suitable glass for reconstruction was selected. The mirror layers were produced by historical <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> technology for the rooms not destroyed by bombarding of Dresden in February 1945. For the completely destroyed Jewel Room pure tin layers were deposited by magnetron sputtering. The results show that this new technology enables an adequate substitute for the original <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> layers...|$|E
50|$|The pottery {{are made}} with locally {{available}} fine textured clay. The clay mould are prepared in different shapes and are backed in kiln. Later these clay wares are washed with powdered vegetable matter and are rubbed with mustard oil. They are decorated with floral and geometric patterned grooves using sharp twigs. They are smoke fired with rice husk in enclosed kiln which gives its unique shiny black surface. They are again rubbed with oil and baked in kiln. The grooves on clay wares are then filled with silvery powder of Zinc and Mercury, washed with water and polished again. Lead or <b>Tin</b> <b>Amalgams</b> are also used. The silver powder gives shiny hue against black background of clay. Sometimes they are coated with lacquer whrn they are still hot to give them shine.|$|R
5000|$|According to American Civil War-era dental {{handbooks}} {{from the}} mid-19th century, {{since the early}} 19th century metallic fillings had been used, made of lead, gold, tin, platinum, silver, aluminum, or amalgam. A pellet was rolled slightly larger than the cavity, condensed into place with instruments, then shaped and polished in the patient's mouth. The filling was usually left [...] "high", with final condensation — [...] "tamping down" [...] — occurring while the patient chewed food. Gold foil {{was the most popular}} and preferred filling material during the Civil War. <b>Tin</b> and <b>amalgam</b> were also popular due to lower cost, but were held in lower regard.|$|R
5000|$|Dentistry {{has used}} alloys of mercury with metals such as silver, copper, indium, <b>tin</b> and zinc. <b>Amalgam</b> is an [...] "excellent and {{versatile}} restorative material" [...] {{and is used}} in dentistry {{for a number of}} reasons. It is inexpensive and relatively easy to use and manipulate during placement; it remains soft for a short time so it can be packed to fill any irregular volume, and then forms a hard compound. Amalgam possesses greater longevity when compared to other direct restorative materials, such as composite. However, this difference has decreased with continual development of composite resins.|$|R

For this purpose some specimens of <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> mirrors have been created, characterized and then subjected to artificial aging. The monitoring of the degradation was done by different techniques such as XRD, SEM and UV-VIS Reflectance Spectroscopy. They allowed to evaluate the progressive color and morphology changes of the amalgam layer, but no expected degradation compounds of amalgam, such as cassiterite and romarkite, were detected. The possible mechanisms underlying the experimental results and further experimental procedures and tools are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{some of the}} materials and methods proposed {{for the restoration of}} amalgam mirrors. The amalgam mirror is the first glass mirrors, where the reflective layer is represented in a layer of mercury and tin amalgamation, formed on a flat glass surface. This layer may reach a severe status of damage which makes it difficult to prevent the change taking place therein, or prevent its continuation and spread. Three different methods of partial and total replacement of corroded/missing areas were investigated to treat and prevent the further destruction of these mirrors. Modern <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> mirror samples were prepared according to the historic manufacturing technique then subjected to artificial aging. The suggested methods of partial replacement were applied onto the samples then subjected again to artificial aging. The performance of these innovative methods was evaluated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the Reflectance spectroscopy (RS) ...|$|E
40|$|An amalgam {{mirror is}} a mirror type, used from the 15 th century {{until the end}} of the 19 th century, where the {{reflective}} layer is constituted by a <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> layer adhered to a glass sheet. In this work two amalgam mirrors samples were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer and by micro-X-ray Fluorescence elemental mapping to go deeply into the understanding of the degradation mechanism of the amalgam layer of ancient mirrors. The investigation has been focused for the first time on the reflective surface of the amalgam layer adherent to the glass sheet to better understand the processes of amalgam corrosion. The two amalgam degradation compounds romarchite and cassiterite has been spatially differentiated by SEM and EDS maps. SEM images and μ-XRF and EDS maps showed that the amalgam degradation products grow up to form hemispherical stratified calottes. This structure is probably due to a mechanism involves cyclic phases and oxygen radial diffusion from a superficial oxidation nucleu...|$|E
40|$|The tin inlay of a {{piece of}} {{furniture}} designed by Hendrik Van Soest has been investigated for its composition, microstructure and corrosion. Small samples were removed and investigated with optical microscopy, micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray detection and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction. The results show that the inlay is composed of a binary alloy consisting of tin and mercury. The composition suggests the use of an amalgam to produce the metal inlay. However, the microstructure of the inlayed fillets proves that tin sheet was used instead of a <b>tin</b> mercury <b>amalgam.</b> Corrosion of the tin inlay is the most important sign of deterioration. Analyses show the presence of a thin layer of tin oxide chloride hydroxide in direct contact with the metal. This layer is covered by a layer of the more common tin corrosion compounds romarchite and cassiterite. The harmful effect of chloride containing compound is shown by the advanced corrosion. For future preservation of the tin inlay this compound must be either removed or be immobilized...|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{has been}} smelted from {{cinnabar}} {{for thousands of}} years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and <b>tin,</b> to form <b>amalgams</b> (an alloy in a soft paste or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for gilding objects such as armor and mirrors with precious metals. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind. Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.|$|R
40|$|Dental amalgam {{has been}} the most useful {{restorative}} material in dentistry for more than 150 year. Widely pure and applied scientific study has been done in filed of determining amalgam`s phases and composition, mechanical and corrosion properties of amalgam alloy. But there are very few reports in quantitative analysis of metals content of powder alloy. The works which have been done is mainly on used amalgam alloy or quantitative analysis of removal metals from the alloy. In this study, determination of silver, copper and tin, as basic components of powder alloy, by three; gravimetric, atomic absorption spectroscopy and Inductive Coupled Plasma atomic spectroscopy (ICP), methods and their precision are studied. The simultaneous solution of the three metals required for AA and ICP methods, is also studied. The statistics is done on basis of ASTM standard methods. As the conclusion, the ICP method for quantitative analysis of silver, copper and <b>tin</b> in powder <b>amalgam</b> alloy with composition 4 : 2. 8 : 3, respectively, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{case studies}} that illustrate {{the usefulness of}} X-ray diffraction {{in the field of}} conservation science and archaeometry. X-ray diffraction was instrumental in discovering new pigments such as a yellow lead silicate sulfate chloride of the ellestadite group found on fresco fragments from an Abbasid structure built in the early eight century A. D. in Jordan; the yellow compound pararealgar (As 4 S 4), which was identified {{for the first time in}} a painting; and magnesium cobalt arsenate, a violet pigment found in numerous paintings. X-ray diffraction also helped answer questions related to degradation processes: crystals forming on artifacts in a Canadian museum were identified as cyclohexylamine hydrochloride (C 6 H 13 NAHCl). This finding was key in tracing the source of the problem back to vapour phase corrosion inhibitors used in the museum’s steam humidification system. Badly corroded metal fillets on a Boulle clock proved to be made of <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam,</b> which is susceptible to galvanic corrosion, instead of the more stable pewter. X-ray diffraction analysis of multi-layer samples is also discussed in relation with the later case study and with the study of paint samples taken from polychrome elements of the sculpted décor of the Ursulines chapel, Québec City...|$|E
40|$|Ancient mirrors were {{constituted}} by a tin-mercury amalgam layer superimposed to a glass sheet. This {{was the only}} one method used until the nineteenth century, when the wet silvering process was invented. The <b>tin</b> <b>amalgam</b> is a binary alloy of tin and mercury {{constituted by}} two different phases: a mercury-rich liquid phase and a tin-rich solid phase. The amalgam alteration produces mercury loss and a general growth of the solid crystalline phase. In addition, tin dioxide and monoxide are formed with a consequent decrease of the amalgam adhesion to the glass. These degradation phenomena led to reduction or disappearance of the mirror reflective power. The aim of this study was the characterization of the amalgam layers of eight mirror samples dating during the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and by a Scanning Electron Microscope with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS), {{and for the first time}} on this type of alloy by X-ray Fluorescence and EPMA-WDS (Electron Probe Micro Analysis with Wavelength Dispersive Spectrometry) elemental mapping. The contents of tin, mercury, and some trace elements in the amalgam layers have been determined. The investigation of the superficial patterns of the amalgam by SEM, EPMA-WDS mapping, and SEM-EDS allowed a first understanding of some morphologies and processes of the degradation of the amalgam layer...|$|E
