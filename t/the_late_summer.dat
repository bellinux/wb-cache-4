5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually.

The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
