5|$|The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an {{elevation}} of , is dominated by māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found on <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up on <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Uhud. A small faction was cut off {{and tried to make}} its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E
5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E

50|$|Graphically, the APL curve can {{be derived}} from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that {{intersect}} (cut) the total product curve. <b>The</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secant line equals the average product <b>of</b> labor, where <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> = dQ/dL. <b>The</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. <b>The</b> <b>slope</b> increases until <b>the</b> line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MPL (which is <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total product curve) equals <b>the</b> APL (<b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secant). Beyond this point <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secants become progressively smaller as APL declines. The MPL curve intersects the APL curve from above at the maximum point of the APL curve. Thereafter, the MPL curve is below the APL curve.|$|R

The grotto of Seokguram and the temple of Bulguksa were the first Korean sites to be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995. In addition, the ruins of the old Hwangnyongsa temple, said to have been Korean's largest, are preserved on <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> Toham Mountain.

5|$|The site of {{the citadel}} may have been {{occupied}} {{as early as the}} Neolithic period, as pottery fragments possibly dating to that period have been found on <b>the</b> <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the mound. Clear evidence for occupation comes from the Chalcolithic period, with sherds resembling pottery of the Ubaid and Uruk periods in the Jazira and southeastern Turkey, respectively.
