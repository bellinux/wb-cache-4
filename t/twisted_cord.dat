2500|$|Silk strings {{are made}} by {{gathering}} a prescribed number of strands of silk thread, then twisting them tightly together. The <b>twisted</b> <b>cord</b> of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid composed of a special mixture of natural glue that binds the strands together. The strings is taken out and left to dry, before being cut into the appropriate length. The top thicker strings (i.e. strings one to four) are further wrapped in a thin silk thread, coiled around the core to make it smoother. According to ancient manuals, there are three distinctive gauges of thickness that one can make the strings. The first is taigu [...] which is the standard gauge, the zhongqing [...] is thinner, whilst the jiazhong [...] is thicker. According to the Yugu Zhai Qinpu, zhongqing is the best. The currently used silk string gauge standard was defined by Suzhou silk string maker Pan Guohui (潘國輝).|$|E
2500|$|The {{full dress}} or scarlet gown differs for each doctorate, but {{uses the same}} {{material}} and colours as the hood. For PhDs, there are {{two versions of the}} scarlet gown. The traditional version {{is the same as the}} MA gown (in theory, though not in practice, the silk version), with the addition of a broad red cloth stripe down each side at the front. [...] The alternative version (authorised in 2006 but commonly used without authorisation before then) uses detachable facings on an undress PhD gown, which is distinguished from the MA gown by doctors' lace on the sleeves that is not found on the traditional festal PhD gown. For the higher doctorates, such as LLD or ScD, the scarlet gown is a more impressive affair, being brightly coloured and voluminous, with open sleeves that hang long at the back, at the sleeve front, the lining is turned outwards and is fixed in position by a <b>twisted</b> <b>cord</b> and button. The linings of the sleeves and the facings are in silk of the colour of the hood lining.|$|E
2500|$|To string a qin, one {{traditionally}} had {{to tie a}} fly's head knot (yingtou jie) {{at one end of}} the string, {{and slip}} the string through the <b>twisted</b> <b>cord</b> (rongkou) which goes into holes at the head of the qin and then out the bottom through the tuning pegs (zhen). The string is dragged over the bridge (yueshan 『岳山』), across the surface board, over the nut (longyin dragon gums) to the back of the qin, where the end is wrapped around one of two legs (fengzu [...] "phoenix feet" [...] or yanzu [...] "geese feet"). Afterwards, the strings are fine tuned using the tuning pegs (sometimes, rosin is used on the part of the tuning peg that touches the qin body to stop it from slipping, especially if the qin is tuned to higher pitches). The most common tuning, [...] "zheng diao" [...] 〈正調〉, is pentatonic: 5 6 1 2 3 5 6 (which can be also played as 1 2 4 5 6 1 2) in the traditional Chinese number system or jianpu (i.e. 1=do, 2=re, etc.). Today this is generally interpreted to mean C D F G A c d, but this should be considered sol la do re mi sol la, since historically the qin was not tuned to absolute pitch. Other tunings are achieved by adjusting the tension of the strings using the tuning pegs at the head end. Thus manjiao diao ("slackened third string") gives 1 2 3 5 6 1 2 and ruibin diao ("raised fifth string") gives 1 2 4 5 7 1 2, which is transposed to 2 3 5 6 1 2 3.|$|E

40|$|We studied neural {{correlates}} {{accompanying the}} Fraser spiral illusion. The Fraser spiral illusion consists of <b>twisted</b> <b>cords</b> superimposed on a patchwork background arranged in concentric circles, which is typically {{perceived as a}} spiral. We tested four displays: the Fraser spiral illusion and three variants derived from it by orthogonally combining featural properties. In our stimuli, {{the shape of the}} cords comprised either concentric circles or a single spiral. The cords themselves consisted of black and white lines in parallel to the contour of the cords (i. e. parallel cords), or oblique line elements (i. e. <b>twisted</b> <b>cords).</b> The displays with <b>twisted</b> <b>cords</b> successfully induced illusory percepts, i. e. circles looked like spirals (the Fraser spiral illusion) and spirals looked like circles (i. e., a ‘reverse Fraser illusion’). We compared the event-related potentials in a Stimulus (Circle, Spiral) × Percept (Circle, Spiral) design. A significant main effect of Stimulus was found at the posterior scalp in an early component (P 220 - 280) and a significant main effect of Percept was found over the anterior scalp in a later component (P 350 - 450). Although the EEG data suggest stimulus-based processing in posterior area in an early time window and Percept based processing in the later time window, an overall clear-cut stimulus-percept segregation was not found due to additional interaction effects. Instead, the data, especially in the later time window in the anterior area, point at differential processing for the condition comprising circle shapes but spiral percepts (i. e. the Fraser illusion) ...|$|R

60|$|Another {{very simple}} form of ornamentation, reappearing {{everywhere}} {{all the world}} over on primitive bowls and vases, is the rope pattern, a line or string-course over the whole surface or {{near the mouth of}} the vessel. Many of the indented patterns on early British pottery have been produced, as Sir Daniel Wilson has pointed out, by the close impress of <b>twisted</b> <b>cord</b> on the wet clay. Sometimes these cords seem to have been originally left on the clay in the process of baking, and used as a mould; at other times they may have been employed afterwards as handles, as is still done in the case of some South African pots: and, when the rope handle wore off, the pattern made by its indentation on the plastic material before sun-baking would still remain as pure ornament. Probably the very common idea of string-course ornamentation just below the mouth or top of vases and bowls has its origin in this early and almost universal practice.|$|E
60|$|In one of {{the most}} secluded {{portions}} of the valley, within a stone’s cast of Fayaway’s lake—for so I christened the scene of our island yachting—and hard by a growth of palms, which stood ranged in order along both banks of the stream, waving their green arms as if to do honour to its passage, was the mausoleum of a deceased warrior-chief. Like all the other edifices of any note, it was raised upon a small pi-pi of stones, which, being of unusual height, was a conspicuous object from a distance. A light thatching of bleached palmetto-leaves hung over it like a self-supported canopy; for it was not until you came very near that you saw it was supported by four slender columns of bamboo, rising at each corner to a little more than the height of a man. A clear area of a few yards surrounded the pi-pi, and was enclosed by four trunks of cocoa-nut trees, resting at the angles on massive blocks of stone. The place was sacred. The sign of the inscrutable Taboo was seen, {{in the shape of a}} mystic roll of white tappa, suspended by a <b>twisted</b> <b>cord</b> of the same material from the top of a slight pole planted within the enclosure.(3) The sanctity of the spot appeared never to have been violated. The stillness of the grave was there, and the calm solitude around was beautiful and touching. The soft shadows of those lofty palm trees—I can see them now—hanging over the little temple, as if to keep out the intrusive sun.|$|E
