5000|$|Rod Trongard's {{voice was}} {{featured}} on <b>the</b> <b>AWA's</b> weekly ESPN broadcasts, reaching millions of homes around the world. His signature phrase was [...] "From coast to coast, continent to continent, and border to border". During broadcasts, he often included city {{names in the}} phrase, signifying the broad reach of wrestling and <b>the</b> <b>AWA's</b> broadcasts at <b>the</b> time. Trongard called matches alongside fellow commentators Lord James Blears and Lee Marshall. Ralph Strangis' earliest national exposure was as play-by-play man and ring announcer for the American Wrestling Association on ESPN, where he worked alongside Lee Marshall, and later Eric Bischoff, in {{the waning days of}} that promotion.|$|R
5|$|In the WWF/WWE, Michaels headlined major {{pay-per-view}} events between 1989 and 2010, {{closing the}} company's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, five times. He was the co-founder and original {{leader of the}} successful stable, D-Generation X. Michaels also wrestled in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he founded The Midnight Rockers with Marty Jannetty in 1985. After winning <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Tag Team Championship twice, the team continued to the WWF as The Rockers and had a high-profile breakup in January 1992. Within the year, Michaels would twice challenge for the WWF Championship and win his first Intercontinental Championship, heralding his arrival {{as one of the}} industry's premier singles stars.|$|E

During the match, LeDuc revealed that his reconciliation with Lawler was a setup, as LeDuc and Hart turned on Lawler by walking away to leave Lawler by himself. As a result, the tag team title was vacated and the feud was rekindled.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Tower in Sydney.|$|E

50|$|In Olympic {{and amateur}} wrestling {{there exists a}} move called a souplex, {{pronounced}} suplay, a Greco-Roman wrestling term derived from French. During his career, pro wrestling commentator Gordon Solie used the soo-PLAY pronunciation (as have <b>the</b> <b>AWA's</b> Rod Trongard and Terry Taylor), but almost all other pro wrestling talent pronounces it SOO-plex.|$|R
5|$|LeDuc {{made his}} AWA {{television}} debut on August 2, 1975 defeating Angel Rivera. LeDuc was given wins over Buddy Wolff and Boris Breznikoff (Nicolai Volkoff) before forming {{the team with}} Larry Hennig. Leduc and Hennig first teamed on September 12, 1975 in Denver, Colorado losing to Jimmy and Johnny Valiant. Leduc and Hennig feuded with the Valiant Brothers for several months before entering a feud with Baron Von Raschke and Mad Dog Vachon. Jos and Larry also received a few title shots against AWA tag champs Blackjack Lanza and Bobby Duncum in August 1976. Probably his most memorable accomplishment while working for the promotion was a bus-pulling stunt filmed in Minneapolis that was also used in promo videos while appearing in the Memphis and Atlanta territories, among others. LeDuc departed <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> in September 1976.|$|E
5|$|Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had {{to contend}} with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which {{consisted}} of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in <b>the</b> <b>AWA.</b> The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 2005, Knox {{appeared}} at a New England Championship Wrestling (NECW) event in Framingham, Massachusetts, where she competed in a four-way match that was won by Violet Flame. Later that month, Knox participated in All Pro Wrestling (APW)'s third ChickFight tournament in Hayward, California, {{in which she}} defeated Morgan {{in the first round}} on 28 October, but lost to eventual winner Mariko Yoshida in the second round later that night. The following night, she teamed with Cheerleader Melissa and Tiffany in a losing effort to Rain, Morgan and Hailey Hatred in a six-woman tag team match at an APW show. She also appeared for <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Pinnacle promotion on 21 January and 26 February 2006, with the first being when she acted as the referee in a match between Caden Matthews and Christopher Ryseck, helping Ryseck to win by hitting Matthews with a chair. On 26 February, she and Ryseck were defeated by Matthews in a handicap match in Pacific, Washington.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the All-Star Wrestling {{television}} series {{was essentially a}} one-hour paid advertisement for <b>the</b> <b>AWA's</b> house shows.

In the early 1970s, as wrestling became more popular, national companies such as McDonald's and local companies such as car dealerships bought commercial spots on the shows.|$|R

5|$|After {{dropping}} <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Southern Tag Team Championship for a {{third and}} final time, the Blond Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win the belts on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained the belts in a rematch against The Jet Set but later dropped them to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. The Blond Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost a match to Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing the belts, Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion. Latham soon left Tennessee {{to compete in the}} World Wrestling Federation, where he held the WWF Tag Team Championship as Spot, a member of The Moondogs.|$|E
25|$|With {{their success}} in Memphis, <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> started to book them as well, having the Midnight Rockers split their time between Memphis and <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> {{territory}} – in Memphis the Midnight Rockers were heels but in <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> they were faces (good guys), something which was possible {{before the advent of}} national television deals and easy internet access. On December 27, 1987 The Midnight Rockers defeated The Original Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) for <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> World Tag Team title. Since they had won <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> World Tag Team titles, Jannetty and Michaels were forced to vacate <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Southern Tag Team titles in January 1988. While in the CWA, they had a brief feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express over <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> World Tag Team titles. After a short while in <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Jannetty and Michaels began asking for more money and a guaranteed contract from owner Verne Gagne. When this request was denied the Midnight Rockers quit <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> without having found another promotion for which to work. Before they left the promotion, they lost <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> Tag Team Championship on March 19 to Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>AWA</b> was {{no longer}} the top {{promotion}} after the WWWF rejoined the NWA. <b>The</b> <b>AWA</b> reached new heights, however, after powerhouse wrestler Hulk Hogan gained nationwide attention from starring in Rocky III, and became a solid fan favorite. Despite Hogan being the AWA's top draw, Gagne would not let him be champion, believing technical wrestlers, like him and Nick Bockwinkel, should be the focus of a wrestling company. Since founding <b>the</b> <b>AWA,</b> Gagne had built the company off of technical wrestling. Hogan left in 1983, irreparably damaging <b>the</b> <b>AWA.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Dale Gagner and his {{associate}} Jonnie Stewart, former AWA employees, {{began using}} <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> {{name in the}} state of Minnesota and formed a promotion known as AWA Superstars of Wrestling, infringing on <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> name. The promotion also created their own version of <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> World Heavyweight Championship. In April 2007, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) filed a lawsuit against Dale Gagner citing trademark infringement, as WWE owned all American Wrestling Association properties due to their purchase after the AWA's closure, including <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> World Heavyweight Championship. In October 2008, the court ruled in favor of WWE. The court ruling prohibits Gagner from exploiting or trading on <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> name or any other derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Key {{moments in}} the AWA-CWF {{relationship}} included Ric Converse capturing <b>the</b> <b>AWA</b> World Heavyweight Championship from Takao Omori on June 14, 2006, and his subsequent feud with Steve Corino over the title.

The semi-main event featured T.J.
