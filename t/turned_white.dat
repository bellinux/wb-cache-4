5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay <b>turned</b> <b>white.</b> Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E

500|$|There were {{concerns}} about Edward's health as a child, {{and he fell}} ill in 1246, 1247, and 1251. Nonetheless, he became an imposing man; at 6feet 2inches (1.88m) he towered over most of his contemporaries, and hence perhaps his epithet [...] "Longshanks", meaning [...] "long legs" [...] or [...] "long shins". The historian Michael Prestwich states that his [...] "long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman, long thighs one as a horseman. In youth, his curly hair was blond; in maturity it darkened, and in old age it <b>turned</b> <b>white.</b> [...] His speech, despite a lisp, {{was said to be}} persuasive." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, {{receiving}} marginal care in a dirty, wet environment. [...] A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm, done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful; he received an operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm. [...] He was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, François Chalais, whose report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968 {{and later in the}} U.S. on the CBS Evening News. [...] The film footage of McCain lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly, would {{become one of the most}} widely distributed images of McCain's imprisonment. [...] McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Tuân and Defense Minister and Army commander-in-chief General Võ Nguyên Giáp. [...] Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain must be part of America's political-military-economic elite. [...] Now having lost fifty pounds (twenty-three kilograms), in a chest cast, covered in grime and eyes full of fever, and with his hair <b>turned</b> <b>white,</b> in early December 1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed [...] "the Plantation". He was placed in a cell with George [...] "Bud" [...] Day, a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot (later awarded the Medal of Honor) and Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain to live another week. Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and kept him alive; Day later recalled that McCain had [...] "a fantastic will to live".|$|E
500|$|Dr. Donna Gooden acts as, {{among other}} things, the town's {{veterinarian}} and medical examiner. On Twin Peaks, Laura's best friend was named Donna, and Donna's father, Dr. Hayward, {{was also the}} town doctor and medical examiner. While drinking a Cherry Coke, Maudette states, [...] "Isn't cherry the best?" [...] Sherilyn Fenn, the actress who portrays Maudette, famously tied a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue in Twin Peaks. Later, Ray Wise suddenly has white hair, just as his Twin Peaks character Leland Palmer's hair <b>turned</b> <b>white</b> overnight in one episode. Dual Spires {{is famous for its}} cinnamon pie and apple cider, as Twin Peaks was famous for cherry pie and [...] "damn fine" [...] coffee. The mayor of Dual Spires is named Douglas Fir, and the town of Twin Peaks was filled with Douglas-fir trees. The local paper in Dual Spires is [...] "The Great Northern," [...] while Twin Peaks had a hotel called the Great Northern. In both series, there are stacks of donuts at the police station. In both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks, a sawmill was the source of the town's livelihood and burned down in a case of arson. Paula Merral is found wrapped in plastic by the lake, just as in Twin Peaks Laura Palmer's body was found [...] "dead, wrapped in plastic" [...] on a rocky beach. The Barkers have a framed prom photo of their niece wearing a tiara prominently displayed, and a similar photo of Laura Palmer remains the iconic Twin Peaks image. Leo the cinnamon owl was the festival mascot, whereas the character of Leo Johnson was suspected of Laura Palmer's murder in Twin Peaks. Owls were a major part of Peaks as well. The pet bird in Dr. Gooden's waiting room was the same type of bird that bit Laura's shoulder in Twin Peaks. There is similar camera work and sound effect focus on a ceiling fan whipping around {{at the top of the}} stairs at Sheriff Jackson's house; this happened often in Twin Peaks. The sheriff's house also looks similar to the Palmers' house. Paula secretly dated the sheriff's son and shared [...] "secret special lover earrings" [...] with him, and in Twin Peaks, Laura and the nephew of one of the townsmen each had half of a golden heart necklace. A local teenage boy wears a jeweled crown. In Peaks, Audrey Horne's older brother wore a Native American headdress. In both series, the sheriff's deputy is a Native American who is very in tune with nature. Sheriff Andrew Jackson's name references the seventh president of the United States, just as the name of the sheriff of Twin Peaks, Harry Truman, references the 33rd. Shawn and Gus find a book written by Earl Wyndam; in Peaks, Windom Earle was a psychopathic ex-FBI agent.|$|E

In later times the change to white was not invariable: a proof of the people's moral and spiritual deterioration, that was gradually on the increase, until forty years before the destruction of the Second Temple, when the change of color was no longer observed (l.c. 39b).|$|E

Like Apple's single-button mice, all of their trackpads have no more than one button (though some early PowerBooks had a second physical button, it was electrically the same as the primary button;) also like Apple's new mice, their latest trackpads—beginning with the unibody MacBooks and MacBook Pros—eliminated physical buttons.|$|E

2500|$|The Custer Wolf {{was shot}} {{seven months after}} Williams arrived in South Dakota. To the {{surprise}} of many residents of Custer, the animal they had thought a monstrosity of nature was just a normal North American gray wolf, [...] heavy and just over [...] in length. The wolf was so aged that his pelt had <b>turned</b> <b>white.</b> Williams noted that the wolf's teeth would have been strong enough to hunt for another 15 years. In an interview Williams gave 40 years after leaving South Dakota, {{he spoke of the}} great respect he had for the wolf for giving him the most difficult hunt of his career. In total, the Custer Wolf killed more than 500 livestock and horses, worth around $25,000, or $ in [...] dollars.|$|E
2500|$|There was ongoing {{contention}} {{about the}} results and meaning of intervention studies undertaken before the introduction of statins. A meta-analysis of cholesterol-lowering trials found that trials that were supportive of the lipid hypothesis were cited almost six times as often as those that were not, and {{although there was a}} similar number of trials unsupportive of the hypothesis, none of them were cited after 1970; some of the supportive reviews also exclude and ignore certain trials which were less favorable to the hypothesis. This meta-analysis, including the less-cited trials, found that mortality was not decreased by lowering cholesterol, and that the lowering of cholesterol was unlikely to prevent coronary heart disease. Uffe Ravnskov, director of [...] The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics, maintains that [...] "prominent scientists have <b>turned</b> <b>white</b> into black by ignoring all conflicting observations; by twisting and exaggerating trivial findings; by citing studies with opposing results in a way to make them look supportive; and by ignoring or scorning the work of critical scientists." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1810, she was {{presented}} to the elected heir to the throne, Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden. During his visit, he stopped before the portrait of her grandson Gustav, and informed her that he wished to adopt him for his successor. Later that year (2 November 1810), she {{was presented}} to the next elected heir to the throne, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. He regarded her with suspicion and believed that she did not wish to see him, but she commented: [...] "I am grateful for the sensitivity of the Crown prince, but he is mistaken, if he believe that I do not wish to see him! It would be unfair if I were to hold the least bit dislike toward him, for it is not he who has deposed my son!" [...] At the meeting, her face were to have <b>turned</b> <b>white,</b> but at the end, she {{is said to have been}} delighted by his charm.
