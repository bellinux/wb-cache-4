5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for <b>those</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In <b>those</b> <b>situations,</b> {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to <b>those</b> <b>situations</b> in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E

25|$|All {{definitions}} {{are ultimately}} circular in nature since {{they depend on}} concepts which must themselves have definitions, a dependence which cannot be continued indefinitely without returning to the starting point. To avoid this vicious circle certain concepts must be taken as primitive concepts; terms which are given no definition. In geometry, it is frequently {{the case that the}} concept of line is taken as a primitive. In <b>those</b> <b>situations</b> where a line is a defined concept, as in coordinate geometry, some other fundamental ideas are taken as primitives. When the line concept is a primitive, the behaviour and properties of lines are dictated by the axioms which they must satisfy.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, {{holds that}} {{peacekeeping}} interventions actually do substantively matter following {{the end of}} a civil war. She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to <b>those</b> <b>situations</b> where interventions do not occur, is partly to blame for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, more risky post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions do in fact help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.|$|E

They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that {{it is too soon to}} call <b>those</b> <b>situations</b> failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through.

25|$|Primary {{states are}} defined by anthropologists Spencer & Redmond as those states that {{developed}} in a context with no contact or prior development of a state in the area. These are <b>those</b> <b>situations</b> where states developed {{for the first time}} in that social environment. The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places; However, the list typically includes the first states to develop in Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Indus river valley, North China, Peru, and Mesoamerica. Cohen identifies six zones of independent state development: 1) a zone stretching from Europe and North Africa through the Middle East to East and South Asia, 2) Mesoamerica, 3) Peru, 4) West Africa, 5) East Africa, 6) Polynesia.|$|E
