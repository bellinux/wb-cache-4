Ward manufactured water-tube boilers in many sizes.

40|$|Northern Transportation Company Limited, {{the primary}} {{provider}} of marine transportation services on the Mackenzie River system in Northern Canada, {{has embarked on}} a major refit program of their extremely shallow draft river and coastal tugs. The refit program of the company's 11 tugs operating in the Western Arctic region began in 2001 and continues today. The primary goal of the program has been to extend the life of the vessels and improve their performance by incorporating tested features learned through many years of operational experience while also introducing new technology. Severe operating conditions and shallow draft design constraints provide considerable challenges for the design of the vessels ' <b>tunnel</b> <b>stern</b> hull form, pro-pulsion system, and steering system. The performance improvements have been recorded through tests and trials {{as well as by the}} analysis of operational results after the completion of vessel modifications. Full-scale trial results of the maneuverability and bollard pull characteristics add to the understanding of these unique vessels...|$|E
40|$|A novel ship concept {{which is}} called ULBS (Ultra Large Block {{coefficient}} ship) to reduce CO 2 emission form sea transportation is under investigation at Yokohama National University. Since ULBS {{is supposed to have}} a very blunt hull, flow field analysis around a ship is crucial for a design of hull forms with better hydrodynamic performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is expected to be an efficient design tool for unconventional hull forms such as ULBS. However, it is desirable to examine applicability of the CFD method to analysis of similar flows before the actual design application. Thus, free surface flow computations of two box-shaped ships which can be considered as the extreme cases of ULBS are carried out. Grid convergence study is performed with respect to resistance for the verification of the results. Total resistance coefficients are compared with each other and also with available experimental data. The pressure and velocity distributions of the two ships are compared with each other. The flow structures with large separations are observed and the influences of the box geometry to the flow fields are discussed. This knowledge is used in the computation of ULBS. After that to investigate the flow characteristics of ULBS (Cb> 0. 95), free surface viscous flows around the ship with and without a <b>stern</b> <b>tunnel</b> are computed by the solver. Total resistance coefficients are compared {{with each other and with}} experimental data. The pressure and velocity distributions of the two ships are compared with each other. Also, grid convergence study is performed with respect to resistance for the verification of the results. The velocity distributions behind the stern of the two ships are compared with each other. The three dimensional vortical structures in the stern of the two hulls are analyzed and compared with each other. Massive flow separations behind the stern due to the bluntness of a hull and effects of a <b>stern</b> <b>tunnel</b> to flow fields are discussed and this knowledge will be used on the future design of ULBS...|$|R
40|$|A complex {{interaction}} between a <b>stern</b> <b>tunnel</b> thruster and main propellers is reckoned {{to be responsible}} for a con-siderable decay of the DP system performance during ma-noeuvring operations, in terms of drop of turning moment with increasing loading on the main propellers. In the present work a RANS method is used to depict the flow field and to investigate the hydrodynamic forces acting on a modified version of an offshore vessel model with two main ducted propellers and a tunnel thruster integrated in the stern skeg. The model was previously investigated in model tests carried out in the large towing tank at the Ma-rine Technology Centre in Trondheim. In this work differ-ent loading conditions for the main propellers and for the tunnel thruster are considered in accordance with the model tests. The commercial solver Fluent is applied to study the viscous turbulent flow around the ship hull. The propellers in the ducts as well as the one in the tunnel are represented by an actuator disk approximation, and appropriate distri-butions of thrust and tangential velocity are imposed on the fan disks. Validation of the numerical results is made by comparison against the experimental data. Results are in good agreement with model tests and the thrust loss effects are well represented by CFD calculations. The final aims are to provide physical understanding of the causes of the loss of turning moment, and to investigate the use of RANS calculations as a tool for propeller-thruster and propeller-hull interaction studies, so that the propeller arrangement and DP system design can be readily optimised with re-spect to manoeuvring efficiency...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTWhile {{displacement}} type Deep-V mono hulls have superior seakeeping behaviour at speed, catamarans {{typically have}} modest behaviour in rough seas. It {{is therefore a}} logical progression to combine the superior seakeeping performance of a displacement type Deep-V mono-hull with the high-speed benefits of a catamaran to take the advantages of both hull forms. The displacement Deep-V catamaran concept was developed in Newcastle University and Newcastle University's own multi-purpose research vessel, which was launched in 2011, pushed the design envelope still further with the successful adoption of a novel anti-slamming bulbous bow and <b>tunnel</b> <b>stern</b> for improved efficiency. This paper presents the hullform development of this unique vessel to understand {{the contribution of the}} novel bow and stern features on the performance of the Deep-V catamaran. The study is also a further validation of the hull resistance by using advanced numerical analysis methods in conjunction with the model test. An assessment of the numerical predictions of the hull resistance is also made against physical model test results and shows a good agreement between them...|$|E
