50|$|On 10 March 2010, Pegasus Airlines Flight 361, an Airbus A319 {{operated}} by IZair on a ferry flight, made {{an emergency landing}} at Frankfurt Airport, Germany after a malfunction in <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> flight landed safely but blew both front <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> tires. <b>The</b> airport closed runway 07R/25L for 3 hours to allow recovery. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> suffered <b>the</b> same problem as JetBlue Flight 292.|$|R
50|$|Following {{unsuccessful}} troubleshooting {{the crew}} decided to divert to Mehrabad where a low approach confirmed <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> was not extended.

Hydraulic pressure for retraction and extension of the gear is transmitted by a system of tubing, hoses and actuating cylinders and is electrically controlled by limit switches and solenoid valves. Emergency extension can be accomplished pneumatically in case of hydraulic or electrical system failure. The main gear is enclosed by two doors after retraction. The inboard doors are hydraulically operated while the outboard doors are mechanically operated by linkage connected to the main <b>gear</b> struts. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> doors operate mechanically with linkages attached to <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> shock strut.|$|R
