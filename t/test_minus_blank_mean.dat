40|$|Reaction {{rates of}} succinate and lactate {{dehydrogenase}} activity in cryostat sections of rat liver, tracheal epithelium and heart muscle were monitored by continuous measurement of formazan formation by cytophotometry at room temperature. Incubation media contained polyvinyl alcohol as tissue protectant and Tetranitro BT as final electron acceptor. Control media lacked either substrate or substrate and coenzyme. Controls were also performed by adding malonate (a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase), pyruvate (a non-competitive inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase), oxalate (a competitive inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase) or N-ethylmaleimide (a blocker of SH groups). A specific malonate-sensitive linear <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control response for succinate dehydrogenase activity was obtained in liver (1. 6 mumol H 2 cm- 3 min- 1) and tracheal epithelium (0. 8 mumol H 2 cm- 3 min- 1) {{but not in}} heart muscle. All variations in the incubation conditions tested {{did not result in}} a linear <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control response in the latter tissue. Because the reaction was sensitive to malonate, it was concluded that the initial reaction rate was the specific rate of succinate dehydrogenase activity in heart muscle (9. 1 mumol H 2 cm- 3 min- 1). Test minus control reactions for lactate dehydrogenase activity were distinctly non-linear for all tissues tested. This appeared to be due to product inhibition by pyruvate generated during the reaction and therefore it was concluded that the appropriate control reaction was the test reaction in the presence of 20 mM pyruvate.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of section {{thickness}} on the reaction rate of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) activity in unfixed sections of rat liver by use of continuous monitoring by microdensitometry of the reaction product as it formed in the section during incubation. Tetranitro BT or nitro BT was used as final electron acceptor and polyvinyl alcohol as tissue stabilizer. Each <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control reaction curve deviated from linearity during the first 2 min of incubation. This was mainly due to loss of low molecular weight endogenous dehydrogenase substrates {{from the surface of}} the section. For any given reaction, the same absolute amount of endogenous substrate was lost from each section, and hence a much greater proportion was lost from the thinner sections. Such losses lead to a deficit in (nonspecific) formazan production. There was a greater loss from, and hence a greater deficit in, formazan production in sections incubated at 30 degrees C than at 37 degrees C and when nitro BT was used instead of tetranitro BT, but the greatest loss of endogenous substrates occurred in sections incubated in control media. Therefore, greater losses seemed to occur when the reactions were slower because of failure to overcome the critical supersaturation level of the formazan. A consequence of this was a non-linear <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control response during the first minutes of the incubatio...|$|R

40|$|The indoxyl-tetranitro BT {{method for}} the {{demonstration}} of alkaline phosphatase activity has been optimized and its validity for quantitative histochemistry tested. The study has been performed with model films of polyacrylamide gel incorporating homogenate of rat liver and with cryostat sections from the same livers. Addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the incubation medium greatly improved the localization of the final reaction product in cryostat sections. In polyacrylamide films, the formazan production specifically due to alkaline phosphatase was highest when using a medium containing 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9. 0, 0. 2 - 1. 0 mM substrate, 0. 32 mM 1 -methoxyphenazine methosulphate, 10 mM MgCl 2, 5 mM sodium azide and 1 mM tetranitro BT. For the incubation of cryostat sections {{in the presence of}} polyvinyl alcohol, the same medium could be used but the optimum concentrations of substrate and tetranitro BT appeared to be 1 - 2 mM and 5 mM respectively. The <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control reaction was specific for alkaline phosphatase activity and could be inhibited completely with tetramisole. The <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control reaction was linear with time up to 30 min with model films and up to 15 min with cryostat sections. The formazan production was also linear with the amount of homogenate incorporated in model films and with section thickness up to 18 micron and therefore, the reaction obeyed the Beer-Lambert law. Variation of the substrate concentration yielded a KM of 0. 05 mM for aqueous media and a KM of 0. 55 mM for polyvinyl alcohol-containing media. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|The precise histochemical {{localization}} and quantification of {{the activity}} of soluble dehydrogenases in unfixed cryostat sections {{requires the use of}} tissue protectants. In this study, two protectants, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and agarose gel, were compared for assaying the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) in normal female mouse liver. Quantification of enzyme activity was determined cytophotometrically in periportal (PP), pericentral (PC) and midzonal (MZ) areas. No coloured reaction product was present in PVA media after the incubation period. In contrast, the agarose gels appeared to be highly coloured after incubation. As a consequence, sections incubated with gel media were less intensely stained than those incubated in PVA-containing media. The specific G 6 PDH reaction (<b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control) yielded approximately 75 % less formazan in sections incubated by the agarose gel method than with the PVA method. Further, the amount of formazan deposits attributable to G 6 PDH activity was highest in the midzonal and pericentral zones of the liver lobule with PVA media, and Kupffer cells could be discriminated easily because of their high G 6 PDH activity. Significant zonal differences or Kupffer cells could not be observed when agarose gel films were used for the detection of G 6 PDH activity. The LDH localization patterns appeared to be more uniform after incubation with both methods: no significant differences in specific <b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control reactions were seen between PP, PC and MZ. However, less formazan production (33 %) was detected in sections incubated with agarose gels when compared with those incubated with PVA media. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Creatine kinase {{activity}} (EC 2. 7. 3. 2.) {{has been}} demonstrated in myocardium and skeletal muscle from rats by a method based on the incubation of cryostat sections with a polyvinyl alcohol-containing medium {{and the use of}} auxiliary enzymes. Hexokinase and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase were spread on object glasses before mounting the sections to be incubated. In this way, the auxiliary enzymes were interposed between glass slide and section thus preventing loss of formazan generated within the sections. Creatine kinase activity was found to be localized in finely dispersed form along the myofibrils and as large granules in the sarcoplasm of myocardium and skeletal muscle. The formazan produced specifically by creatine kinase (<b>test</b> <b>minus</b> control), as measured cytophotometrically at 585 nm, was completely inhibited by 2 mM 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene, a specific inhibitor of creatine kinase activity.
