500|$|I am in Lewisburg. I am calm, certain in my thoughts, {{and doing}} {{mathematics}} {{most of the}} time. I am kind of [...] "above things," [...] fully aware of what is up. Do not {{worry too much about}} me, though anything might happen. I know, Pete, that you are strong and decent. At first I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should not visit me here. I do not know. With the world in turmoil I now feel that a boy your age should experience what is coming his way – fully digest it without getting a [...] "belly ache," [...] so to speak, nor getting off the right track of truth, fact, honesty, fair play, and being above board–never a sneak....|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{long as it}} doesn't {{become a}} habit," [...] she murmured. [...] "I am sure I am not exacting, but I should hate to feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were always so engrossed in your <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did not even realize whom you were sitting next." ...|$|R

2500|$|When the two {{themes are}} {{combined}} each note of (the first part of) the Beethoven theme {{is followed by}} the same note in the Elgar theme. So musically Elgar [...] "follows" [...] Beethoven, as Jaeger told him to do (see above, Var. IX) and, by doing so, in the vigorous, optimistic Finale the artist triumphs over his sadness and loneliness, expressed in the minor melody from the beginning. The whole piece is based on this [...] "Elgar theme", in which the Beethoven theme is hidden (and so the latter [...] "goes through and over the whole set, but is not played"). Although Elgar had told Dora Penny in private about the Beethoven story and the Pathétique theme behind the Jaeger/Nimrod-variation (see above, Var. IX) she could not solve the enigma because she did not see the connection between this and the enigma. Elgar had expected she would: [...] "I'm surprised. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> of all people would guess it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were always}} so much above {{the world in}} money matters. Gracious me;--nothing that I have heard {{for a long time}} has {{astonished}} me more. I don't know why, but I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had your things so very snug." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] the man said, [...] "but the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{could speak}} Punjabi {{did not enter}} my mind. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were a young white officer who had just come out from England. I learnt it because I served, for fifteen years, in the 32nd Punjabis." ...|$|E
5000|$|International Business Times {{called it}} a [...] "sweet family entertainer". The Times of India said, [...] "On the whole, it's one of those cute family movies packed with a basket-full of laughter, emotions, and <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can give in to, without a second thought.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I cannot speak; I {{know not}} what to say. My brain sinks under the effort. It is a wild, a {{complicated}} tale; {{it relates to}} feelings with which <b>you</b> cannot sympathise, <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot share. O Glastonbury! there is no hope; there is no solace.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} very wrong," [...] she said suddenly, after walking for some time in silence. [...] "You must have worked hard indeed. I own I never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would. I used to {{consider}} your sketches very pretty, but I never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would come {{to be a great}} artist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{answered}} Tua. [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would rob us, for if {{you were}} of the tribe of thieves, surely you would be richer, and less hungry than you seem. I only <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were almost blind, Father Kepher, and therefore could not {{know the difference between}} a pearl and a pebble." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "There's {{something}} about him--I don't know what--that doesn't leave you feeling how bad you are, but {{makes you want}} to be better. He helps you so; and he's so clear. And he shows that he's had all the mean and silly <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have. I don't know--it's as if he were talking for each person alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lord!" [...] gasped Eustace, [...] "I {{had no idea}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were so particular; I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{would be}} glad of the job." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I was wondering," [...] said Mary, with a gasp, [...] "whether {{they really}} were unattached. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> might...you might..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I have heard, Lady Eustace, and I {{have just}} come to offer you my sympathy. When I was told <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did see people, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> would admit me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Indeed no. I {{have never}} turned against you. I have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{would be better}} here than at Folking for the present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{should have}} <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{could have done}} so now; that is, before long. Will Sir Hugh remain here at Clavering?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how came you here, captain?" [...] asked Tomlinson. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> maybe <b>you</b> {{had been}} taken down by the suck of the ship." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I cannot {{possibly}} tell. If {{she does}} it is not with my knowledge. I should have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could best answer that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems strange," [...] she remarked, [...] "that you and {{he should}} be working together. I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were on {{opposite}} sides." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marion {{spoke in}} dry, broken {{fragments}} of sentences. [...] "You... I'd always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> anyhow <b>you</b> couldn't deceive me... I suppose {{all men are}} horrid--about this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had not {{dreamed of}} <b>that.</b> I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> {{would let me}} come {{to you for a}} few weeks,--till I should know what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> {{might want}} me to come back again," [...] said Ralph;--"and, if so, I could make arrangements;--perhaps for a week or ten days." ...|$|R
