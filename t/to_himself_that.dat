5|$|At {{the end of}} the novel, Bambi {{meets with}} twin fawns who are calling for their mother and he scolds them {{for not being able to}} stay alone. After leaving them, he thinks <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> the girl fawn {{reminded}} him of Faline, and that the male was promising and that Bambi hoped to meet him again when he was grown.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> it could not survive him.|$|E

5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} between PedroII and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, Afonso, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina {{gave birth to}} more children: Isabel, in 1846; Leopoldina, in 1847; and lastly, Pedro, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, {{his view of the}} Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>that</b> it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. PedroII excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy {{with how}} his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a {{personal}} trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt {{to return to the}} NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to lift his suspension. He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and league doctors. Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames. He said he wanted to prove <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.|$|E

5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and had {{mastered}} many important Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is {{thoroughly}} devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough and tumble and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) are not about to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E

25|$|A genius swordsman and {{officer of}} the Shinsengumi. He has strong bonds with Kond≈çwho raised Okita {{from the age of}} nine after Okita's mother and {{siblings}} could no longer afford to care for him, and Hijikatawhom he loves and respects like a brother. He is the first person to discover Sei's true sex and he is her main confidant on matters relating to it. He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had gotten her revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai. After the Ikedaya Affair, he admits he has affections for Sei as if she were his own kin. Over a year after those events he realizes he is in love with her. When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide in front of him and Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance is that he has dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita S≈çji.|$|E
25|$|Wanting {{to go back}} to his {{interesting}} life, Kyon activates {{the program}} and goes back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.|$|E

While watching the first episode of the show, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", premiering on television in December 1989, Jean opined <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> the series was the greatest project he had been involved with and desired to continue working on {{it for the rest}} of his professional career. What he enjoyed most about The Simpsons at the time was something he recognized from Brooks' previous work: although the show was largely based on humor, it had depth and warmth.|$|E

The narrator remarks <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> his [...] "friend" [...] the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as [...] "other friends have flown before" [...] along with his previous hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with [...] "Nevermore".

Becca Badget of Yahoo! wrote: [...] "Kevin keeps <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he married Angelina to avoid a bullet from Angelo's henchman. The guests are unaware that he married her to stay alive." [...] While this happened, Kevin's mother Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman) was {{involved}} with Angelo, who had kidnapped and sent away her husband Jeffrey Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) to have Gloria for himself. On whether or not Kevin will ever love her, DeGarmo said: [...] "I know she sure hopes so. She did {{try to get him}} to marry her." [...] The relationship, however, ended when Angelina realizes that he never loved her. DeGarmo said: [...] "Kevin does see the light inside Angelina, even though that light may be a little dim sometimes." ...|$|E
500|$|France stated {{his vision}} of the film was {{different}} from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his [...] "amiable, nerdy genius" [...] incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced Brian Banner, Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he is not like his father. However, he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created, which makes everything worse. The [...] "Don't make me angry..." [...] line from the TV series was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the [...] "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the black ops made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.|$|E

500|$|Here Come the Warm Jets is {{the debut}} solo album by Brian Eno, {{credited}} only as [...] "Eno". Produced by him, {{it was released}} on Island Records in January 1974. The musical style of Here Come the Warm Jets is a hybrid of glam rock and art pop, similar to Eno's previous album work with Roxy Music, although in a stronger experimental fashion. In developing the album's words and music, Eno used unusual methods such as dancing for his band members and having them play accordingly, and singing nonsense words <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> would {{form the basis of}} subsequent lyrics. The album features various guest musicians, including members of Roxy Music, Hawkwind, Matching Mole and Pink Fairies, as well as Chris Spedding, and Robert Fripp of King Crimson, who collaborated with Eno a year before in (No Pussyfooting).|$|E
500|$|The script {{comments}} cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at {{one point}} a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only [...] "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for [...] "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't [...] "look like him at all", and Lennon saying <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> [...] "she looks more like him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: [...] "Uh, no, I'm a mocker", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a [...] "clean old man" [...] sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a [...] "dirty old man".|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is missing}} Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), a former NBC page {{who was fired}} in the {{previous}} episode, [...] "I Do Do".

Later, Tracy roams the city and sees Kenneth, who is now working as a page at CBS. Tracy believes Kenneth is a hallucination. Later, the two run into each other again and Kenneth tries to talk to Tracy, but Tracy refuses to acknowledge him as he believes his mind is playing tricks on him. To prove he is real, Kenneth throws himself in front of a car, thus making Tracy believe him. He pleads with Kenneth to come back to NBC, but Kenneth says he is happy working at CBS. At the end of the credits, Kenneth admits <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> <b>that</b> he lied to Tracy and that he misses everyone at TGS. [...] Kenneth then starts hallucinating Tracy.|$|E
