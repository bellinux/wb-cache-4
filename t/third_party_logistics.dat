To aid firms in deciding whether to outsource RL activities, a characterization of RL networks according to two critical factors is proposed. These factors are {{the length of the}} product life cycle, which affects variability of expected returns over time, and the uncertainty of the rate of returns in each time period. Even if changes in the average return rate according to the life cycle are well understood, the variability in returns relative to the known average differs significantly depending on the product characteristics, as well as the length of each stage in its life cycle. Some of the most important RL networks in the U. S. market are classified in the proposed categories.

Today, many multinational enterprises (MNEs) work closely with their logistics providers to enhance their competitive positions, They increasingly outsource their non-strategic business functions, with logistics providers picking up this new source of business. The MNE is moving more towards a 'front-end' or customer focused operation, with their key logistics providers aligning themselves as supply chain integrators.

50|$|A fourth <b>party</b> <b>logistics</b> {{provider}} has no own transport assets or warehouse capacity.

The idea of a fourth-party logistics provider was born in the seventies by the consulting company Accenture. Firms are outsourcing their selection of third-party logistics provider and the optimization process of the integration of these to a PL as an intermediary. That reduces costs and the 4PL have to have an overview about the whole logistics market to choose the ideal 3PL for all operative logistic activities. For being able to provide such an ideal solution fourth <b>party</b> <b>logistics</b> providers need a good knowledge of the logistics branch and a good IT infrastructure. A fourth <b>party</b> <b>logistics</b> provider selects the 3PL providers from the market which are most suitable for the logistical issues of his customer.
