Released {{in the same year}} the show premiered, on November 22, the game is of the city-building genre. The game, Littlest Pet Shop, is freemium software—microtransactions allows users to speed up the progression of the game. The game provides over 150 animal companions for users to collect; minigames allow players to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> pets. Its initial release was for the iOS platform. An Android port was released shortly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|Regarding health care, Ron Paul {{said that}} “managed care isn’t working” and that “drug {{companies}} lobby for managed care”. Paul said, “We could <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> poor people if we weren’t {{trying to maintain}} an empire overseas”. Ron Paul hit continued {{to discuss the issue}} of military non-interventionism, “70% of Americans want war over with and {{are sick and tired of}} big government at home and overseas”. They want their “civil liberties and not allow government to spend endlessly and bankrupt us”. Paul also answered questions related to his experience with Medicaid and endorsed allowing civil unions for same-sex couples country-wide, with marriage itself handled solely by religious institutions.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} McCormick's tour, Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney {{looked for}} a {{successor}} who would be better at {{standing up to the}} British staff at SACLANT headquarters. [...] "I had felt a great deal of concern about the handling of the United States interests down there and in the Atlantic, vis-à-vis the British...I had felt that the United States viewpoint had been handled rather naively in some previous instances and that it was imperative that we put somebody down there who could <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> interests." [...] Carney selected Admiral Jerauld Wright, who relieved McCormick on April 12, 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god {{takes care of}} the things in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he takes care of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take care of everything. On the other hand, if he takes care of only some things, why does he <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken care of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take care of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is {{able to take care of}} everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take care of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take care of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take care of the things in the cosmos.|$|E

25|$|In {{the debates}} one issue was {{especially}} important: {{the treatment of}} 26,000 asylum seekers which had been in legal procedures for over five years. The left-wing opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL and CU, joined by former coalition-partner D66 wanted a general pardon for this group, granting them all a residence permit. The CDA, VVD and the smaller right-wing parties of Geert Wilders and Marco Pastors opposed such a permit because it would attract illegal immigrants. Minister Verdonk claimed that she had actually already <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> 26,000 asylum seekers, sending many back to their own country and granting many a residence permit.|$|R
5000|$|Sigben - Sigben are {{invisible}} creatures. This {{is probably the}} reason people say that Sigben looks like a dog with the features of a cat and a goat.

60|$|This {{time the}} prince, too, was embarrassed, and {{questioned}} the merchant closely. The merchant felt that his credit was at stake, and whilst inwardly determining {{that he would}} not carry the joke any further, could not help describing Wali Dad in such glowing terms that the old man would never have known himself had he heard them. The prince, like the king of Khaistan, determined that he would send in return a gift that would be truly royal, and which would perhaps prevent the unknown giver sending him anything more. So he made up a caravan on twenty splendid horses caparisoned in gold embroidered cloths, with fine morocco saddles and silver bridles and stirrups, also twenty camels of the best breed, which had the speed of race-horses, and could swing along at a trot all day without getting tired; and, lastly, twenty elephants, with magnificent silver howdahs and coverings of silk embroidered with pearls. To <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> animals the merchant hired a little army of men; and the troop made a great show as they travelled along.|$|E
60|$|August 9th.--A pretty {{comfortable}} day, as to warmth, and I {{believe there}} is sunshine overhead; but a sea-cloud, composed of fog and coal-smoke, envelops Liverpool. At Rock Ferry, when I left it at half past nine, there was promise of a cheerful day. A good many gentlemen (or, rather, respectable business people) came in the boat, {{and it is not}} unpleasant, on these fine mornings, to take the breezy atmosphere of the river. The huge steamer Great Britain, bound for Australia, lies right off the Rock Ferry landing; and at a little distance are two old hulks of ships of war, dismantled, roofed over, and anchored in the river, formerly for quarantine purposes, but now used chiefly or solely as homes for old seamen, whose light labor it is to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> condemned ships. There are a great many steamers plying up and down the river to various landings in the vicinity; and a good many steam-tugs; also, many boats, most of which have dark-red or tan-colored sails, being oiled to resist the wet; also, here and there, a yacht or pleasure-boat, and a few ships riding stately at their anchors, probably on the point of sailing. The river, however, is by no means crowded; because the immense multitude of ships are ensconced in the docks, where their masts make an intricate forest for miles up and down the Liverpool shore. The small black steamers, whizzing industriously along, many of them crowded with passengers, snake up the chief life of the scene. The Mersey has the color of a mud-puddle, and no atmospheric effect, as far as I have seen, ever gives it a more agreeable tinge.|$|E
60|$|A {{settlement}} in mortmain is in Scotland termed a mortification, {{and in one}} great borough (Aberdeen, if I remember rightly) there is a municipal officer who <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> public endowments, and is thence called the Master of Mortifications. One would almost presume that the term had its origin in the effect which such settlements usually produce upon the kinsmen of those by whom they are executed. Heavy at least was the mortification which befell the audience who, in the late Mrs. Margaret Bertram's parlour, had listened to this unexpected destination of the lands of Singleside. There was a profound silence after the deed had been read over.|$|R
40|$|Class D {{amplifiers}} {{find new}} applications in RFID systems, {{because of their}} high efficiency. Most textbooks describe {{the case of a}} load directly connected to the amplifier. However, in most RFID systems the usage of a transmission line is mandatory and this may introduce some novel effects, {{in the form of an}} infinite series of peaks in the system frequency response functions. If not appropriately <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of,</b> <b>these</b> effects may lead to electromagnetic compatibility problems. The purpose of the paper is to develop the theory of the peak control function, which is conceived as a tool that allows the designer to keep the magnitude of the peaks, and hence their influence on the system, into well defined limits...|$|R
40|$|Processing of squinted SAR {{spotlight}} data is {{a challenge}} because of the significant range migration effects of the raw data over the coherent aperture time. Although in theory the (&#x 03 C 9;, k) -algorithm <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> aspects, its digital implementation requires a time-consuming interpolation step. Moreover, the limited precision of this interpolation can introduce distortions {{at the edges of}} the final image especially for squinted geometries. A wave number domain processing using a modified Stolt mapping will be developed and analyzed to enhance the quality of the final SAR image. Additionally, the proposed algorithm has a decreased computational load compared to the original (&#x 03 C 9;,k) -algorithm. Simulation results will validate the focusing and efficiency performances of the modified wave number domain algorithm...|$|R
