30|$|Because of {{the poor}} {{degradability}} of PBT and vPvB substances, there is concern that effects in organisms cannot be predicted in the long run. Accumulation in organisms is virtually irreversible {{and the content of}} these substances in the environmental compartments can only very slowly be reduced by lowering the emissions. Moreover, some PBT and vPvB substances, such as PFC, have the potential to pollute remote areas through long-range <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>air</b> and water. Even when standardized tests in the laboratory show no toxic effects, chronic effects may occur through long-term exposure to low doses. Because of the long life cycles of organisms {{at the end of the}} food chain, these effects will hardly be predictable. And the concentrations of PBT and vPvB substances in man and the environment cannot be predicted over long periods of time. This is another reason why chronic effects cannot be excluded. Therefore, according to the principles of REACH, for PBT and vPvB substances no safe levels can be derived for the environment [24].|$|E

Patients were described, followed by a bivariate analysis with condition (live or dead) at time of discharge as the dependent variable. A multiple Poisson regression with robust variance model was used to adjust associations. ResultsA total of 176 neonates were transported by ambulance (10. 22 % by air) over six months. The transport distances were longer by air (median: 237. 5 km) than by ground (median: 11. 3 km). Mortality was higher among neonates transported by air (33. 33 %) than by ground (7. 79 %). No differences in survival {{were found between the}} two groups when adjusted by the multiple model. An interaction between mode of transport and distance was observed. Live hospital discharge was found to be associated with clinical severity upon admittance, birth weight, hemorrhaging during the third trimester, and serum potassium levels when admitted.

30|$|Within Annex XIII of the REACH legislation, the {{identification}} of SVHC may also be justified on ‘weight-of-evidence’ information, i.e. results from monitoring in the field, from suitable laboratory experiments, or on elevated pollutant concentrations in organisms compared to concentrations in their environment, especially in endemic or endangered species. This goes along with the recommendations of ECHA who points out in Chapter R. 11 PBT Assessment of the Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment that remote areas and their ‘intrinsic value of pristine environments’ (p. 7) should be protected from adverse effects of chemical substances [2]. In addition, ‘borderline chemicals’ which fail {{at least one of}} the persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T) criteria but show an equivalent level of concern, e.g. by widespread distribution and long-range transport potential (LRTP), should be considered as SVHC within a PBT assessment. Nevertheless, the LRTP of an organic compound is not yet considered under REACH, although LRTP is also defined as a property of concern according to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) [3] in addition to persistence, bioaccumulation and adverse effects. Substances with LRTP cross international boundaries and may be <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> <b>air,</b> water [4] or with migrating animals to particularly sensitive ecosystems like the Arctic. This is of special interest when one substance fails or misses PBT or vPvB criteria slightly. Especially in these borderline cases, LRTP can be a significant property to indicate very high concern and support a prioritization of chemicals. Currently, the publicly available REACH database of end 2012 contains 5, 306 publishable compounds registered in the European Union and can be downloaded from the official homepage of the European Chemicals Agency [5]. ‘Publishable’ substances include all of the 5, 705 registered compounds except those where either the IUPAC name is claimed confidential according to REACH Article 119 (2) (f) or (g) or where there has been no dossier disseminated. For the remaining 5, 306 substances, at least one registration document has been processed and been published (in a filtered version) on the Dissemination Portal [5].|$|R

40|$|Plants {{respond to}} local {{herbivory}} or pathogen infection with phenotypic changes, which {{reduce the danger}} of future attack. This so-called induced resistance is usually not restricted to the attacked plant organ but is also expressed in distant, so far undamaged parts of the plant. Signaling compounds such as jasmonic acid and salicylic acid have been discovered that move within the plant via the xylem or the phloem and elicit the resistance, thus acting as plant hormones. We now found that volatiles released in response to herbivore damage are required to elicit extrafloral nectar secretion {{in other parts of}} the same plant. Extrafloral nectar attracts ants and other carnivorous arthropods and serves as an effective indirect defense against herbivores. So called green leaf volatiles are released within minutes in response to tissue damage and were among the compounds that induced nectar secretion in yet undamaged parts of the damaged plant, but also in neighboring plants. Being gaseous and <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> the <b>air,</b> green leaf volatiles can serve a rapid within-plant communication, which moves much faster from one plant organ to the other than any plant-internal compound...|$|R

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of eight organophosphate esters (OPEs) {{have been investigated}} in air, snow and seawater samples collected during the 'cruise of ARK-XXVIII/ 2 from sixth June to third July 2014 across the North Atlantic and the Arctic. The sum of gaseous and particle concentrations (Sigma OPE) ranged from 3 S to 343 pg/m(3). The three chkirinated OPEs accounted for 88 +/- 5 % of the Sigma OPE. The most abundant OPE was tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), with concentrations ranging from 30 to 227 pg/m(3), followed by three major OPEs; such as tris(1 -chloro, 2 -propyl) phosphate (TCPP, 0. 8 to 82 pg/M- 3), tri. 'n-butyl phosphate (TnBP, 2 to 19 pg/m(3)), and tri-iso-butyi phosphate (TiBP, 0. 3 to 14 pg/m(3)). The LOPE concentrations in snow and seawater ranged from 4356 to 10561 pg/L and from 348 to 8396 pg/L, respectively. The atmospheric particle-bound dry depositions of TCEP ranged from 2 to 12 ng/m(2) /day. The air seawater gas exchange fluxes were dominated by net volatilization from seawater to air for TCEP (mean, 146 239 ng/tri(2) /day), TCPP (mean, 1670 +/- 3031 ng/m(2) /day), TiBP (mean, 537 581 ng/m(2) /day) and TnBP (mean, 230 +/- 254 ng/m(2) /clay).

40|$|The {{process of}} characterizing human {{exposure}} to particulate matter requires information on both particle concentrations in microenvironments and the time-specific activity budgets of individuals among these microenvironments. Because {{the average amount}} of time spent indoors by individuals in the US is estimated to be greater than 75 %, accurate characterization of particle concentrations indoors is critical to exposure assessments for the US population. In addition, it is estimated that indoor particle concentrations depend strongly on outdoor concentrations. The spatial and temporal variations of indoor particle concentrations as well as the factors that affect these variations are important to health scientists. For them, knowledge of the factors that control the relationship of indoor particle concentrations to outdoor levels is particularly important. In this report, we identify and evaluate sources of data for those factors that affect the transport to and concentration of outdoor particles in the indoor environment. Concentrations of particles indoors depend upon the fraction of outdoor particles that penetrate through the building shell or are <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> the <b>air</b> handling (HVAC) system, the generation of particles by indoor sources, and the loss mechanisms that occur indoors, such as deposition. To address these issues, we (i) identify and assemble relevant information including the behavior of particles during air leakage, HVAC operations, and particle filtration; (ii) review and evaluate the assembled information to distinguish data that are directly relevant to specific estimates of particle transport from those that are only indirectly useful and (iii) provide a synthesis of the currently available information on building air-leakage parameters and their effect on indoor particle matter concentrations...|$|R
