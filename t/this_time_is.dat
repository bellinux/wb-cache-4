5|$|The {{history of}} Orkney prior to <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> largely {{the history of}} the ruling aristocracy. From now on the {{ordinary}} people emerge with greater clarity. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.|$|E

The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E

5|$|Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, {{about native}} British saints survive {{from the period}} of the mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons. Most of the information about the British church at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> concerned with the western regions of the island of Great Britain and does not deal with the Gregorian missionaries. Other sources of information include Bede's chronologies, the set of laws issued by Æthelberht in Kent, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was compiled in the late 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Britain from <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> now {{beneath the}} sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, recovered from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been recovered from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was recovered dating from between 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been recovered from Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{resemble}} several edible species commonly {{consumed by}} humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can {{be confused with the}} edible A. velosa, A. lanei or Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible Agaricus mushrooms or puffballs. Similar in toxicity to the death cap (A. phalloides) and destroying angels of Europe (A. virosa) and eastern North America (A. bisporigera), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California. Its principal toxic constituent, α-amanitin, damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally, and has no known antidote, though silybin and N-acetylcysteine show promise. The initial symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. These subside temporarily after 2–3days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> common; symptoms of jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma may follow with death from liver failure 6–16days post ingestion.|$|E

Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop {{with the consent}} of King Æthelred. Information on Wilfrid's life at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> meagre, as the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says little of this period. He is {{generally}} considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham. Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the Frisians, which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more successful than his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of Man, were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited.

5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while mounted. The main goal during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> also apparent from {{the titles of}} two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, {{a series of articles}} on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.|$|E
5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} of the Gaelic kingdoms of Dál Riata in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after Áed mac Boanta. The Frankish Annales Bertiniani may record the conquest of the Inner Hebrides, the seaward part of Dál Riata, by Northmen in 849. In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the Western Isles or the Northern Isles at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> debated.|$|E

5|$|Under Edward I, {{the massive}} {{gatehouse}} {{was built to}} protect the castle entrance, including special protection against undermining. There has been speculation that the royal architect James of Saint George may {{have been responsible for}} the building work, which occurred between 1292–3 at a cost of £477. The reason for the king extending the castle at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> unclear, as the castle was relatively far from the Welsh border and in no particular risk of attack. One popular explanation is that given the quantities of weapons and money being stored at the property by this time, the gatehouse was designed to improve the internal security of the castle; the presence of the additional portcullises would also support this explanation. In 1300, the old wooden chapel was rebuilt in stone and in 1310, an extension to the castle wall was constructed at a cost of £40; called 'the Peel', this followed the line of the old motte and gave additional protection to the keep.|$|E
5|$|Wiglaf (died 839) was King of Mercia from 827 to 829 {{and again}} from 830 until his death. His ancestry is uncertain: the 820s were {{a period of}} dynastic {{conflict}} within Mercia and the genealogy {{of several of the}} kings of <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Wigstan, his grandson, was later recorded as a descendant of Penda of Mercia, so it is possible that Wiglaf was descended from Penda, {{one of the most powerful}} seventh-century kings of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first the base is prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, {{but it can also}} be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated with a variety of methods. In the maki-e technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> the earliest lacquer artist known by name.|$|E
