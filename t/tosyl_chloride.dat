50|$|Diaziridines can be {{prepared}} from ketones by oximation, followed by tosylation (or mesylation), and then finally by treatment with ammonia. Generally, oximation reactions are performed by reacting the ketone with hydroxylammonium chloride under heat {{in the presence of}} a base such as pyridine. Subsequent tosylation or mesylation of the alpha substituted oxygen with <b>tosyl</b> or mesyl <b>chloride</b> in the presence of base yields the tosyl or mesyl oxime. The final treatment of the tosyl or mesyl oxime with ammonia produces the diaziridine. Alternatively, diaziridines can be produced directly by the reaction of ketones with ammonia {{in the presence of a}}n aminating agent such as a chloramine or hydroxyl amine O-sulfonic acid.|$|R
50|$|For SN2 reactions, alkyl {{alcohols}} {{can also}} be converted to alkyl tosylates, often through addition of <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> In this reaction, the lone pair of the alcohol oxygen attacks the sulfur of the <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> kicking off the chloride group and forming the tosylate with retention of reactant stereochemistry. This is useful because alcohols are poor leaving groups in SN2 reactions, {{in contrast to the}} tosylate group. It is the transformation of alkyl alcohols to alkyl tosylates that allows an SN2 reaction to occur {{in the presence of a}} good nucleophile.|$|E

50|$|Volatile acyl halides are lachrymatory {{because they}} can react with water at {{the surface of the}} eye {{producing}} hydrohalic and organic acids irritating to the eye.

50|$|The general {{method for}} the {{formation}} of isothiocyanates proceeds through the reaction between a primary amine (e.g. aniline) and carbon disulfide in aqueous ammonia. This results in precipitation of the ammonium dithiocarbamate salt, which is then treated with lead nitrate to yield the corresponding isothiocyanate.Another method relies on a <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> mediated decomposition of dithiocarbamate salts that are generated in the first step above.|$|E
50|$|The {{part of the}} {{structure}} coming from (1) is based on paracetamol.A synthesis is available which relates the absolute configuration of the more potent optical isomer to (+)-lactic acid. The glycerol derivative (2) is available from D-mannitol and retains optical activity as the two 1° alcohol functions are differentially protected. Displacement with sodium p-acetamidophenoxide (1, deprotonated paracetamol) gives 3 which is deprotected with dilute acid, the primary alcohol function is selectively reacted with one molar equivalent of <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and pyridine, then treated with NaOH in dimethylsulfoxide to yield 3. Epoxide opening with isopropylamine leads to optically active prolactolol (4).|$|E
50|$|Cyclen {{compounds}} can be synthesized {{by combining}} two separate parts by nucleophilic displacement. In this procedure the terminal amine groups in diethylene triamine (1) are activated as amine anionic nucleophiles by reaction with <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> in pyridine to the N-tosyl protective group followed by proton abstraction with sodium ethoxide. The alcohol end groups in diethanolamine (2) are activated as electrophile by converting them into tosyl leaving groups. The two segments are joined in dimethylformamide and unless the reactants are very diluted, ordinary polymerization {{will take place}} to long linear chains and not cyclization. In the final step the tosyl groups are removed with sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|Hydrazides {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} are {{a class of}} organic compounds sharing a common functional group characterized by a nitrogen to nitrogen covalent bond with 4 substituents {{with at least one}} of them being an acyl group. The general structure for a hydrazide is E(=O)-NR-NR2, where the Rs are frequently hydrogens. Hydrazides can be further classified by atom attached to the oxygen: carbohydrazides (R-C(=O)-NH-NH2), sulfonohydrazides (R-S(=O)2-NH-NH2), and phosphonic dihydrazides (R-P(=O)(-NH-NH2)2. The related hydrazines do not carry an acyl group. Some important members of this class are sulfonylhydrazides such as p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide which are useful reagents in organic chemistry such as in the Shapiro reaction and the Eschenmoser-Tanabe fragmentation. This reagent can be prepared by reaction of <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> with hydrazine.|$|E
50|$|Reduction of {{the double}} bonds in 13 to 14 is {{accomplished}} with hydrogenation with palladium on carbon {{and that of the}} ketone groups to alcohol groups in 15 by sodium borohydride. Replacement of hydroxyl by chlorine in 17 via nucleophilic aliphatic substitution takes place through the dilactone 16 (<b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride).</b> The first C-C bond forming reaction is a kind of Birch alkylation (lithium, ammonia) with the immediate reaction product trapped with chloromethyl phenyl ether, the other chlorine atom in 17 is simply reduced. This temporary appendix will in a later stage prevent unwanted enolization. The newly formed ketone group then forms another C-C bond by photochemical Norrish reaction to 19 whose alcohol group is induced to eliminate with TsOH to alkene 20.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the very}} first dendrimers, the Newkome dendrimer, was {{synthesized}} in 1985. This macromolecule is also commonly known by the name arborol. The figure outlines the mechanism of the first two generations of arborol through a divergent route (discussed below). The synthesis is started by nucleophilic substitution of 1-bromopentane by triethyl sodiomethanetricarboxylate in dimethylformamide and benzene. The ester groups were then reduced by lithium aluminium hydride to a triol in a deprotection step. Activation of the chain ends was achieved by converting the alcohol groups to tosylate groups with <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and pyridine. The tosyl group then served as leaving groups in another reaction with the tricarboxylate, forming generation two. Further repetition of the two steps leads to higher generations of arborol.|$|E
50|$|Some spiro {{compounds}} can be synthesized {{using the}} Pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement; for example, spiro5.4decane (final compound in following two line scheme) can be synthesized from symmetric 1,2-diols {{of the sort}} shown below this route's starting material, (1,1′-bicyclopentyl)-1,1′-diol. Initially, one of the carbinol moieties is protonated, allowing water to leave, and yielding the corresponding carbocation (second structure, first row); this intermediate then undergoes a bond migration, resulting in ring expansion of the adjacent ring, with deprotionation unmasking the ketone functional group to complete {{the first line of}} the mechanism. This first product, a spirobicyclic ketone, is a spiro compound in its own right, and yields the further spiro carbinol and the alicyclic spiro hydrocarbon after two further reduction reactions. First, reduction of the carbonyl that ends the mechanism's first line provides the spiro carbinol starting material of the second line, which is needed for reduction to the alkane (shown). This latter reduction is accomplished using lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), via the alcohol tosylate (formed using <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride).</b> Hence this three reaction sequence provides three spiro compounds (ketone, alcohol, and alkane), of possible research or practical use.|$|E

Chitosan was phthaloylated selectively using phthalic anhydride in dimethylformamide as solvent with addition of 5 % water (v/v) as cosolvent prior to be tosylated. N-phthaloyl-chitosan and HA were tosylated using <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> in excess and triethylamine as catalyst at temperature < 10 °C for 12 h.

The HA immobilized onto chitosan was characterized by XRD and FTIR spectrophotometric method. The result showed that HA can be immobilized covalently onto chitosan after attaching 1, 4 -butanediol as spacer arm onto 6 -O-tosyl-N-phthaloyl-chitosan and activating the product with <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> but HA cannot be reacted directly onto 6 -O-tosyl-N-phthaloyl-chitosan...|$|E

40|$|A {{selective}} debromination of tetracyclic dibrominated bis-γ-lactones in {{the presence}} of triethylamine and mesyl chloride is reported. Both mesyl chloride and triethylamine are essential for the debromination process. The reduction is proposed to proceed through halophilic substitution of electrophilic bromine. The source of the halophile in this reaction is believed to be triethyl(mesyl) ammonium chloride. The nonoccurrence of debromination in dibromo bis-γ-lactones with <b>tosyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and triethylamine as reagents suggests that the formation of a source of well-dissociated chloride ions during the reaction is necessary. Furthermore, selective debromination of dibrominated bis-γ-lactones was also achieved by using pyridine–thionyl chloride as a reagent.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of well-defined polymer architectures is of major {{importance for the}} development of complex functional materials. In this contribution, we discuss the {{synthesis of}} a range of multifunctional star-shaped tosylates as potential initiators for the living cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of 2 -oxazolines resulting in star-shaped polymers.
