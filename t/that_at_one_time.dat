5|$|The 19th-century {{historian}} Theodor Mommsen compiled {{and described}} in detail the various elements <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era. The following paragraph is based on that description, {{it is not to}} be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written {{over a period of several}} centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> the manuscript {{was in the}} possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a paleographer at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{main house}} {{protected}} John McQueen's family and neighbors during attacks from invading Creeks in 1802; he wrote <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> 26 people took refuge there.

When Kingsley arrived, there were no metal fixtures in the doors and the wooden slave quarters had been burned down. John Rollins added sections to the east and west sides of the house in between the pavilions in the 1890s and removed at least three of the fireplace chimneys from the pavilions. One of the clubs that owned the island in the 1920s added electricity.|$|E

25|$|Diefenbaker Park - {{located at}} the {{intersection}} of 56th Street and 1st Avenue, named after former Canadian prime minister John Diefenbaker in 1976, prior to the park's completion in 1980. One of the largest parks in the area, it has many features - open spaces and large hills, a waterfall, dock, and pond, a very large forest, playgrounds, restrooms, and many gardens. The steep grade from the surrounding streets into the centre of the park makes it especially popular during Tsawwassen's rare snow falls, for sledding and tobogganing. In Summer 2011, the Rotary WaterWorks Playground was built. This water playground was created with environmentally friendly materials. The WaterWorks project was a collaborative partnership of the Corporation of Delta and the Rotary Club of Tsawwassen. The concept draws {{on the history of the}} site, a former gravel mining operation <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> supplied much of the gravel for the development of Tsawwassen.|$|E
25|$|After the {{establishment}} of the State of Israel in 1948, Israel was subjected to Arab League boycotts and attempts to diplomatically isolate the state. Today, Israel has diplomatic ties with 157 out of the other 192 member states of the United Nations as well as with non-member Holy See (Vatican City) and the European Union. Some states recognize Israel as a state, but have no diplomatic relations. Several countries once had diplomatic relations with Israel, but have since broken or suspended them (Bolivia, Cuba, and Venezuela in Latin America; Mauritania in the Arab League; Chad, Mali and Niger in non-Arab Africa; and Iran until the Islamic revolution). Some of these countries have since resumed relations. In addition, a number of countries (all members of the Arab League) <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>time</b> had formal economic ties (primarily trade offices) with Israel that fell short of full diplomatic relations, have severed such ties (Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Tunisia).|$|E
