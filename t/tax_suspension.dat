40|$|Recent {{energy price}} {{increases}} have revitalized interest in energy’s impact on state economies. Moreover, lackluster {{economic growth in}} most states prompted some to suspend gas tax collections to stimulate economic activity. Given such interest, surprisingly few studies have quantified the effect energy has on state economies. Two questions are thus addressed here: 1) what {{is the impact of}} higher energy prices on state employment and 2) what is the impact of a gas <b>tax</b> <b>suspension.</b> We find that the impact of increased petroleum-based energy prices on employment growth is small, calling into question the efficacy of a gas <b>tax</b> <b>suspension...</b>|$|E
40|$|There are {{surprisingly}} few {{estimates of the}} effects of sales taxes on retail prices, especially at the firm level. We consider the temporary suspension, and subsequent reinstatement, of the gasoline sales tax in Illinois and Indiana following a price spike in 2000. Earlier laws set the timing of the reinstatements, providing plausibly exogenous changes in the tax rates. Using a unique dataset of daily prices at the gas-station level, 70 % of the <b>tax</b> <b>suspension</b> is passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, while 80 - 100 % of the tax reinstatements are passed on to consumers. Some evidence suggests that these short-run pass-through estimates are smaller near the state borders, with the tax reinstatements associated with relatively higher prices up to an hour's drive into neighboring states. ...|$|E

500|$|The privations of {{the siege}} {{led to an}} exodus of the city's population, as {{citizens}} {{with the ability to}} leave sold their possessions and fled to Constantinople, other Venetian-controlled Greek territories, or to the Turks. Contemporary Italian sources estimate that only 10,000–13,000 people were left in the city by 1429–1430, down from a reported population of 20,000–25,000. The Venetian authorities tried {{to put a stop to}} this by prohibiting the inhabitants from leaving the city, outlawing [...] "all sales, mortgages, and transfers of property, both movable and immovable", and destroying the houses and other property—even trees—of people who had left the city. They hoped that the destruction would serve a deterrent to those who remained behind. Coupled with several instances of arbitrariness, speculation, and profiteering on behalf of the Venetian authorities, these measures helped to further alienate the Thessalonians. By April 1425, a Byzantine church official who had had his family flee the city wrote of the [...] "enslavement of the city by the Venetians", and similar sentiments about Venetian tyranny are echoed in all contemporary Byzantine sources. In their embassy in July 1425, the Thessalonians submitted a list of 21 complaints and demands, including fixed rations of corn for the poor, the lowering of <b>tax</b> dues and <b>suspension</b> of arrears and debt-related punishments for the duration of the siege, since the closing of the gates meant that people could no longer access their fields, which were furthermore destroyed by the Turks. In a session on 23 July 1425, the Great Council acceded to many of their demands and requested that its officials respect the customs and rights of the citizens and work together with the local council of twelve nobles in the governance of the city.|$|R
40|$|Mid-Ming times {{witnessed}} {{the rise of}} Neo-Confucianized merchants in Huizhou. The combined effort of Cheng surnamed merchants and the prestigious scholar-official Cheng Minzheng revived the trend of lineage construction in a recognizable pattern. First, the branch Shi Zhong temples were made {{to be used as}} ancestral halls of the Chengs. Then, multi-volume genealogies of enlarged kinships were compiled to form conglomerated lineages. The climax of this lineage-building process was the publication of the Conglomerated Lineage of the Chengs of Huizhou (Xin'an Chengshi tongzong shipu) compiled by Cheng Minzheng in 1482. This work created a constructed lineage but also realized a long cherished social ideal of the Confucian scholar. The local merchants were enthusiastic about such lineage-building activities, because the lineage itself facilitated their commercial enterprises and the building of it lessened the social tension brought about by their pursuit of profit. The founding of the Ming dynasty influenced Huizhou in two ways. First, powerful families rising from Yuan times were weakened during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns. Consequently, Neo-Confucian social practices local elites supported such as lineage construction became inactive. Second, the Ming pursued a state policy of regulating local cults. Of the many local gods in Huizhou, only Wang Hua and Cheng Lingxi became legitimate gods recognized by the state. As a result, the Shi Zhong (everlasting loyalty) Temple worshiping Cheng Lingxi became an official temple in Huizhou. In time, branch Shi Zhong temples appeared in many areas in Huizhou and nearby regions. The Mongolian conquest of China saw new social mobility in Huizhou. A group of new power holders arose because of the new regime's recruitment policy, which emphasized the appointee's class background and ability to collect <b>taxes.</b> The <b>suspension</b> of civil examinations in early Yuan times drove a large number of Confucian office-aspirants to become teachers in rural schools. These literati, however, helped spread Neo-Confucianism more widely than before. By late Yuan times, the new power holders in Huizhou also absorbed Neo-Confucianism and put it into practice in the construction of lineage halls and in the compilation of genealogies. Neo-Confucianism became socialized. The study analyzes the various elements that made the Cheng lineage and defines these elements in the historical context of Huizhou from the Southern Song to the mid-Ming. Crucial elements include the rise of Cheng Lingxi, a famous warlord in sixth century. Cheng Lingxi was rewarded an official title by the Southern Song dynasty for which he became an authoritative god in early Ming times. Huizhou prefecture assumed increasing importance in Southern Song times because of its proximity to the capital at Lin'an. It became a communication hub for metropolitan Lin'an and the inland areas. Local government in Huizhou was strengthened and elites there entered the political center through civil examinations. Zhu Xi and his version of Neo-Confucianism were also well received there in late Southern Song times when both became orthodox. This dissertation studies the construction process of the conglomerate lineage of the Chengs in Huizhou prefecture in mid-Ming China. This organization used the rule of decent-line to unite the families bearing the surname of Cheng and maintained the unity by means of genealogies and ancestral halls. The emergence of the conglomerated Cheng lineage bespeaks the emergence of a Neo-Confucian order jointly built by literati-officials and rising merchants in mid-Ming Huizhou. 章毅. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2006. 參考文獻(p. 232 - 241).
