5|$|The Last Remnant {{was created}} by {{developers}} who had previously worked on games in the SaGa and Final Fantasy series. It was directed by Hiroshi Takai and produced by Nobuyuki Ueda. The game was written by Masato Yagi and Miwa Shoda whose work {{was based on a}} scenario concept by executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu. Kimihiko Miyamae was the chief artist, while Yusuke Naora served as both art producer and character designer. The game was the first game by Square Enix to use the Unreal Engine 3. Because they used a licensed engine rather than making their own, the production time it took to see graphical resources onscreen was cut significantly, allowing the team to begin illustrating and experimenting at an early stage. The decision to use a licensed engine, rather than develop their own as was traditional at Square Enix, was made due to concerns in the company of the rising production costs of making a game, and the direct development <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> possible from using an existing engine. Over a year after the game was released, on February 17, 2010, Square-Enix's chief technology officer Julien Merceron claimed in an interview that most of the game's perceived technical shortcomings were caused by a decision to use the Unreal Engine to try to replace having as many skilled programmers as would be used otherwise.|$|E

30|$|For {{complexity}} {{control of}} the frame layer, {{it is important to}} maintain good rate distortion performance. In the proposed algorithm, we estimate the actual <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the coded frame by considering the difference between the normal coding time of the coded frame and the actual coding time. Then, the following strategies are adopted. (1) If the sum of the actual <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of already coded frames is greater than the target <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the entire sequence, normal coding is carried out in time to avoid degradation of the rate distortion performance. (2) When the sum of actual <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the coded frames is less than the target <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the entire sequence, the remaining frames still need to be encoded under control. (3) When the actual <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the previous frame is much greater than the target <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the previous frame, the degree of {{control of the}} current frame needs to be reduced. Therefore, the current frame only uses the CSD method to save the coding time and achieve better rate distortion performance.|$|R

25|$|On October 9, 1958, {{because of}} a lack of funds and because of {{community}} opposition, the City Planning Commission removed the project from the capital outlay budget. On July 14, 1959, the third-track project was put into the New York City Transit Authority's 1960 budget. On August 18, 1959, the New York City Transit Authority through an appeal made by the Authority's chairman, Patterson, tried to obtain approval from the City Planning Commission for a $27 million project to construct a third track on the BMT Jamaica Line. The installation of the third track would have attracted passengers from the overcrowded IND Queens Boulevard Line, as there would be significant <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> between 168th Street and Marcy Avenue.

25|$|In 2003, {{money was}} {{allocated}} {{for the construction}} of a new station at South Ferry, and in 2005, construction commenced on the new station.

Because of the curve at the station gap fillers are required, and as a result the new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station.|$|E

25|$|Two more {{electrification}} {{projects were}} undertaken under state ownership. Third rail electrification was extended on the Main Line and Port Jefferson Branch from Mineola to Hicksville and Huntington on October 19, 1970, after being started in 1968. This {{was the first}} time in 43 years that electrified service was extended to previously non-third rail territory. The Main Line beyond Hicksville (where the Port Jefferson Branch splits) to Ronkonkoma (also known as the Ronkonkoma Branch) was fully electrified in December 1987, however, in 1987 there was interim electric service to Farmingdale. The improvement extended electrified service a full 50 miles east of Manhattan to Suffolk County's central corridor communities of Wyandanch, Deer Park, Brentwood, Central Islip, and Ronkonkoma. New electric service was also added to two station in Nassau County; Bethpage and Farmingdale. Peak period running times between Ronkonkoma and Penn Station were reduced to 60 minutes from 93 minutes. This <b>time</b> <b>savings</b> led to an increase in ridership on the Ronkonkoma Branch. In 2007, ridership on the branch had increased from 6,200 to 16,000 passenger trips every day, equaling a 150 percent increase. The Ronkonkoma Branch then became the second largest branch in total ridership after the Babylon Branch. In 1985, a second electrified track was built between Syosset and Huntington on the Port Jefferson Branch in order to eliminate a single track bottleneck. This helped boost ridership pn the branch. Further extensions of electrification (to stations such as Port Jefferson, Yaphank, Patchogue or Speonk) have been seriously considered from time to time, but no such short-term capital budget actions are currently contemplated.|$|E

Instead, he elected to shoot American Graffiti using two cinematographers (as he had done in THX 1138) and no formal director of photography. Two cameras were used simultaneously in scenes involving conversations between actors in different cars, which resulted in significant production <b>time</b> <b>savings.</b> After CinemaScope proved to be too expensive, Lucas decided that American Graffiti should have a documentary-like feel, and shot the film using Techniscope cameras.

Adding to the documentary feel was Lucas's openness for the cast to improvise scenes. He also used goofs for the final cut, notably Charles Martin Smith's arriving on his scooter to meet Steve outside Mel's Drive-In. Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage were hired as the cinematographers, but filming with Techniscope cameras brought lighting problems.

40|$|Due to {{the innate}} {{complexity}} of the task drivers have to manage multiple goals while driving {{and the importance of}} certain goals may vary over time leading to priority being given to different goals depending on the circumstances. This study aimed to investigate drivers' behavioral regulation while managing multiple goals during driving. To do so participants drove on urban and rural roads in a driving simulator while trying to manage fuel <b>saving</b> and <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> goals, besides the safety goals that are always present during driving. A between-subjects design was used with one group of drivers managing two goals (safety and fuel saving) and another group managing three goals (safety, fuel <b>saving,</b> and <b>time</b> <b>saving)</b> while driving. Participants were provided continuous feedback on the fuel saving goal via a meter on the dashboard. The results indicate that even when a fuel <b>saving</b> or <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> goal is salient, safety goals are still given highest priority when interactions with other road users take place and when interacting with a traffic light. Additionally, performance on the fuel saving goal diminished for the group that had to manage fuel <b>saving</b> and <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> together. The theoretical implications for a goal hierarchy in driving tasks and practical implications for eco-driving are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, the {{computational}} {{complexity of}} the HM 9.0 encoder was analyzed for acceleration and parallelization of the HEVC encoder. We identified five key modules for the HM 9.0 encoder, requiring dominant computing cycles. Based on the complexity analysis, two software optimization methods were used for acceleration: the frame-level interpolation filter and SIMD implementation. In addition, load-balanced slice parallelization is proposed. Software optimization methods achieve 33.56 % of the average <b>time</b> <b>saving,</b> with any coding loss. In addition, load balancing for the slice parallelization method achieves about 10 % of average <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> compared to uniform slice partition. The overall average <b>time</b> <b>saving</b> of the proposed HEVC encoder yields approximately 90 % compared to HM 9.0 with acceptable coding loss. HEVC encoder with the proposed methods can compress full HD videos at approximately 1 fps speed in a commercial PC environment, without any hardware acceleration.|$|R
