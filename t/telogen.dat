5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair or longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and <b>telogen</b> (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E
25|$|Hair {{follows a}} {{specific}} growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen, catagen, and <b>telogen</b> phases. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine {{the length of}} the hair. All three phases occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the <b>telogen</b> phase.|$|E
25|$|PFOA is also {{synthesized}} by the telomerization represented below, {{where the}} <b>telogen</b> is the organoiodine compound and the taxogen is the unsaturated tetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} change in the hair cycle. There are three stages of the hair cycle: the anagen phase (hair growth), the catagen phase (hair follicle death), and the <b>telogen</b> phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases beyond what is normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy induced {{hair loss}} occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can {{manifest}} as alopecia totalis, <b>telogen</b> effluvium, or less often alopecia areata. It is {{usually associated with}} systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss, although permanent cases can occur. Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.|$|E
25|$|At some point, the {{follicle}} {{will begin}} to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft {{will begin to}} emerge once the <b>telogen</b> phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>telogen</b> or resting phase the {{follicle}} remains dormant {{for one to}} four months. Ten {{to fifteen}} percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth at any given time. In this phase the epidermal cells lining the follicle channel continue to grow as normal and may accumulate {{around the base of}} the hair, temporarily anchoring it in place and preserving the hair for its natural purpose without taxing the body's resources needed during the growth phase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{three stages}} of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and <b>telogen</b> phases. Each {{strand of hair}} on {{the human body is}} at its own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The rate or speed of hair growth is about 1.25{{centimetres}} or 0.5inches [...] per month, or about 15 centimetres [...] or 6inches per year.|$|E
2500|$|Human hair follicles {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to the effects of radiation therapy administered to the head, most commonly used to treat cancerous growths within the brain. [...] Hair shedding may start as soon as two weeks after the first dose of radiation and will continue for a couple of weeks. [...] Hair follicles typically enter the resting <b>telogen</b> phase and regrowth should commence 2.5 to 3 months after the hair begins to shed. [...] Regrowth may be sparser after treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Alopecia is a {{hair loss}} disease {{that can occur}} in anyone at any stage of life. [...] Specifically Alopecia areata is an {{autoimmune}} disease that causes hair to spontaneously fall out. It is mainly characterized by bald patches on the scalp or {{other parts of the}} body, and can ultimately cause baldness across the entire body. This disease interferes with the hair growth cycle by causing a follicle to prematurely leave the anagen, or active growth, phase and enter the resting, or <b>telogen</b> phase. [...] The hair growth in the affected follicles is lessened or stopped completely.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Telogen phase=== The <b>telogen</b> {{phase is}} the resting {{phase of the}} hair follicle. When the body is {{subjected}} to extreme stress, as much as 70 percent of hair can prematurely enter the <b>telogen</b> phase and begin to fall, causing a noticeable loss of hair. This condition is called <b>telogen</b> effluvium. The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the <b>telogen</b> stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair. [...] Fifty to one-hundred club hair are shed daily from a normal scalp.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>telogen,</b> hair growth stops, the {{follicle}} rests, {{and the old}} hair falls off—is shed. At {{the end of the}} <b>telogen</b> phase, the follicle {{begins the}} cycle again.|$|E
50|$|Common types include: male-pattern hair loss, female-pattern hair loss, {{alopecia}} areata, and a thinning of hair {{known as}} <b>telogen</b> effluvium. The cause of male-pattern hair loss {{is a combination}} of genetics and male hormones, the cause of female pattern hair loss is unclear, the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune, and the cause of <b>telogen</b> effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. <b>Telogen</b> effluvium is very common following pregnancy.|$|E
5000|$|The pluck test is {{conducted}} by pulling hair out [...] "by the roots". The {{root of the}} plucked hair is examined under a microscope to determine the phase of growth, and is used to diagnose a defect of <b>telogen,</b> anagen, or systemic disease. <b>Telogen</b> hairs have tiny bulbs without sheaths at their roots. <b>Telogen</b> effluvium shows an increased percentage of hairs upon examination. Anagen hairs have sheaths attached to their roots. Anagen effluvium shows a decrease in telogen-phase hairs and an increased number of broken hairs.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{follows a}} {{specific}} growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen, catagen, and <b>telogen</b> phases. Each has specific characteristics that determine {{the length of}} the hair. All three occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the <b>telogen</b> phase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Telogen</b> effluvium is a scalp {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} the thinning or shedding of hair resulting from the early entry of hair in the <b>telogen</b> phase (the resting phase of the hair follicle). Emotional or physiological stress may result in an alteration of the normal hair cycle and cause the disorder, with potential causes including eating disorders, fever, childbirth, chronic illness, major surgery, anemia, severe emotional disorders, crash diets, hypothyroidism, and drugs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{larger number}} of grafts can {{compensate}} for the shedding that frequently accompanies a hair transplant, called <b>telogen</b> effluvium, ...|$|E
50|$|PFOA is also {{synthesized}} by the telomerization represented below, {{where the}} <b>telogen</b> is the organoiodine compound and the taxogen is the unsaturated tetrafluoroethylene.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 S.Inui {{published}} a trichoscopy algorithm, which allows differential diagnosis of most common hair and scalp diseases (including alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, <b>telogen</b> effluvium and cicatricial alopecia) based on trichoscopy.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{grows in}} several phases (anagen, <b>telogen,</b> catagen) and a laser can only affect the {{currently}} active growing hair follicles (early anagen). Hence, several sessions {{are needed to}} kill hair in all phases of growth.|$|E
50|$|Telomerization is {{a radical}} {{polymerization}} reaction where a chain transfer limits {{the size of the}} oligomer molecule product—the telomer. Telomerization requires a <b>telogen</b> to react with at least one unsaturated taxogen molecule. Fluorotelomers are an example.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{grows in}} cycles of various phases: anagen is the growth phase; catagen is the involuting or regressing phase; and <b>telogen,</b> the resting or {{quiescent}} phase (names derived using the Greek prefixes ana-, kata-, and telos- meaning up, down, and end respectively). Each phase has several morphologically and histologically distinguishable sub-phases. Prior {{to the start}} of cycling is a phase of follicular morphogenesis (formation of the follicle). There is also a shedding phase, or exogen, that is independent of anagen and <b>telogen</b> in which one or several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exits. Normally up to 90% of the hair follicles are in anagen phase, while 10-14% are in <b>telogen</b> and 1-2% in catagen. The cycle's length varies on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, the cycle is completed in around 4 months, while it takes the scalp 3-4 years to finish; this is the reason eyebrow hair have a much shorter length limit compared to hair on the head. Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor. DLX3 is a crucial regulator of hair follicle differentiation and cycling. Specifically, colocalization of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 complex and DLX3 regulate role for BMP signaling to Dlx3 during hair morphogenesis in animal models.|$|E
5000|$|Dermatologic conditions: {{there are}} {{multiple}} types of dermatological conditions that can result in madarosis. These include Atopic dermatitis, Seborrhoeic dermatitis atopic dermatitis, and Psoriasis on the eyelids can result in madarosis. Others include: frontal fibrosing alopecia, ulerythema ophryogenes, acne rosacea, <b>telogen</b> effluvium, follicular mucinosis,and cutaneous sarcoidosis.|$|E
5000|$|Nutritional defects: Severe {{malnutrition}} {{can cause}} chronic hair loss. Hypoproteinemia causes hair loss by early onset of <b>telogen.</b> Zinc deficiencies like acrodermatitis enteropathica, {{can lead to}} the loss of eyebrow/eyelash hair. Other deficiencies like biotin and iron make it possible for loss of hair as well.|$|E
5000|$|Gradual {{thinning}} of {{hair with}} {{age is a}} natural condition known as involutional alopecia. This is caused by {{an increasing number of}} hair follicles switching from the growth, or anagen, phase into a resting phase, or <b>telogen</b> phase, so that remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number.|$|E
50|$|A hair {{follicle}} is a mammalian skin organ that produces hair. Hair production occurs in phases, including growth (anagen), cessation (catagen), and rest (<b>telogen)</b> phases. Stem cells {{are responsible for}} hair production. The shape of the {{hair follicle}} {{has an effect on}} the hair shape and texture of the individual's hair.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{follicle}} growth {{occurs in}} cycles. Each cycle {{consists of a}} long growing phase (anagen), a short transitional phase (catagen) and a short resting phase (<b>telogen).</b> At {{the end of the}} resting phase, the hair falls out (exogen) and a new hair starts growing in the follicle beginning the cycle again.|$|E
5000|$|Normally, {{about 40}} (0-78 in men) hairs {{reach the end}} of their resting phase each day and fall out. [...] When more than 100 hairs fall out per day, {{clinical}} hair loss (<b>telogen</b> effluvium) may occur. A disruption of the growing phase causes abnormal loss of anagen hairs (anagen effluvium).|$|E
50|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} change in the hair cycle. There are three stages of the hair cycle: the anagen phase (hair growth), the catagen phase (hair follicle death), and the <b>telogen</b> phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases beyond what is normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.|$|E
5000|$|Androgenic hair {{follows the}} same growth pattern as the hair that grows on the scalp, {{but with a}} shorter anagen phase and longer <b>telogen</b> phase. While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the {{androgenic}} hair growing phase lasts a few months. [...] The <b>telogen</b> phase for body hair lasts close to a year. [...] This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why {{the hair on the}} head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body. Differences in length seen in comparing the {{hair on the back of}} the hand and pubic hair, for example, can be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions. The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when comparing men and women.|$|E
50|$|A biopsy {{is rarely}} {{needed to make}} the {{diagnosis}} or aid in the management of alopecia areata. Histologic findings include peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate ("swarm of bees"). Occasionally, in inactive alopecia areata, no inflammatory infiltrates are found. Other helpful findings include pigment incontinence in the hair bulb and follicular stelae, and a shift in the anagen-to-telogen ratio towards <b>telogen.</b>|$|E
50|$|At some point, the {{follicle}} {{will begin}} to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks the new hair shaft {{will begin to}} emerge once the <b>telogen</b> phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding.|$|E
50|$|Diagnostic tests, {{which may}} be {{performed}} to verify the diagnosis, include a trichogram, trichoscopy and biopsy. Effluvium can present with similar appearance to alopecia totalis, with further distinction by clinical course, microscopic examination of plucked follicles, or biopsy of the scalp. Histology would show <b>telogen</b> hair follicles in the dermis with minimal inflammation in effluvium, and dense peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate in alopecia totalis.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy induced {{hair loss}} occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can {{manifest}} as alopecia totalis, <b>telogen</b> effluvium, or less often alopecia areata. It is {{usually associated with}} systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss, although permanent cases can occur. Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.|$|E
50|$|Important diagnoses to {{consider}} include female pattern hair loss (FPHL), chronic <b>telogen</b> effluvium (CTE), and alopecia areata (AA). FPHL is a non-scarring progressive miniaturization {{of the hair}} follicle with one of three different characteristic patterns. CTE is an idiopathic disease causing increased hair shedding and bi-temporal recession, usually in middle aged women. AA is an autoimmune attack of hair follicles that usually causes hair to fall out in small round patches.|$|E
50|$|The {{three stages}} of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and <b>telogen</b> phases. Each {{strand of hair}} on {{the human body is}} at its own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The rate or speed of hair growth is about 1.25 {{centimetres}} or 0.5 inches per month, or about 15 centimetres or 6 inches per year.|$|E
