5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the {{revenues}} from <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, {{and the work}} may {{have been designed to}} impress the Cornish nobility, with whom Richard had a difficult relationship.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 {{where their}} initial forays were against the {{south-western}} coastal Kotte kingdom due to <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> monopoly on trade in spices that the Kotte kingdom enjoyed {{that was also}} {{of interest to the}} Portuguese. The Jaffna kingdom {{came to the attention of}} Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities, (which was assumed to be patronizing Portuguese interests) and their support to anti-Portuguese factions of the Kotte kingdom, such as the chieftains from Sittawaka. The Jaffna Kingdom also functioned as a logistical base for the Kandyan kingdom, located in the central highlands without access to any seaports, as an entrypot for military aid arriving from South India. Further, due to its strategic location, it was feared that the Jaffna kingdom may become a beachhead for the Dutch landings. It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese and even massacred 600-700 Parava Catholics in the island of Mannar. These Catholics were brought from India to Mannar to take over <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings.|$|E
5|$|The Hudson Bay {{expedition}} of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse was {{a series}} of military raids on <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> fur trading posts and fortifications of the Hudson's Bay Company on the shores of Hudson Bay by a squadron of the French Royal Navy. Setting sail from Cap-Français in 1782, the expedition was part of a global naval war between France and Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{originally}} resisted funding {{by corporate}} sponsors. It {{was not until}} the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> advertising markets available to them. Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.|$|E
5|$|The artwork took an {{estimated}} {{three months to}} paint, and it was greatly admired at the time. It was also bought for the highest price Millais had received from dealer and publisher Ernest Gambart - <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> sum of 100 guineas. Later, in 1898, William Hesketh Lever purchased the work for his private collection.|$|E
5|$|At the {{concluding}} Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced {{his and his}} descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.|$|E

The titles released by Paramount Pictures and Central Partnership steadily drive high box office.

Moreover, it has become <b>the</b> most <b>lucrative</b> animation of all times in Russia.|$|R
5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese thought that they were entitled to the revenue generated through <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|For his lighter missile troops, Philip II {{employed}} mercenary Cretan archers {{as well as}} Thracian, Paeonian, and Illyrian javelin throwers, slingers, and archers. He hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, {{who were}} capable of building {{state of the art}} siege engines and artillery that fired large bolts. Following the acquisition of <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues under PhilipII allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes.|$|E
5|$|Galba {{may have}} chosen to award Halotus <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> procuratorship {{for any number of}} reasons; during his reign, Galba was known for making often unpopular {{political}} and economical actions, supposedly for what was, at least in Galba's mind, the financial health of the city. Halotus' great rise in status, and his subsequent prosperity, may have been in some way beneficial in Galba's eyes. Less specifically, the move would certainly have had some degree of benefit for Galba in some way, whether indirectly, or directly, economically or financially.|$|E

5|$|Human {{history of}} the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000years, when the first nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} Paleo-Indians began migrating into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies. In the early 19thcentury, the first White explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone natives. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied for control of <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> beaver pelt trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19thcentury as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone, with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the Cherokee Nation {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In {{the early part of}} the century, the Overhill towns' remote location at the far end of the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> fur trade.|$|E
5|$|Suspicious, Skinner {{learns that}} Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate {{son and the}} {{rightful}} heir to the restaurant, which jeopardizes Skinner's control of the restaurant and <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> packaged food enterprise he formed using the restaurant's reputation after Gusteau's death. Remy discovers the evidence of Linguini's inheritance and, after eluding Skinner, gives it to Linguini, who deposes Skinner as owner. The restaurant continues to thrive, and Linguini and Colette develop a budding romance, leaving Remy feeling left out. Remy finds that his clan has come to Paris as well, and is taken to their new lair, but despite his father Django's attempts to rid his son of his admiration of humans, Remy leaves.|$|E

5|$|The B's use of {{electrification}} {{instead of}} steam {{power in a}} Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, marked the first use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to steam power in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|The {{exclusive}} location, <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> contract terms, {{the investor}} list, {{and a close}} personal relationship between a managing partner of the restaurant and the Chicago Park District's project manager led to a formal ethics investigation, court litigation, and extensive press coverage, and ranked among the most prominent scandals of the administration of Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2005. The more than 80 investors include some of Daley's friends and neighbors. One of the most financially successful restaurants in Chicago, the Park Grill remains exempt from property taxes after a multi-year litigation which reached the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and whaling ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island {{and across the}} Pacific, including many from the American whaling fleet, so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a future in <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> whaling industry. Whale oil was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} whaling industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E

5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|The tulip was {{different}} from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal color that no other plant had. The appearance of the nonpareil tulip as a status symbol at this time coincides {{with the rise of}} newly independent Holland's trade fortunes. No longer the Spanish Netherlands, its economic resources could now be channeled into commerce and the country embarked on its Golden Age. Amsterdam merchants were at the center of <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> East Indies trade, where one voyage could yield profits of 400%.|$|E
5|$|When Nike {{took over}} from Adidas as Arsenal's kit {{provider}} in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since {{the advent of}} <b>the</b> <b>lucrative</b> replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.|$|E
