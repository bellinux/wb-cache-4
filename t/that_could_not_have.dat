5|$|The 1965 Tiger Mark I {{gained some}} {{exposure}} on American television {{as the car}} of choice for Maxwell Smart in the spoof spy series Get Smart. The Tiger {{was used for the}} first two seasons in the opening credits, in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters, and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes.

5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E

Other authors have argued that previous 20th-century European visitors to the Dogon are a far more plausible source of such information, as well as disputing whether Griaule's account accurately describes Dogon myths at all.|$|E

Suspicions about {{the true nature of}} the active compounds in GSEs arose when synthetic additives were found in commercial products. Suspected counterfeit grapefruit seed extracts were adulterated with synthetic preservatives. When preservatives were not present in some of the extracts, laboratory tests found the natural extracts had no natural antimicrobial attributes of their own. Some manufacturers of GSE have stated that their extract has compounds nearly identical to benzethonium chloride, but a 2001 study supervised by chemist G.

25|$|While most {{manufactured}} goods {{would have been}} produced for a local market, {{there is some evidence}} that Birmingham was already a specialised and widely recognised centre of the jewellery trade during the medieval period. An inventory of the personal possessions of the Master of the Knights Templar in England at the time of their suppression in 1308 includes twenty two Birmingham Pieces: small, high value items, possibly jewellery or metal ornaments, that were sufficiently well known to be referred to without explanation as far away as London. In 1343 three Birmingham men were punished for selling base metal items while asserting they were silver, and there is documentary evidence of goldsmiths in the town in 1384 and 1460 – a trade <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been supported purely through local demand in a town of Birmingham's size.|$|E
25|$|Disaster struck on 23 June 2000, {{when the}} iron ore tanker MV Treasure sank between Robben Island and Dassen Island, South Africa. It {{released}} 1,300 tons of fuel oil, causing an unprecedented coastal bird crisis, oiling 19,000 adult penguins {{at the height}} of the best breeding season on record for this vulnerable species. The oiled birds were brought to an abandoned train repair warehouse in Cape Town to be cared for. An additional 19,500 un-oiled penguins were removed from Dassen Island and other areas before they became oiled, and were released about 800 kilometres east of Cape Town, near Port Elizabeth. This gave workers enough time to clean up the oiled waters and shores before the birds could complete their long swim home (which took the penguins between one and three weeks). Some of the penguins were named and radio-tracked as they swam back to their breeding grounds. Tens of thousands of volunteers helped with the rescue and rehabilitation process, which was overseen by IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) and the South African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB), and took more than three months to complete. This was the largest animal rescue event in history; more than 91% of the penguins were successfully rehabilitated and released - an amazing feat <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been accomplished without such a tremendous international response.|$|E
25|$|At {{times when}} a death {{sentence}} is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, {{the first step in}} collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Zheng He is {{explicitly}} {{mentioned in the}} Mingshi in connection to the visits of Ganbali (possibly Coimatore), Lasa, Djorfar, Magadishu, and Brava. Ganbali is in southern India, Lasa and Djorfar is on the southern coast of Arabia, and Magadishu and Brava is in Somalia (Africa). Dreyer (2007) states that the account is unclear on whether he did go to those places in person. The wording in the Mingshi could indicate that he did as the account stated that he proclaimed imperial instructions to the kings of these countries. Although, this may as well not be the case, because the fleet only made short stops at Calicut (4 days outward and 9 days homeward) <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> provided enough time to travel overland to Ganbali, unless the location did not refer to Coimatore but elsewhere in southern India. The overland journey may have been undertaken by someone else than Zheng He himself. The Mingshi account about Lasa states that ambassadors from Lasa, Aden, and Brava traveled with Zheng He to China. This meant that the ships carrying them had possibly reassembled with the main fleet in Calicut according to Dreyer (2007), depending on whether Zheng He visited these countries in person or remained with the main portion of the fleet. Dreyer (2007) thinks that the detached squadrons had probably already assembled at Calicut for its homeward journey, because the main fleet didn't stay there for long.|$|E

500|$|The premiership {{competition}} of 1902 was {{decided in the}} match between University and Western Suburbs on 27 August 1902. After the match, Verge and other players from both teams departed for Brisbane with the NSW team, where neither he, nor several others of his teammates, had ever played. Western beat University and one commentator thought that Western's fullback, Richard Simpson, had outplayed Verge. The first match against Queensland on 30 August was won by the home side, 16–11. Verge's performance was less well received {{than in the previous}} inter-state match, with comments that his tackling was unreliable, although he kicked well. The following week, on 6 September, NSW played Queensland again and won a hard-fought victory 8–13, although a man short for the final 20 minutes.

He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, {{a strong sense of}} personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found [...] "a world of motifs <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been more Japanese".
