5|$|This Week is {{a current}} affairs {{television}} series {{which began in}} 1956. In 1978, it was renamed TV Eye and took on a slightly lighter format; the title <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the ITV regions and became a mainstay of ITV's current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including Margaret Thatcher (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.|$|E
25|$|During last week's game at Baltimore, the Colts' {{defense was}} {{the talk of}} the week, not their offense. <b>This</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> similar as the Colts {{surrendered}} only 3 points to the Jaguars. This game between AFC South division rivals was dominated by the running game for both teams, and the defensive lines. Colts QB Peyton Manning was 13 of 28 for 122 yards passing, with no touchdowns and an interception while Jacksonville QB Byron Leftwich finished the game 16 of 29 for 198 yards passing. Edgerrin James finished his day off with 27 carries for 128 yards rushing, and Jacksonville RB Fred Taylor finished with 16 carries for 81 yards. Jacksonville had seven fumbles in this game, but recovered every one of them. This game was scoreless until there was less than seven minutes to go in the third quarter.|$|E
25|$|Tibor, Jason and Gabrielle battled {{it out for}} an Aussie Christmas episode {{which set}} a new {{standard}} {{so far in the}} show. Gold Coast chef/teacher Jason struggled with his signature dish round with his Cafe Del Mare (seafood platter For 2) which he served cold after cooking it too early. Gabs impressed the two male judges with an old favourite, aussie burgers minus the beetroot, and Tibor went over the top with a Jurassic feast of ostrich, barbecued pears with spiced honey, walnuts and blue cheese. The secret ingredient <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> turkey, and while Jason professed his loathe for the bird, he was the only contestant able to cook it properly. Mark, Julia and Ben refused to eat Tibor's and Gabrielle's turkey (as it was medium rare) and declared Jason the winner, although Mark thought he was not the best on the day, preferring Gabrielle as a choice. Clearly Jason's food was presented well and his technique was polished thus the judges wanted to see more and gave him the chance to do so as he was put through to the semi finals.|$|E

500|$|... : Bea and Marcus {{received}} the most nominations, however Big Brother declared the result void due to Marcus attempting to influence his fellow housemates on several occasions and Siavash refusing to nominate. As punishment, all housemates faced the public vote. Unlike previous weeks, <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> a vote to save.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} {{received a}} mixed response from reviewers. Votta said that [...] "the songs were mostly forgettable and generally useless to advancing the plot", and Canning maintained that [...] "the music <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> just okay". Although VanDerWerff called the musical numbers [...] "mostly superfluous", he described {{many of them}} as [...] "pretty fun", while Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle said he [...] "wasn’t incredibly moved by this week’s Spanish-flavored selections".|$|E

500|$|While Halo 2s release had set {{industry}} records, {{the mainstream}} press was not fully involved in covering the game; part of Microsoft's strategy was to fully involve casual readers and the press in the story. The saturation of advertising and promotions led Wired to state: [...] "The release of Halo 3 <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> an event that stretched far beyond our little gaming world. Everyone from The New York Times to Mother Jones wanted to cover it." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>This</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> {{homecoming}} for the Sooners, {{and there}} were some special celebrations planned. [...] All season, Oklahoma had been remembering and recognizing the career of the late Prentice Gautt, the first African-American football player at the university. Gautt's jersey number (38) was not issued this season to any players and for the game against Colorado the 38yard-line on both halves of the field was highlighted with crimson. This year also marked the 50th anniversary of the 1956 National Championship won by the Sooners. At least 34 members of that team were expected to attend the game, including former All-Americans Bill Krisher, Tommy McDonald, and Clendon Thomas.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "came close to {{fulfilling}} [...] potential, {{but was unable to}} keep the rapid-fire comedic pace going for the entire episode." [...] He added that {{the second half of the}} show was not [...] "a complete loss, but, man, that first act just steamrolled viewers with hilarious bit after hilarious bit." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide thought that the [...] "unexpected treat <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> guest star James Carville, who's presence as confidant to Jack not only made sense, but Carville also had a lot of fun lampooning himself 'Cajun style' and all. And look at how well his advice for Frank and Twofer worked!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{staff of}} Open Salon.com enjoyed the episode, writing [...] "While I enjoyed {{the last eight}} weeks of {{alternate}} universe hijinks, this week's episode reminded me of what I had been missing from the earlier seasons... It's nice to know we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E
500|$|Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{said the}} series worked because it played [...] "with the absurdities of the {{television}} business lightly". Stanley felt that 30 Rock was at its best when it revolved around the characters, and not the show itself. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that although Tracy and Jenna [...] "had their moments in two rather weak storylines", the [...] "unfunny and distracting 'Where's Waldo?' casting [...] " [...] disrupted {{the flow of the}} episode. He enjoyed the improvement of the show, and said that [...] "though not every story <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> stellar, you didn't go long without a decent laugh." [...] Canning gave [...] "Jack Meets Dennis" [...] a 7.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich said the episode was [...] "one of the stronger episodes thus far", citing that [...] "veryone got funny stuff to do, the Jack-Liz scenes were crackling and teaming with Liz-induced self-humiliation, and we even got a Rachel Dratch cameo (as that angry, angry Liz Taylor)." [...] Mitovich who had not been a fan of the Jenna character, said that he enjoyed her in this episode. Alan Pergament for The Buffalo News wrote, [...] "The extent that stars go to literally and figuratively maintain their images probably sounded funny on paper , but most of it falls flat and illustrates why 30 Rock has been sinking like a rock". Pergament gave this episode two out of four stars. Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on 30 Rock, noting that he did a [...] "hilarious turn" [...] as Dennis. Matt Roush for TV Guide reported that Alec Baldwin [...] "stole the show" [...] in this episode.|$|E

Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History announced {{the second week of}} February to be [...] "Negro History Week." [...] <b>This</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> chosen because it coincided with the birthday of Abraham Lincoln on February 12 and of Frederick Douglass on February 14, both of which dates Black communities had celebrated together since the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Political satirist and {{commentator}} Rick Mercer wrote, [...] "The {{drama that}} played out <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>was</b> many things: unimaginable, embarrassing and, yes, it made our parliamentary system {{look like a}} laughingstock. However, this situation was not, as Mr. Harper insisted, undemocratic, illegal or un-Canadian." [...] The editorial board of The Globe and Mail echoed Mercer's sentiment, pointing out that Harper's statements on {{the legality of the}} coalition were [...] "knowingly erroneous" [...] and, in June 2012, Peter H. Russell said the Conservative's attacks on the legitimacy of the coalition proposal were [...] "deliberately misleading" [...] and that the notion that [...] "a multiparty government must be approved by voters beforehand is 'absolutely B.S.'" ...|$|E
