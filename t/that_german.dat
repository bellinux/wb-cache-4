5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a long war with Britain and many commentators suggest <b>that</b> <b>German</b> invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E
5|$|German {{fighter pilot}} Siegfried Bethke said <b>that</b> <b>German</b> {{aircraft}} that {{crashed into the}} Channel were not counted in the official figures and that one aircraft in his unit that was damaged by 88 hits was broken up and taken back to Germany and not added to the loss record.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{operator}} James Fort {{attempted to}} contact headquarters on the SCR-284 radio {{mounted on a}} jeep by the command post and found <b>that</b> <b>German</b> martial music jammed the channel. He then used a side-channel and Morse code, hoping the Germans weren't listening, to send a status report to regimental headquarters.|$|E

50|$|For example, it {{is known}} <b>that</b> many <b>Germans</b> enjoyed American jazz music, it is also known <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> sang songs in Nazi {{sponsored}} events; {{but it would be}} difficult to determine the relative popularity of this music in the current context of shame concerning the war.|$|R
5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were so successful <b>that</b> <b>German</b> estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only}} a vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E
5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had already been a target for the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating <b>that</b> <b>German</b> commanders were concerned by the possibility of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.|$|E
5|$|By noon of 7 August, {{the early}} morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied {{aircraft}} appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe <b>that</b> <b>German</b> forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft {{from the moment they}} took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield. In the open ground east of Mortain, the German Panzers became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF.|$|E
5000|$|Ivanov wrote <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> {{exploited}} the Soviet [...] "carelessness, complacency and hope <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> {{will do nothing}} serious, confining themselves to provocations". He notes that [...] "despite the obvious signs of a large concentration of German troops, {{the commander of the}} Kiev Military District forbade the deployment of covering forces, as well as bringing troops into combat readiness, especially strengthening them even after the shelling of the state border and air raids" [...] began.|$|R

5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated <b>that</b> <b>German</b> people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was <b>that</b> <b>German</b> guards kicked over buckets of water {{that had been left}} at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared their concerns that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of their freedom to roam and engage the enemy on their own terms. They also pointed to the fact <b>that</b> <b>German</b> bombers flew at medium altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having {{to carry out a}} task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E
50|$|By {{tradition}} of pilots, a note {{had been thrown}} down from a German airplane and it is reported <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> buried {{the crew of the}} airplane with military honours.|$|R

5000|$|Sergi {{claimed the}} Nordics {{had made no}} {{substantial}} contribution to pre-modern civilization, noting that [...] "in the epoch of Tacitus the Germans ... remained barbarians as in prehistoric times". He claimed that the Romans were unable to Romanize the Germans because the Germans were averse to the Romans' civilizing influence. He rejected Germanic scholars' claims <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> were the saviors of a decadent post-Roman Italy. Instead Sergi claimed <b>that</b> the <b>Germans</b> were responsible for bringing forward the Dark Ages in the Medieval period and <b>that</b> the <b>Germans</b> of the Medieval period were known for [...] "delinquency, vagabondage, and ferocity".|$|R
5|$|In 1941 the British Admiralty started {{receiving}} reports <b>that</b> <b>German</b> submarines {{were using}} the rivers in Vichy French parts of Africa {{as a base for}} refuelling. The unit selected to investigate the reports was the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF) also known as No. 62 Commando. The SSRF was formed in 1941, and consisted {{of a small group of}} 55 commando-trained personnel working with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). While being under operational control of Combined Operations Headquarters, No. 62 Commando itself was under the command Major Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps, usually called Gus March-Phillipps.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear <b>that</b> <b>German</b> flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a {{scriptwriter}} for Terra Filmkunst, {{mentioned his}} idea to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom he}} was working on the script for Central Rio. Ebbecke shot down the idea, raising a number of objections including the fact that Mendes had already done a film on the same topic in England and the concern <b>that</b> <b>German</b> audiences might confuse the proposed film with Feuchtwanger's novel which was not antisemitic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sufferings of}} Germans were {{presented}} in isolation, with little reference to the sufferings of Jews, Poles, Russians, Czechs, etc. The impression given is <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> were the primary victims of the war.|$|R
50|$|The Versailles treaty had stipulated <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> in {{the part}} of German Reich {{territory}} to be ceded to Poland, the Polish Corridor, had until 1922 to make the choice for Polish or German citizenship.|$|R
50|$|A further, if minor, {{element in}} his polemic {{consisted}} {{in an argument}} <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> were a distinct people within Christianity, descended from the Canaanites, whom 'the Jews' were intent on destroying in accordance with Deuteronomy 7:16.|$|R
5|$|In mid-May, aerial {{reconnaissance}} near Mont Sorrel indicated <b>that</b> <b>German</b> forces were preparing an attack. Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, well behind the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. The Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the more dangerous German positions, when the Germans executed an assault of their own.|$|E
5|$|New Zealands first wartime {{action was}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, {{as part of}} the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty's ships were {{originally}} intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant <b>that</b> <b>German</b> capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} Jade estuary.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>German</b> fans had until July 28 to choose their top 30 songs from an extensive pool of 121 tracks; The German version was released on August 22. The German pool list contained almost every song Jackson released in his solo career. Notably expansions on the pool choice included: A larger option of tracks from Thriller 25 and the inclusion of 12 tracks from The Ultimate Collection. There were also 8 tracks included from the singers time in The Jackson 5/Jacksons; slightly {{more than the other}} versions. The German edition was also released in Switzerland on the same day.|$|E
5000|$|The feeling <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> {{were the}} Aryan Herrenvolk (Aryan master race) was widely spread among the German public through Nazi {{propaganda}} and among Nazi officials throughout the ranks, in particular when Reichskommissariat Ukraine Erich Koch said: ...|$|R
5000|$|The claim <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> {{used the}} fat from human corpses to make products, {{including}} soap, was made during World War I. This {{appears to have}} originated as rumor among British soldiers and Belgians. The first recorded reference is in 1915 when Cynthia Asquith noted in her diary (16 June 1915): [...] "We discussed the rumour <b>that</b> the <b>Germans</b> utilise even their corpses by converting them into glycerine with the by-product of soap." [...] It became a major international story when The Times of London reported in April 1917 <b>that</b> the <b>Germans</b> had admitted rendering the bodies of their dead soldiers for fat to make soap and other products.|$|R
5000|$|... {{shake and}} humiliate the Germans and prove to them beyond any {{possible}} challenge <b>that</b> these <b>German</b> {{crimes against humanity}} were committed and <b>that</b> the <b>German</b> people - {{and not just the}} Nazis and SS - bore responsibility.|$|R
5|$|Operation Heiderose was a {{significant}} success for the division, inflicting serious losses on the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and {{a large amount of}} equipment was captured: one anti-tank gun, two mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses, with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead, wounded and missing. However, Partisan reports estimate <b>that</b> <b>German</b> losses were significantly larger than their own. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division's formation.|$|E
5|$|Otranto {{accompanied}} Cradock {{and three}} cruisers {{to patrol the}} Strait of Magellan and the Chilean coast for German ships in mid-September. They failed to locate any of the German ships, but Otranto intercepted messages that indicated <b>that</b> <b>German</b> warships were operating in the area. Cradock concentrated his ships on the southwestern coast of South America in mid-October to prevent the East Asia Squadron under Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee from breaking through into the South Atlantic. In mid-October Otranto struck a rock while departing Port Legunas, Chile, but a diver from Monmouth reported that it had done very little damage.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{intelligence}} reports issued from 8 to 9 July reported that defensive works were being constructed by German infantry on the flanks of the 4th Panzer Army, and <b>that</b> <b>German</b> armoured formations were {{not present in}} these locations, {{despite the fact that}} Soviet armoured formations were situated opposite these flanks. Voronezh Front headquarters supposed the Germans must be reaching their limit, and on 10 July decided to set its counterattack to coincide with the planned Soviet counteroffensive on the northern side of the Kursk salient, Operation Kutuzov, which was set for 12 July.|$|E
5000|$|Höcke gave {{a speech}} in Dresden in January 2017, in which, {{referring}} to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin, he stated <b>that</b> [...] "we <b>Germans</b> are {{the only people in}} the world who have planted a memorial of shame in the heart of their capital" [...] and suggested <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> [...] "need to make a 180 degree change in their politics of commemoration." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Stürmer played a {{prominent}} role in the Historikerstreit. Left-wing historians criticized him for an essay he wrote entitled [...] "Land Without History" [...] published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on April 25, 1986, in which Stürmer claimed <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> lacked a history to be proud of, and called for a positive evaluation of German history as a way of building national pride. Stürmer argued <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> were suffering from a [...] "loss of orientation" [...] caused by the lack of a positive view of their history In Stürmer's view, the fall of the Weimar Republic was caused by [...] "loss of orientation" [...] caused by the secularization of a previously religious country.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequent}} claims <b>that</b> <b>Germans</b> would constantly eat {{hard and}} tasteless Graubrot and Schwarzbrot are likely urban legends, or prejudice, possibly originating from soldier tales during World War II. Especially since {{those kinds of}} bread are usually the strongest in sourdough flavour.|$|R
