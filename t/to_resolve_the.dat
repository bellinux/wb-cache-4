5|$|The European Ombudsman {{is elected}} by the Parliament, who deals with public {{complaints}} against all institutions. Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> citizens dispute.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal dispute}} then arose between RRP {{claiming}} £529,000 in fees, and the National Assembly claiming £6.85M in damages. On 10 December 2001 RRP requested an appointment of an adjudicator from the Construction Industry Council <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> issue. The adjudication {{took place in}} February 2002, and ruled that RRP was entitled to £448,000 of its claim, while the National Assembly was not entitled {{to any of the}} damages they had claimed.|$|E

5|$|After Parker {{was hired}} to direct the film, Gerolmo had {{completed}} two drafts. Parker met with Gerolmo at Orion's offices in Century City, Los Angeles, where they began work on a third draft script. Both the writer and director however had repeated disagreements over {{the focus of the}} story. <b>To</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> issue, Orion executives in New York gave Parker one month to make uncredited rewrites before green-lighting the project.|$|E
5|$|After the Department of the Interior {{was stopped}} from issuing a {{construction}} permit, the unincorporated TAPS consortium was reorganized {{into the new}} incorporated Alyeska Pipeline Service Company.

5|$|Anjouan {{promised to}} hold new {{elections}} in May 2008, which South African President Thabo Mbeki supported {{as a way}} <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> crisis.

5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> issue of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E
5|$|Attempts <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> {{electrical}} {{units in}} terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell's son and {{approximately}} 50 other children boycotted the school, {{because of its}} decision to not let the children wear the SNCC freedom pins.

She helped open freedom schools in Issaquena County, <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> issue.

5|$|Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon was {{loyal to}} the Union during the Civil War. He {{represented}} his county and his state {{in a number of}} failed conventions that sought <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> upcoming conflict before it began. In 1864, he joined Kentucky governor Thomas E. Bramlette in an audience with President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of former slaves as Union soldiers in Kentucky. Dixon died on April 23, 1876.|$|E
5|$|During the {{previous}} administration of President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State Seward attempted <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> Alabama Claims with the Johnson-Clarendon convention and treaty.

5|$|From its inception, the {{position}} of Minister of Defence in the government in exile was heavily contested. The appointment of Henri Rolin, an academic, to {{the position}} was particularly resented. In October 1942, Pierlot dismissed Rolin who he accused of involving himself in factional internal politics of the army, parts of which had begun to behave mutinously about their perceived inaction. <b>To</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> deadlock, Pierlot decided {{to take on the}} position personally. He began a major restructuring of the command structure of the infantry in an ultimately successful attempt <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> situation. A minor mutiny among soldiers from an artillery battery was quickly suppressed in November 1942, but Pierlot was widely criticised by the British press during the soldiers' court martial in January 1943.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke {{had been}} {{negotiating}} with France <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> long-standing disagreements over {{the administration of}} Gascony, {{and as part of}} this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>the</b> problems in the south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in Notre Dame, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant. Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.|$|E
