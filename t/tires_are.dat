25|$|Its combat <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} {{enduring}} anti-personnel mine explosions and small arms fire. If {{the vehicle is}} damaged while afloat, a drainage system is capable of removing incoming water. The BTR-90 also features an automatic fire fighting system, and a system for remote laying of smoke screens. The smoke discharge system includes six smoke grenade launchers, three {{on each side of}} the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|When the {{surfaces}} are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes {{a very poor}} approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even {{when there is no}} normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.|$|E

Large pieces of concrete somehow find their way into the creek at various locations and sit amongst the rocks almost blending in if it weren't for the exposed aggregate. Clothing is also common, particularly synthetic items such as gloves, shoes and bags, while clothing such as shirts made from organic materials break down into the environment.|$|E

25|$|The Prius is a {{power-split}} or series-parallel (full) hybrid, {{sometimes referred}} to as a combined hybrid, a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline or electric power or both. Wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25 (0.29 for 2000 model) with a Kammback design to reduce air resistance. Lower rolling-resistance <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> used to reduce road friction. An electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts. In the US and Canada, a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time. The Prius engine makes use of the Atkinson cycle.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|E
25|$|Damage modeling, {{although}} {{limited in}} vehicles, is most noticeable {{in the ability}} to burst tires, although wheeled vehicles can still move even if all the <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> gone, slowly rolling along on the rims. Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs can lose their tracks as a result of damage, but may continue moving even though there is no way for the drive sprockets to propel the vehicle. Exposed gas cans on Humvees can be shot in order to detonate their contents, which usually results in the explosion of the vehicle. While burning, destroyed vehicles will cause proximity heat damage to objects and characters. Unavailable vehicles shown in-game include jet aircraft, excavator, forklift and for reasons of scale, destroyers. None of the alien machines can be commandeered by players. Interestingly, the wheeled carts which would presumably be used to move aircraft or heavy vehicles, can also be moved by the player, but movement is very slow and useful for little more than entertainment/novelty.|$|E
50|$|The lateral slip of a <b>tire</b> <b>is</b> the {{sideways}} {{motion of}} a tire which {{occurs when the}} sideway forces of a <b>tire</b> <b>are</b> greater than its friction resistance. This can occur, for instance, in cornering.|$|R
5000|$|NASCAR's [...] "tire war" [...] was notable {{during the}} 1994 season. Both Goodyear and Hoosier <b>tires</b> <b>were</b> used by entrants. Many of the front-runners {{utilized}} Goodyear. Among the top teams using Hoosier <b>tires</b> <b>was</b> Geoff Bodine.|$|R

500|$|Lastly, {{the concern}} of {{adjacent}} coastal areas is that the <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> not remaining {{within the boundaries of}} Osborne Reef. [...] In 1995, Hurricane Opal managed to spread over 1,000 tires onto the Florida Panhandle, west of Pensacola; and in 1998, Hurricane Bonnie deposited thousands of the tires onto North Carolina beaches.|$|E
500|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through frame, which weigh about [...] each. Their one-piece {{aluminum frame}} and handlebars conceal cables and fasteners {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism and bad weather; the handlebars are located above the seat, allowing riders to sit upright and thereby maintain balance. They are equipped with a Shimano Nexus three-speed, twist-shifter-operated internal geared hub, full mudguards/fenders and chainguard. The heavy-duty <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> puncture-resistant and filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. The <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> also wider, leading to increased stability. Twin LED rear lights of a pre-2015 design are integrated into the frame, whose bright-blue color increases the bikes' visibility. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec, region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan. Citi Bikes are slower than most utility bicycles, averaging only [...] as opposed to regular bicycles' average speed of , which increases safety due to a lowered risk of a high-speed collision. The bikes are assembled in Detroit.|$|E

If the combined bike and rider center of mass is at a height of 26inches, then a 25° lean must be increased by 7.28°: a nearly 30% increase. If the <b>tires</b> <b>are</b> only 6inches wide, then the lean angle increase is only 3.16°, just under half.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{solid rubber}} tires before the {{pneumatic}} <b>tire</b> <b>was</b> invented, solid <b>tires,</b> made of polyurethane or microcellular foam are also offered for 100% flat prevention.

40|$|Abstract. Aircraft <b>tire</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} subassembly of aircraft, which {{is related to}} its safety tightly, especially for civil aircraft. Moreover, hydroplaning of aircraft <b>tires</b> <b>is</b> often a contributing factor in take-off and landing overrun and veeroff accidents. Therefore the study on them is imperative. For studying the hydroplaning of aircraft tire, a 2 D finite element model of aircraft <b>tire</b> <b>is</b> developed by using TYABAS software, and then a 3 D patterned <b>tire</b> model <b>is</b> presented. The hydroplaning of aircraft <b>tire</b> <b>is</b> analyzed by generally coupling an Eulerian finite volume method and an explicit Lagrangian finite element method. The hydroplaning speeds are investigated, which is a key factor of hydroplaning. Results indicated that the hydroplaning speed increases with the increment of inflation pressure; the hydroplaning speed decreases with the increment of the footprint aspect ratio...|$|R
