5|$|Monpas, {{who belong}} to the Gelug sect, are the {{dominant}} sect of the Kameng region. Many Monpa boys join <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> and become Lamas. When young boys join <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> to train, {{it is on the}} condition that it is a lifetime commitment. If a monk wishes to leave <b>the</b> <b>monastery,</b> a heavy penalty is levied. According to a past custom, in a family of three sons, the middle son was conscripted to <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> and in a family of two sons the youngest son was inducted into <b>the</b> <b>monastery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> is where ritual dances are performed. The walls of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> also have a profusion of thangkas of Buddhist deities and saints. Curtains are {{suspended}} over the balcony and these are painted with Buddhist symbols. Within the precincts of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> there are residential buildings to accommodate about 700 monks, which now houses 450 monks. The abbot of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> resides in a house located near the gate at the southeastern corner of <b>the</b> <b>monastery.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> {{currently}} has control over 17 gompas in West Kameng district. <b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> has administrative control over two dzongs, each {{headed by a}} monk; the Darana Dzong built in 1831 and the Sanglem Dzong, also known as Talung Gompa, in the south west part of Kameng district. These dzongs not only collect taxes but also preach Buddhism to the Monpas and Sherdukpens of Kameng. <b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> owns cultivable lands in the villages of Soma and Nerguit and a few patches in some other villages which are tilled and cultivated by farmers, who share the produce with <b>the</b> <b>monastery.</b> The present resident head of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> is the incarnate Gyalsy Rinpochey.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>monasteries,</b> which {{sometimes}} also functioned as cathedrals, and the cathedrals that had bodies of secular clergy often living in community, were {{a major source}} of power in Europe. Bishops and the abbots of important monasteries lived and functioned like princes. <b>The</b> <b>monasteries</b> were <b>the</b> major seats of learning of all sorts. Benedict had ordered that all the arts were to be taught and practiced in <b>the</b> <b>monasteries.</b> Within <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> books were transcribed by hand, and few people outside <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> could read or write.|$|R

50|$|The {{relative}} desolation of Vologda lands attracted monks {{looking for}} solitude. This {{resulted in a}} large number of <b>monasteries.</b> <b>The</b> Kirillo-Belozersky <b>Monastery,</b> <b>the</b> Spaso-Prilutsky <b>Monastery,</b> <b>the</b> Goritsky <b>Monastery,</b> and <b>the</b> Troitse-Gledensky <b>Monastery</b> represent examples of Russian medieval fortification architecture and also contain buildings rated among the best preserved cultural heritage. <b>The</b> Ferapontov <b>Monastery,</b> included into <b>the</b> World Heritage list, contains the only survived fully painted church in Russia with the frescoes of Dionisius. As of 2010, four of <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> in Vologda Oblast were acting: the Kirillo-Belozersky, the Spaso-Prilutsky, the Goritsky, and <b>the</b> Pavlo-Obnorsky <b>monasteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|With the Mongol {{invasion}} of Rus' by Batu Khan in 1237-40, <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> {{is supposed to}} have been completely destroyed. These legends were written down much later. <b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> is known to have existed in the 14th century, though. In 1482, it was attacked by the Crimean Tatars under Meñli I Giray. Reconstruction on <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> began only 40 years later. In 1523, <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> was transferred to the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> was given a full reign over its territory. In 1555, the complex consisted of four churches, including and one cave church.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{destroyed}} part of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> {{during the}} War of the Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, French troops looted {{the buildings and}} used them as barracks. The monks were forced to leave in 1820 because of confiscations by a new liberal government, but they returned in 1823 after King Ferdinand VII restored conservative institutions. However, the nearby villagers denied support to <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> despite its protection by the king. <b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> ceased to operate in 1835: the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> had only four monks and one lay brother, who were cast out.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of <b>the</b> <b>monastery,</b> who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of <b>the</b> <b>monastery.</b>|$|E

60|$|The answer is, that <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> {{were not}} {{altogether}} tenanted by incapables.

5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at <b>the</b> <b>monastery,</b> has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to <b>the</b> <b>monastery,</b> loses the message, but is recognised as the dog from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the Horn of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to the Horn of the Yak.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804–1885), at {{that time}} head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and {{subsequently}} Bishop of Chigirin, visited <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> and the codex was shown to him, together with leaves which Tischendorf had not seen. In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from <b>the</b> <b>monastery.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Spanish state sold <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> to Fernando Beloso for {{a little}} more than 3,100 pesetas, roughly $600 to $700 at the time.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Safavid dynasty in the 15th century, <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> were preserved. <b>The</b> <b>monasteries</b> were then deserted during the 16th and 17th centuries {{following}} a period of attacks by the Ottomans that prompted many Armenians to emigrate to central Iran. Once the Safavids reestablished themselves in <b>the</b> area, <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> were reoccupied and renovated. However, during the 18th century the area became a cauldron of conflicts for domination among the Russian, Ottoman, and Persian empires. When the Persians finally gained control, <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> were damaged. During the Qajar era, Armenians regained control over <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> and they were rebuilt. The existing St. Thaddeus Monastery was rebuilt in 1814 and refurbished in the 1970s.|$|R

5|$|The islet in {{the left}} foreground, today known as Riddarholmen ("Knights' Islet"), was during the medieval era known as Gråmunkeholmen ("Greyfriars Islet") after the Franciscan monastery located there and in the {{painting}} represented as a building with stepped gables and a tall turret {{at the far side}} of the islet. Together with other similar institutions, <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> was closed by the king following the Reformation although the building was used as a hospital until the mid 16th century. The turret of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> was replaced by the cast iron spire of Riddarholm Church in the 19th century, but the remains of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings.|$|E

25|$|Over <b>the</b> centuries, <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> {{acquired}} riches {{and secular}} dependents, gradually increasing their {{wealth and power}} as the wealth {{and power of the}} Mongol nobility declined. Some nobles donated a portion of their dependent families — people, rather than land, were the foundation of wealth and power in old Mongolia — to <b>the</b> <b>monasteries.</b> Some herders dedicated themselves and their families to serve <b>the</b> <b>monasteries,</b> either from piety or from the desire to escape the arbitrary exactions of the nobility. In some areas, <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> and their living buddhas (of whom there were a total of 140 in 1924) were also the secular authorities. In the 1920s, there were about 110,000 monks, including children, who made up about one-third of the male population, although many of these lived outside <b>the</b> <b>monasteries</b> and did not observe their vows. About 250,000 people, {{more than a third of}} the total population, either lived in territories administered by monasteries and living Buddhas or were hereditary dependents of <b>the</b> <b>monasteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an {{excellent}} library.

The {{dilapidated}} monastery was returned to the Church in the 1990s. The restoration of its church and other buildings was completed in 2005. Since around 1995 the relics have been kept in the Orthodox cathedral of Tirana, the capital of Albania, and are brought back to <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> only for the saint's feast day.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of Saint Barbara, {{alleged to have}} been brought to Kiev from Constantinople in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife and kept in a silver reliquary donated by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Although most of <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> grounds were secularized in the late eighteenth century, as many as 240 monks resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. <b>The</b> <b>monastery</b> served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800.
