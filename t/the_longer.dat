5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E

5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E

The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family.

5|$|Although the Panzer IV was {{deployed}} to north Africa with the German Afrika Korps, until <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> gun variant began production, the tank was outperformed by the Panzer III {{with respect to}} armor penetration. Both the Panzer III and IV had difficulty in penetrating the British Matilda II's thick armor, while the Matilda's 40-mm QF 2 pounder gun could knock out either German tank; its major disadvantage was its low speed. By August 1942, Rommel had only received 27 Panzer IV Ausf. F2s, armed with the L/43 gun, which he {{deployed to}} spearhead his armored offensives. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> gun could penetrate all American and British tanks in theater at ranges of up to , {{by that time the}} most heavily armored of which was the M3 Grant. Although more of these tanks arrived in North Africa between August and October 1942, their numbers were insignificant compared to the amount of matériel shipped to British forces.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians argue that the dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E

Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E

5|$|Eventually {{a liberal}} agitation, pro-Greek and {{inspired}} {{by what was}} then happening in that country, began to develop in France. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> France waited, the more delicate her position vis-à-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which {{did not wish to}} see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
