25|$|The {{receptor}} on the vertebrate {{host cell}} is sialic acid, which is {{bound by the}} viral glycoprotein. Entry is by endocytosis, with fusion of the viral and cell membranes occurring once the vesicle is acidified. In common with other orthomyxoviruses, viral transcription and replication both occur in the cell nucleus. In {{some members of the}} genus, replication has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mx1/MxA protein, which is induced in mice and humans in response to interferon. In one study, this inhibitory effect was shown to be caused by MxA preventing the transport of the THOV genome into the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with spin which refers to the magnetic dipole moments of particles, much experimental work is continuing on measuring the electric dipole moments (EDM) of fundamental and composite particles, namely those of the electron and neutron, respectively. As EDMs violate both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries, their values yield a mostly model-independent measure of CP-violation in nature (assuming CPT symmetry is valid). Therefore, values for these EDMs place strong constraints upon the scale of CP-violation that extensions to the standard model of particle physics may allow. Current generations of experiments are designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> supersymmetry range of EDMs, providing complementary experiments to those done at the LHC.|$|E

25|$|Leaders of both fraternities {{made great}} {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pain {{of change and}} emotions of loss that any such merger would naturally entail. There were pockets of dissent, and not all chapters nor all alumni of Phi Sigma Epsilon participated. Soon after the merger, {{unable or unwilling to}} commit to another national, the former PSE chapter at Cornell was released, and its building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other PSE chapters were found to be non-viable or had simply vanished in the time since a PSE officer had last visited or corresponded, and these were formally closed. Eventually, following several disaffected alumni leaders of Phi Sigma Epsilon, seven PSE groups would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{has been}} shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{dynamics}} of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. She has once sensed a diseased and dying tree on the X-Mansion grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun {{as well as the}} distortion of a planet's magnetosphere. Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns. Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body. Sentinels have considered Storm an Omega-level mutant on one occasion.|$|E

According to Kurien, use of modern and most sophisticated technology is characteristic of BAPS. In Modern Transmission of Hindu Traditions in India and Abroad, a former Leicester professor in the Religion Department, Douglas Brear, points out BAPS' concern to transmit comprehensive Hindu tradition in the twentieth-century. He observes that the teachings are indeed transmitted, but the transmission mode [...] "has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of the times".|$|E
