40|$|We {{present a}} model that shows how {{interactions}} between creditor groups in bankruptcy can affect the debt issuance decisions of firms. In particular, we show <b>that</b> firms <b>that</b> <b>issue</b> debt with a specific seniority level may tend to keep issuing debt {{at the same level}} to avoid the costs of conflicts in bankruptcy. Our model also has predictions as to what types of firms may change seniority level in sequential issues. We also find that as bankruptcy costs increase, firms will tend to issue more junior debt. The empirical implications of our model are consistent with the somewhat surprising fact <b>that</b> most firms <b>issue</b> debt at one seniority level only, and quite a few of them cluster at the senior subordinated level. We also find <b>that</b> companies <b>that</b> <b>issue</b> subordinated debt are much smaller than those which issue senior debt, while those <b>that</b> <b>issue</b> at both levels are intermediate on most financial measures. These empirical regularities are broadly consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our model is also supported by the fact <b>that</b> companies <b>that</b> <b>issue</b> only senior debt pay lower spreads than companies <b>that</b> <b>issue</b> at both levels.

5|$|The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), {{which is}} a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force <b>that</b> <b>issues</b> {{tropical}} cyclone warnings for the region, also issued advisories for storms in the year. The agency tracked a tropical depression in July 1982. The system formed on July4 southeast of Seychelles, and initially curved to the southwest. It failed to intensify beyond winds of 55km/h (35mph), and dissipated on July4 after turning to the northwest. At the time, the annual tropical cyclone year was from August1 to July31 of the subsequent year.|$|E

Banda believed <b>that</b> <b>issues</b> relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for Malawian citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} <b>that</b> <b>issues</b> relating to {{time would be}} {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E

5|$|Local Czech militants forced about 5,000 local Poles, {{mostly from}} the {{northern}} part of the region, to flee to Poland already before July 1920. 4,000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim. About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities, but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different. The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. This and other factors contributed to the assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with the Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not abide by certain laws related to language, legislative, and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put <b>that</b> <b>issues</b> on agenda. One way or the other, increasingly local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E
