An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>injury,</b> she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the only}} other bridge across the Delaware River easily {{accessible}} for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens kept two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They kept the place clear from thieves and <b>to</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>injury,</b> kept people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often kept people from getting money they may have dropped on the ground for people exiting their cars.|$|E

Kaplan suggested that they instead go to the tracks on the subsequent Mondays and run a developmental program using Sunday’s winning times as the benchmark. AMC didn’t agree, and Kaplan ran the year with the engines on hand.

25|$|Likewise, the English had {{dominated}} {{the trade in}} spices and textiles with Italy and Turkey. England consumed most of the olive oil and currants exported from those lands. However, after 1648 here too occurred a complete reversal {{in favor of the}} Dutch. The Genoese shifted their purchases to the Dutch entrepot and started to use Dutch shipping for their carrying trade predominantly. This was mostly due to the far-lower shipping rates the Dutch charged. But other factors in the sudden rise of the share the Dutch obtained in the intra-Mediterranean trade were the grip they obtained on the trade in Spanish bullion (often reminted as Dutch trade coins of high quality) to the Levant, and the progress the Dutch fine-cloth industry made with their products that were of a higher quality than the English. As a result, the English were thrown on the defensive in this area, too. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>injury</b> more and more imports that had reached England directly before, were from now on re-exported from the Amsterdam entrepot in Dutch ships.|$|E

It had refused to rely on her statement. The Supreme Court observed that the appreciation of evidence by the trial court was “not only unreasonable but perverse”. It held that: “The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable.

25|$|Managua's {{progress}} came to {{a sudden}} halt after it suffered a second major earthquake on December 23, 1972, which destroyed 90% of the city's downtown and killed more than 19,120 people. Infrastructure was severely damaged and rehabilitation or restoration of buildings was nearly impossible. At the time, Managua's limited resources had to be directed to other disaster relief purposes. Managua's {{ability to cope with}} the disaster was also limited. Surviving fire squadrons and ambulance companies were not able to handle the skyrocketing demand for their services. Some buildings burned to the ground, while the foundations of others simply gave way. Not able to rebuild quickly, the city directed emergency workers to clear away much of the city's ruins quickly while burying the deceased in mass graves. Residences, government buildings and entire avenues were demolished. Escaping the city center, earthquake victims found refuge in the outskirts of the city. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>injury,</b> corruption within the Somoza regime which allocated part of the relief funds hindered the reconstruction of the city's center which remains somewhat isolated {{from the rest of the}} capital.|$|E
25|$|The Legislature dutifully {{complied}} with the court's recommendation and carved Presidio County into several new ones including Jeff Davis in 1887. The newly created counties, however, were immediately saddled with their pro rata share of their parent county's debt. Furthermore, Presidio County insisted that the new counties were responsible for paying for {{their share of the}} debt on its new Presidio County Courthouse. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>injury,</b> the new Jeff Davis County found the Fort Davis courthouse, which had sat dormant for two years since the removal of the previous county seat to Marfa, to be a shell of its former self with the building's fixtures and furniture also carried off along with its former official records. The courthouse retained its iron jail cells, but remained as inadequately small and in need of reparation as it had before. By 1910, the need for a new courthouse had become eminent. Numerous repairs, including repeated patching of the roof, had been regularly necessary. Two windows, heavily barred, had been added to the west wall of the upper cell housing women and less threatening prisoners for light and ventilation. Eventually jail facilities became so intolerable that all prisoners required transport to the Presidio County jail for detention, and the building as a whole was seen as being beyond further repair. After completion of construction on the replacement courthouse and the new separate jail building in 1911, the steel cell from the original courthouse was salvaged for use in the new jail, while dirt from the demolition of the old adobe courthouse was used for leveling the grounds of the new courthouse and jail yard.|$|E
25|$|The Barrie Colts {{would begin}} the season without the {{previous}} season's top scorers Tanner Pearson and Ivan Telegin who would play {{the season in}} the AHL. Overage defenceman Ryan O'Connor was named team captain. With the likes of Mark Scheifele, Anthony Camara, Steven Beyers, Zach Hall, and former London Knight Andreas Athanasiou, the Colts would continue to pack an offensive punch. Leading the way on defence were returnees Alex Yuill, Johnathan Laser, Aaron Ekblad, and Alex Lepkowski. Overager Mathias Neiderberger was stellar all year in goal. With this crop of experienced players, {{as well as a}} handful of rookies to fill in the gaps, the Colts would quickly take the top spot in the Eastern Conference; a position they would hold {{for the majority of the}} season. The Colts would also be ranked amongst the CHL Top Ten teams for most of the year as well. Throughout the season, many Colts would say goodbye through trades. Included in this group were Brendan Bell, Sammu Markula, Dylan Smoskowitz, and the Colts 2012 first round draft pick Brendan Perlini. In exchange they would receive many draft picks as well as defencman Jake Dotchin, and forwards Devon Rymarchuk, and Mitchell Theoret in the hopes that the Colts could make a run deep into the playoffs. Over the Christmas Break, sophomore defenceman Aaron Ekblad would captain Team Ontario's Under 17 squad, and both Anthony Camara, and Mark Scheifele would make Team Canada's Under 20 team. Scheifele would soon after be recalled to the NHL after the lockout was settled. He would remain with the Winnipeg Jets until early February when he was returned to the OHL. The Colts would lock down the 2nd place seed in the Eastern Conference heading into the playoffs. After quickly beating the 7th seed Kingston Frontenacs and 3rd seed Oshawa Generals 4 games to 0 a piece, the Colts would meet the first place Belleville Bulls in the conference finals. The Colts would need 7 games to beat Belleville for a trip to the OHL Championships. No one gave the Colts a chance at winning this series as they would play the defending champions London Knights. After 4 games, the Colts would lead the series 3 games to 1. At this point, injuries to Mark Scheifele and suspensions (10 games for Ryan O'Connor, 5 games for Anthony Camara, and 5 games for Jake Dotchin) would catch up with the Colts. London would win game 5 at home and game 6 in Barrie in thrilling fashion. In game 6 London would hold a 4–0 lead with just over 10 minutes left in the third period. The Colts stormed back to score 4 goals before losing in overtime. In game 7 Barrie headed back to London where the game was tied 2–2 in the dying seconds of the third period. A miscommunication between the Colts players led to a turnover, and a London goal with 0.1 seconds remaining on the clock to deny the Colts a trip to the Memorial Cup. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> <b>injury,</b> London was awarded the 2014 Memorial Cup early the next day; a tournament that Barrie also had a solid bid for.|$|E

50|$|The {{decade that}} {{followed}} the Jerry Olson era was one of mixed results. Olson's assistant Gene Murphy took over and coached the team in 1978 and 1979. Murphy's 1979 team qualified for the Division II playoffs, but fell in the quarterfinals to Mississippi College finishing {{the season with a}} 10-2 record. In 1980, Pat Behrns took over as head coach. Although he amassed a record of 36-27 in six seasons leading the program, North Dakota never qualified for the playoffs nor did they win a conference title under Behrns' direction. Following a dreadful 3-8 season in 1985 that culminated in a 49-0 loss to arch rival NDSU Bison, Behrns resigned as head coach of North Dakota. Roger Thomas was hired to replace him prior to the 1986 season. <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> what was already a forgettable decade in the annals of UND football history that yielded no conference titles and no playoff berths, 1980 marked the last time that the Sioux would defeat the rival NDSU Bison until 1993, twelve consecutive meetings.|$|R

6000|$|It may be {{said that}} of this hard lot no one has any reason to complain, because it befalls those only who are outstripped by others, from inferiority of energy or of prudence. This, even were it true, {{would be a very}} small {{alleviation}} of the evil. If some Nero or Domitian was to require a hundred persons to run a race for their lives, on condition that the fifty or twenty who came in hindmost should be put to death, it would not be any diminution of the injustice that the strongest or nimblest would, except through some untoward accident, be certain to escape. The misery and the crime would be that they were put to death at all. So in the economy of society; if there be any who suffer physical privation or moral degradation, whose bodily necessities are either not satisfied or satisfied in a manner which only brutish creatures can be content with, this, though not necessarily the crime of society, is pro tanto a failure of the social arrangements.

5000|$|Years later, a black ops {{arm of the}} CIA {{was formed}} to {{eliminate}} the notorious Carlos the Jackal and called Treadstone Seventy-One, named after a building on New York's Seventy-First Street, and Webb was called up by the creator of Treadstone and Medusa, David Abbott, who was nicknamed The Monk, (short for The Silent Monk of Covert Operations) to be its principal agent. At this point, Webb (Delta) takes the identity of Jason Bourne due to the actual Bourne's status as MIA in the war {{as well as the}} fact that Bourne was in reality a ruthless killer with a long criminal record. The point of all this was to turn Jason Bourne into something more than he really was, a contract assassin who would be known all over the world for terminating the lives of just about anyone. The assassin's alias was Cain. The reasoning for creating such a myth was to create competition for the well-known assassin named Carlos, or Carlos the Jackal (real name Ilich Ramírez Sánchez) who at that time was considered the world's best and most famous assassin. The name Cain was chosen because it had some significance for what he was doing. During Vietnam, Cain was used instead of Charlie in the phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot...) because Charlie became synonymous with Viet Cong. So Delta dropped back one letter to Cain, which stood for Charlie. In Spanish, Charlie is Carlos; Carlos was Venezuelan. The myth of Cain was created by having Cain take credit for any well-publicized killings that took place in Asia, and later in Europe, regardless of the circumstances. By creating this myth, Cain was to drive the reclusive Carlos out in the open [...] "long enough to put a bullet in his head". <b>To</b> <b>add</b> <b>insult</b> <b>to</b> Carlos's name, Cain stole the credit for Carlos's kills, even when Cain had no part in them.|$|R
