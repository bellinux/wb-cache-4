In November 1981, the EPB detonated {{explosives}} in AEE substations in Santurce, a district of San Juan. When 350 families that occupied a makeshift village in Carolina, Puerto Rico, were removed by the police, the EPB warned the governor that they would retaliate.

In Japan, Beebe was given two cranes by the Imperial Household in exchange for a pair of swans, which were unknown in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United was the highest-earning {{football}} {{club in the}} world for 2015–16, with an annual revenue of €689million, and the world's most valuable {{football club}} in 2017, valued at £2.86billion. As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2billion. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.

5|$|When {{the guns}} at Fort Nassau were {{heard by the}} attackers, they {{realized}} {{the element of surprise}} was lost and aborted the assault. The elements of the fleet then rejoined in Hanover Sound, about six nautical miles east of Nassau. There Hopkins held council, and a new plan of attack was developed. According to accounts now discredited, Hopkins' lieutenant, John Paul Jones, suggested a new landing point and then led the action. Jones was unfamiliar with the local waters, unlike many of the captains present in the council. It is more likely that the landing force was led by Cabot lieutenant, Thomas Weaver, who was also familiar with the area. With the force enlarged by 50 sailors, the three ships, with the Wasp offering additional covering support, carried it to a point south and east of Fort Montagu, where <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> unopposed landing between 12:00 and 2:00 pm. This was the first landing of what eventually became the United States Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|For many years, teams {{finishing}} at {{the bottom}} of the Football League had to apply for re-election to the League for the following seasonLincoln made eleven successful applicationsbut in the 1986–87 season, automatic promotion and relegation was introduced between the Conference National, the fifth tier of English football, and the Football League Fourth Division. Lincoln finished bottom of the 1986–87 Football League, thus becoming the first club automatically relegated from the League. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> immediate return as Conference champions, and until 2011 spent all but one season in the bottom League division. Lincoln reached the promotion play-offs in five consecutive seasons, between 2003 and 2007, but were unsuccessful on each occasion. The 2006–07 season marked Lincoln's 100th season in the Football League; they were the first club to reach that milestone without ever playing in the top division of the League. After a return of only two points from Lincoln's last 11 games of the 2010–11 season allowed Barnet to overturn an 11-point deficit, they returned to non-League football. Five successive bottom-half finishes in the Conference (renamed the National League for 2015–16) preceded Lincoln's return to the Football League as champions. They combined it with an FA Cup run in which they eliminated three Football League teams, including Championship-runners up Brighton & Hove Albion, before a 1–0 win away to Premier League club Burnley made them the first non-league club since 1913–14 to reach the quarter-finals; in the quarter-final, they lost 5–0 away to Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{was then}} given command of his prize, the Duquesne, on 2 March 1804, and sailed her from Jamaica to Chatham with only 160 men.

Duquesne arrived in England without incident, and Walker paid her off for repairs. He then received command of the 36-gun HMS Thalia on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and Quebec. The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly, with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure. The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates, which delivered the convoy, but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806. After setting sail Thalia became caught in a gale off the Newfoundland Banks and ran for 1250 miles for five days under bare poles. After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the Guernsey station under Sir Edmund Nagle, where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at St Malo.|$|E
