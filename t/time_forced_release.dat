50|$|In June 2011, The Air <b>Force</b> <b>Times</b> <b>released</b> the {{announcement}} of a summer weight ABU to be available in 2012. The Improved Airman Battle Uniform will be made of a 50-50 nylon-cotton blend and is the same material used by the Army for the ACU. Just like the ABU, the IABU is machine washable and also wrinkle resistant. Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Norton A. Schwartz gave approval of the IABU coat and pants which {{will be available to}} trainees at Basic Military Training first. No special allowance will be given to troops since they are not being forced to buy the uniform, although it will cost about the same as the current ABU.|$|R

30|$|In addition, the {{ligatures}} {{may change}} the <b>force</b> <b>released</b> due to loss of elasticity of the material, with time. A previous {{study found that the}} <b>force</b> <b>released</b> by “relaxed” elastomeric ligatures was higher than the new [12]. This probably occurs due to loss of friction with relaxation of the elastomer. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the force after a certain period of performance of elastomeric ligatures.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Metal Forces changed from their policy of {{balancing}} their articles between established and unknown bands, to a style which covered more mainstream and famed rock and heavy metal bands. The changes implemented were not profitable and the magazine lost readers and advertisers. In this period {{and for a}} brief <b>time,</b> Metal <b>Forces</b> launched the appreciated spin-off Thrash 'n Burn (later renamed Xtreme Noize). Metal <b>Forces</b> <b>released</b> seventy-two issues before rebranding under the abbreviated title of MF. The latter ceased publication in February 1993. As of 2012, Metal Forces launched its official website online, which has information from its magazine issues and new information and coverage of bands.|$|R

30|$|This {{concept of}} light and {{continuous}} forces is important because the <b>force</b> <b>released</b> for orthodontic movement is more biologically favorable, without damaging the surrounding tissues.

In this sense, leveling and alignment will be more efficient.|$|R

30|$|The ML {{produced}} greater {{forces in}} most tests. Even so, its <b>force</b> <b>release</b> behavior {{was similar to}} the SLB, where the forces constantly decreased as the deflection decreased. It is possible that the ML behaves as an active self-ligating bracket, with the difference that it allows less freedom of the wire within the slot, compared to other SLBs. On the other hand, the <b>force</b> <b>release</b> behavior of the EL {{is very different from the}} other ligation types, <b>releasing</b> very high <b>forces</b> in large deflections and very low forces in small deflections.|$|R

His subordinates Jen Scotts, Lucas Kendall, Katie Walker, and Trip travel back in time to 2001 and seek out Alex's ancestor Wes Collins, as his DNA unlocks the <b>Time</b> <b>Force</b> Morphers, allowing all of them to become the <b>Time</b> <b>Force</b> Power Rangers to recapture the mutants Ransik uses to thwart them and stop the Bio-Lab who ended up creating him.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical model for simulating {{the bond between}} steel and concrete, in precast prestressed concrete elements, during the prestressing <b>force</b> <b>release.</b> The model establishes a relationship between bond stress, steel and concrete stress and slip in such concrete structures. This relationship allows us to evaluate the bond stress in the transmission zone, where bond stress is not constant, along the whole prestressing <b>force</b> <b>release</b> process. The model is validated {{with the results of}} a series of tests and is extended to evaluate the transmission length. This capability has been checked by comparing the transmission length predicted by the model and one measured experimentally in a series of tests...|$|R
