25|$|I {{have always}} urged {{fighting}} wars and other contentions with might and main till overwhelming victory and then extending {{the hand of}} friendship to the vanquished. Thus I have always been against the Pacifists during the quarrel and the Jingoist at its close...I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have conquered the Irish then given them Home Rule...and that after smashing the General Strike we should have met the grievances of the miners.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had some}} criticisms of Dark Side of the Moon…" [...] noted David Gilmour. [...] "One {{or two of}} the {{vehicles}} carrying the ideas were not as strong as the ideas that they carried. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> try and work harder on marrying the idea and the vehicle that carried it, so that they both had an equal magic… It's something I was personally pushing when we made Wish You Were Here." ...|$|E
500|$|Heated discussions {{during the}} writing of Lions were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. [...] "Soul Singing" [...] was the only song to cause disagreement; [...] "I'd written this part where {{although}} the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. [...] I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one. [...] So we talked about that one for a while", Rich recalled.|$|E

500|$|On March 6, 2014, Big Sean {{released}} his verse {{for the song}} that was cut from the album version of the song. Detailing the song's recording process to MTV, Big Sean said, [...] "Me and [...] was in the studio working on {{a whole bunch of}} ideas and [...] came in the conversation. And everybody know Rick Ross albums is events. So Ye pulled a track up, and I was telling him I think it's a banger, it's a smash, and he <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> give it to Rozay. Me and him wrote our verses on the spot and we sent it to [...] and he did what he did to it." ...|$|E
500|$|In native Sweden, [...] "Dressed for Success" [...] and [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] {{were chosen}} as the first two singles from their second album Look Sharp!, as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to {{highlight}} Fredriksson's singing. Gessle said, [...] "I always <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> promote the songs Marie sang. Me being a lead singer wasn't part of the plan, not for me anyway." [...] Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart, while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No.1 position for 14 weeks. Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: [...] "To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle's once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense." [...] But the album won Roxette their first Rockbjörnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2008, Square Enix {{announced}} that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. [...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
6000|$|Holmes took a half-sovereign {{from his}} pocket and played with it pensively. [...] "We <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> like to hear it all from your own lips," [...] he said.|$|R

6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, leaning {{upon the}} mantelshelf and {{looking down at}} the gas flames, [...] "I've never <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all have to live in this crowded house for long." ...|$|R
500|$|The new {{material}} for the album saw her collaboration with a well-known producer David Foster, {{who had worked with}} the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster recalled the first time Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg contacting him for a dinner with the singer: [...] "When Madonna first called, I was a little surprised—my music isn't really hip enough for her—but I guess her camp <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> meet, and I got a call from Liz Rosenberg, the PR maven who has been with Madonna from the beginning." [...] Not long after the dinner, Madonna and Foster began the recording session in his Malibu studio. During the album conception, Madonna was also asked by her Bedtime Stories producer Nellee Hooper to collaborate with British trip hop group Massive Attack for a Marvin Gaye tribute album. Previously, the band had offered the collaboration to several artists, including Chaka Khan who rejected it. Madonna and Massive Attack covered Gaye's 1976 hit [...] "I Want You", which finished among the {{new material}} for Something to Remember and was also included on the [...] released by Motown Records.|$|E
500|$|Beghe {{played an}} ice hockey {{star in the}} Perry Mason TV film The Case of the All-Star Assassin, an NBC-TV telefeature {{broadcast}} November 19, 1989. In 1991 he played a State Trooper in the film Thelma & Louise (reuniting him with Sarandon, with whom he'd appeared in Compromising Positions), and was Demi Moore's love interest in the 1997 film G.I. Jane. He had recurring roles on Picket Fences and Melrose Place, and became a cast member of Chicago Hope in 1997, portraying electrician Danny Blaines opposite romantic interest Dr. Austin played by Christine Lahti. In a 1997 interview in The Boston Herald, Beghe spoke about his respect for his fellow cast members in Chicago Hope: [...] "I think it's the best cast assembled that I've ever seen. One for one, they're incredible. And to work with Christine Lahti? I'd drop {{a lot of things}} for that. She's so good and smart and dedicated. I've become a better actor just for working with her." [...] He commented on his character on Melrose Place, a closeted military officer who had feelings for Matt, played by Doug Savant: [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> kiss, but it was too much. TV is a very specific medium, and you're naive if you think that everything is just based on artistic decisions. If it prevents them from selling some products, that's a major consideration. But I'm an actor. I'll do whatever it takes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on [...] "(And She Said) Take Me Now", a {{song from}} his debut solo album Justified which was {{initially}} planned to be released as a single, commenting [...] "I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. I mean, she sounds like an angel." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} her hand, {{and then they}} sat down. 'They said you were dead,' {{continued}} Lucy, 'but I never <b>thought</b> so. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> have heard of it for certain if you had been.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; we all speak Dutch fairly, {{and most}} of us Kaffir also, that was why <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be more useful scouting; until now we have all been dressed as young Boers, and could, I think, pass without {{suspicion}} anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I don't {{like the}} idea of having strange men prowling around the house in the night; but there is nothing here for them to steal, and I am certain they couldn't be wicked enough to hurt a poor old woman like me. Instead of {{harbouring}} revengeful <b>thoughts,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> endeavour to do good to those who would injure us, remembering the words spoken on the Mount, 'That ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Stephenson {{was very}} much one of the {{professionals}} and even as captain had little time for the stuffier county cricket element. There were run-ins with the county establishment. Cricket writer David Foot in an obituary of Stephenson reported [...] "one corrosive exchange with the county chairman, Bunty Longrigg". Foot reports Stephenson as saying: [...] "It was my fifth year in charge and we'd got to the Bath Festival. The chairman approached {{me and asked me}} bluntly who I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> leave out to make way for an amateur or two. I bristled and told him that if he had plans to make changes, he had better skipper the county himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now {{in order}} to give these evangelistic {{physicians}} standing in the world, it was <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> secure a charter for the school, which would enable it to grant degrees to all who finished the prescribed course of study. Many, no doubt, would enter the field without waiting to secure a degree, possibly after studying one or two years, as there are many fields in which they could labor freely as medical missionary evangelists without a degree. But from the instruction in the testimonies, we understand that some should qualify as fully accredited physicians, hence the school should plan its course accordingly... (LLM 7.2)" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{captain of}} the {{national}} side, Wessels was similarly criticised for playing too conservatively in South Africa's first test series since readmission into international cricket. Although South Africa won the home series against India by 1–0, fans and critics sharpened their pencils and attacked the captain mercilessly for his team's apparent lack of passion and ambition. The fourth test in Cape Town, in particular, was condemned across the cricketing world. The two teams scored a total of 795 runs in 433.4 overs, {{at an average of}} only 1.83 runs per over and ended in a draw. Wessels commented on the criticism in his biography, saying: [...] "It was almost as if they <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> win every series 4–0. They simply don't understand that modern Test cricket is tough and competitive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{horsemen}} {{stayed here}} till {{within a few}} minutes of your arrival. No doubt they <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> suppose they had all gone, and might venture out, and let them get a shot at us." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2016, the Republican Party {{offered the}} band $100,000 {{to play at}} a concert {{launching}} the 2016 Republican National Convention. [...] Zander said, [...] "We turned it down. Then <b>we</b> had second <b>thoughts.</b> Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have accepted it — but we would all have got swastika guitars made." ...|$|R
6000|$|Quoth Antony, [...] "If {{the baker}} did not cover the mill-horse's eyes he would eat the corn, {{and take his}} own wages. So God covers our eyes, by leaving us to sordid <b>thoughts,</b> lest <b>we</b> <b>should</b> think of our own good works, and be puffed up in spirit." ...|$|R
2500|$|The show held auditions in Dublin and Belfast for {{the first}} three series, with Belfast auditions {{continuing}} for series 4 before being dropped, though Irish singers could still audition in other cities. Dublin first round auditions returned in 2010 with the auditions held on 28 June. In 2011, The X Factor did not hold auditions in Ireland, instead replacing them with a new audition city, Liverpool. A source from The X Factor said: [...] "There are only so many places we can go for auditions. We went to Dublin last year but we haven't been to Liverpool so we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do it this year. Obviously this is a blow to the Irish contestants but it's only a short hop across the Irish Sea to Liverpool." [...] Auditions did return to Dublin in 2014, however.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, she {{divorced}} Steve Newkirk, {{whom she}} had married when she was 19, and the same year met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. Pacheco had studied for the priesthood, then worked as a crew member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's first ship. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and {{they fell in love}} and began living together, although as Kathy Snow Guillermo writes, they were very different—Newkirk was older and more practical, whereas Pacheco could barely look after himself. Newkirk read Peter Singer's influential book, Animal Liberation (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just [...] "five people in a basement", as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who {{went on to become the}} national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. Pacheco was reluctant at first. [...] "It just didn't sound great to me," [...] he told The Los Angeles Times in 1992. [...] "I had been active in Europe ... and I thought there were just too many formalities. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> just do things ourselves. But she made a convincing case that Washington needed a vehicle for animals because the current organizations were too conservative." ...|$|E

"My dearest creature, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> never <b>should</b> get here, for Papa had a {{tiresome}} dinner party, {{and we were}} {{obliged to}} stay, you know," [...] cried Rose, the lively sister, shaking out the pretty dress and glancing {{at herself in the}} mirror as she fluttered about the room like a butterfly.|$|R
6000|$|... "The moon {{will come}} out again presently," [...] he said, when George had {{followed}} his example. [...] "She has got behind that thunder-cloud. Ah!"

5000|$|During the trial's ninth {{hearing on}} November 5, 2012, defense lawyer İbrahim Gök {{requested}} a media ban on all further hearings. Prosecuting attorney Cem Halavurt rejected the proposal stating that [...] "If {{there is a}} press ban in this court, will Turkey stop talking about the Armenian issue? Or will people not talk about deaths in the army? This is why we demand that the press ban be overruled. Even if we don't like certain <b>thoughts,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> treat {{them as part of}} free speech in a democratic society." [...] İbrahim Gök claimed that the trial was becoming [...] "politicized" [...] and that the case {{has nothing to do with}} the events of 1915 (referring to the Armenian Genocide). The request for a press ban was rejected.|$|R
