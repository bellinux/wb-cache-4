25|$|In mid-2014, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Intelligence Service {{obtained}} {{information that}} ISIL had assets worth US$2 billion, {{making it the}} richest jihadist group in the world.

25|$|While {{the regular}} army was being formed, U.S. commanders {{around the country}} needed {{additional}} troops more quickly, and thus the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (which became <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Guard by July 2004) was formed. Coalition commanders formed these militia-type units separately in each area; only later were they gradually brought together as one force. There were several instances where they have refused to take military action against fellow Iraqis, such as in Fallujah, deserted, or allegedly aided the resistance. It is alleged that most guardsmen were drawn from the Shia majority in Southern Iraq or the Kurdish majority in northern Iraq, {{rather than from the}} Sunni area which they were ordered to attack. In September 2004, {{a senior member of the}} National Guard, General Talib al-Lahibi was arrested on suspicion of having links with insurgent groups. In December 2004, it was announced that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Guard would be dissolved. At this time its strength was officially over 40,000 men. Its units became part of the army. The absorption of the ING by the regular army appears to have taken place on January 6, 2005, Iraqi Army Day.|$|E
25|$|The Defense Department is {{expected}} to send 250 MRAPs to Iraq to bolster <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Security Forces against Islamic State militants. Iraqi forces were equipped with MRAPs after the U.S. withdrawal in 2011, but many were captured by ISIL during the June 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, and subsequently destroyed later by American air strikes. The vehicles will likely be transferred, rather than sold, as excess defense articles and {{be drawn from the}} U.S. stock of 1,500 MRAPs stored in Kuwait. Of the 250 vehicles, 225 will go to Iraqi Security Forces, while 25 will be given to Kurdish Peshmerga forces.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, {{an interim}} {{constitution}} was created, called the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period. The document {{called for the}} creation of an elected National Assembly to take place no later than January 2005. The question of the election calendar became a matter of importance for Iraq and the U.S.: while a quick election would legitimise the Iraqi government and shed a favourable light on the U.S.-led occupation of the country, the prospect of violence delayed it. It was finally set for 30 January 2005. Though then-President Ghazi Al-Yaouar asked the United Nations to reconsider the electoral schedule several weeks before the election, the legislative election was held on time, creating <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Assembly.|$|E

25|$|In February 2004 the U.S {{government}} announced that Nour USA {{was awarded a}} $327,485,798 contract to procure equipment for both the Iraqi Army and <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Guard; however, this contract was canceled in March 2004 when an internal Army investigation (initiated due to complaints from losing bidders) revealed that Army procurement officers in Iraq were violating procedures with sloppy contract language and incomplete paperwork. On May of that same year the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) stated that they would award a contract worth $259,321,656 to ANHAM Joint Venture in exchange for procuring the necessary equipment (and providing its required training) {{for a minimum of}} 15 and a maximum of 35 battalions.

2500|$|As of {{the early}} 2010s, the chocolate-chip pattern is still in {{widespread}} use across the world, long after the United States abandoned it. A uniform similar to the Desert Battle Dress Uniform was issued to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Guard before it was dissolved in 2004 and to the Iraqi security forces. South Korean forces have used, in limited numbers since 1993, a variant with brown replacing the black in the American design; this South Korean design has also been tested in the United Arab Emirates. The Oman National Guard use a pattern mixing chocolate-chip with 'amoeba', while the National Guards of both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait use a grey variation on the chocolate-chip design. The Saudis also use a grey, black, and white 'urban' variation and the police wear a blue {{version of the same}} design; Palestinian police also use a blue chocolate-chip patterned uniform.

[...] According to Kampfner, the CIA had ended its funding of the INC [...] "in the mid-1990s when doubts were cast about Chalabi’s reliability." [...] Nevertheless, [...] "as the administration geared up for conflict with Saddam, Chalabi was welcomed in the inner sanctum of the Pentagon" [...] under the auspices of the OSP, and [...] "Wolfowitz did not see fit to challenge any of Chalabi’s information."

2500|$|Nouri al-Maliki was at loggerheads {{with the}} leader of ethnic Kurds, who brandished the threat of secession in a growing row over the {{symbolic}} issue of flying <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>national</b> flag at government buildings in the autonomous Kurdish north. Maliki's Arab Shi'ite-led government was locked in a dispute with the autonomous Kurdish regional government, which has banned {{the use of the}} Iraqi state flag on public buildings. The prime minister issued a blunt statement on Sunday saying: [...] "The Iraqi flag is the only flag that should be raised over any square inch of Iraq." [...] But Mesud Barzani, president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region, told the Kurdish parliament the national leadership were [...] "failures" [...] and that the Iraqi flag was a symbol of his people's past oppression by Baghdad: [...] "If at any moment we, the Kurdish people and parliament, consider that it is in our interests to declare independence, we will do so and we will fear no one." [...] The dispute exposes a widening rift between Arabs and Kurds, the second great threat to Iraq's survival as a state after the growing sectarian conflict between Arab Sunnis and Shi'ites.|$|E
