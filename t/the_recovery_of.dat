Relative standard deviations for within-laboratory repeatability (RSDr, n = 7) range from 1.6 to 2.6. <b>The</b> <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mineral elements {{were in the order}} of 97.6 % to 98.4 %.

Different levels of light irradiation (4, 40 and 400 mu mol photon m(2) s(- 1)) displayed different effects on <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> process <b>of</b> photosynthesis. <b>The</b> intermediate level led to <b>the</b> best <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> photochemical efficiency; <b>the</b> low light required longer and the high light inhibited {{the extent of the}} recovered efficiency.

Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested.

5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, <b>the</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{study of}} the matrix effect was {{performed}} in order to evaluate the influence of some matrices on the gas chromatographic responses of representative organophosphorus insecticides. Particularly, 3 fortification levels and the Maximum Residual Level (MRL) of 4 organophosphorus pesticide standard solutions were added in 18 matrices (15 belonging to 5 specific botanical categories and 3 botanically unclassified). <b>The</b> <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> examined pesticides were determined using a simple official multiresidue method of detection, without any additional clean–up step. Recoveries were estimated based on standards prepared in solvent. <b>The</b> <b>recovery</b> percentages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most polar pesticides, especially methamidophos (20. 2 – 288. 4 %), were much {{higher than those of}} non polar ones (chlorpyrifos and methidathion 25. 7 – 136. 4 % and 37. 6 – 292. 6 % respectively), except for quince. Pronounced matrix effects (> 120 %) were observed to the lowest fortification levels (MRLs established by EU), of dimethoate and methamidophos (i. e. the most polar analytes) in the majority of product extracts. Furthermore, it was proved that there is no correlation between the classification of plant products, according to their botanical characteristics, and <b>the</b> <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> pesticides in <b>the</b> equivalent extracts. Indeed, there were significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>recoveries</b> <b>of</b> pesticides in extracts, derived from matrices belonging to the same botanical group (especially in the categories of pome fruits and citrus). Consequently, it was shown that, under the examined conditions, obtaining recovery data, derived from only one representative matrix, with purpose to validate an official method in its botanical category is, possibly, an erroneous practice...|$|R
