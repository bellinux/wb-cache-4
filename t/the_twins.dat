5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved <b>the</b> <b>twins</b> as small children from Mandhiyappan.

He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E

The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed <b>the</b> <b>twins</b> clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items.

40|$|The {{effect of}} basal plate {{precipitates}} on the hardening of basal slip and { 101 ¯ 2 } twinning modes was investigated for a non-aged and aged AZ 91 alloy in <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> dominated strain paths. Exploiting in-situ synchrotron and laboratory based X-ray diffraction methodologies, we quantified the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for basal slip and <b>twinning</b> modes. <b>The</b> <b>twin</b> volume fraction changes were quantified from the intensity changes with applied load. We observed that <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> volume fraction changes with plastic strain {{is sensitive to}} the initial texture, while the relative hardening of different deformation modes are considered as a secondary effect. We also found that <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> interior stresses were significantly smaller and consistent with <b>the</b> high <b>twin</b> back stresses {{in the presence of}} precipitates. We propose, based on a simple analytical equation, that the leading edge of <b>the</b> propagating <b>twin</b> have a Burgers vector equivalent to 100 twinning dislocations and when <b>the</b> propagating <b>twin</b> is blocked by a precipitate, relatively high resolved stress is required for bowing <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> dislocation and hence the propagation of <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> occurs by <b>the</b> dissociation of the leading edge of <b>the</b> <b>twinning</b> dislocation...|$|R
