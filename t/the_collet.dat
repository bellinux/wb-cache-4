25|$|An {{internal}} collet {{can be used}} to lock two telescoping tubes together. In {{this case}} <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> {{is in the form of}} a truncated cone drilled and threaded down the centreline. <b>The</b> <b>collet</b> diameter matches the bore of the inner tube, having the larger end slightly greater than the bore while the smaller diameter is slightly less than the bore. A threaded stud, anchored at its other end to the tube, is then used to pull <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> into the tube. The increasing diameter of <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> forces the inner tube to expand and be pushed against the inner wall of the outer tube thus locking the two tubes together. The inner tube is often slotted to facilitate this expansion.|$|E
25|$|In use, {{the part}} {{to be held}} is {{inserted}} into <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> and then <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> is driven (using a nose cap) or drawn (using a drawbar) into the body which has a matching taper.

25|$|Generally, a collet chuck, {{considered}} as a unit, consists of a tapered receiving sleeve (sometimes integral with the machine spindle), <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> proper (usually made of spring steel) which is inserted into the receiving sleeve, and (often) a cap that screws over <b>the</b> <b>collet,</b> clamping it via another taper.|$|E
50|$|The Gyromax balance has six {{to eight}} small {{turnable}} weights that fit on pins located in recesses {{around the top of}} the balance wheel rim. Each of <b>the</b> weights, called <b>collets,</b> has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When <b>the</b> <b>collet's</b> cutout points to the outside of the balance wheel, the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When <b>the</b> <b>collet's</b> cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the balance wheel turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual <b>collet</b> to adjust <b>the</b> wheel's balance, referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing <b>collets</b> to adjust <b>the</b> wheel's rotation speed. The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the wheel's balance spring for adjusting the watch's rate, so <b>the</b> <b>collets</b> are used for adjusting both poise and rate.|$|R

The FEA revealed stress raisers at both the button-head and the transition from the gage section to the shank. However, the stress field within the bulk of the gage section is uniform and uniaxial. The stress ratio, kt, between the button-head and gage section stresses varied from 0. 35 to 0. 72 for <b>the</b> tapered <b>collet</b> or <b>the</b> straight <b>collet</b> systems, respectively.

25|$|Unlike {{most other}} machine collet systems, 5C collets were {{developed}} primarily for work holding.

25|$|The spindle router is {{positioned}} at the finer {{end of the}} scale of work done by a moulding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge moulding, and chamfer or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints.

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
25|$|Bits {{also differ}} by the {{diameter}} of their shank, with ½ inch, 12mm, 10mm, ⅜inch, 8mm and ¼ inch and 6mm shanks (ordered from thickest to thinnest) being the most common. Half-inch bits cost more but, being stiffer, are less prone to vibration (giving smoother cuts) and {{are less likely to}} break than the smaller sizes. Care must be taken to ensure the bit shank and router collet sizes match exactly. Failure to do so can cause permanent damage to either or both and can lead to the dangerous situation of the bit coming out of <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> during operation. Many routers come with removable collets for the popular shank sizes (in the USA ½-in and ¼-in, in Great Britain ½-in, 8mm and ¼-in, and metric sizes in Europe—although in the United States the ⅜-in and 8mm sizes are often only available for extra cost).|$|E

50|$|The Blaser R8 straight-pull {{bolt action}} locks by a 14-lug radial collet in a 360 degrees groove in the barrel and is {{designed}} to withstand pressures significantly exceeding the Mauser 98-type bolt-action rifles. The Blaser R8 displays a locking surface of 96 mm2 compared to 56 mm2 for the Mauser 98. The stressed parts are made out of hammer forged steel and plasma nitrided to make the locking mechanism work. Compared to the preceding R93 rifle series for additional safety the barrel has been thickened at the critical part, the groove has been enlarged and the locking angle of <b>the</b> <b>collets</b> has been steepened. Further <b>the</b> radial <b>collet</b> opens differently. <b>The</b> thus improved lockup of the R8 series comes {{at the price of}} a less smooth operating bolt when compared to the R93 series and some weight increase.|$|R

Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> design, the operating principle is the same: squeeze <b>the</b> <b>collet</b> against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction.|$|E
