5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> of the rods.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
40|$|The Thumb Rule of Leonardo da Vinci {{states that}} many {{proportions}} of the face show relationship with <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of thumb which is measured from the proximal tip of the proximal phalanx to the distal tip of the distal phalanx. Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO) is similar to <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of thumb of the Caucasoid race. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of VDO have correlations with <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of thumb among those of the Mongoloid race. This study took a survey method with the analytical cross-sectional approach. A total of 80 students of Faculty of Dentistry who have fulfilled all population criteria were randomly chosen to measure <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of VDO and <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> thumb. Results analyzed with Student's t-test statistic revealed that there was a significant difference between males and females in <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of VDO and <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> thumb, however, there was no significant difference between <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of VDO and <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> thumb. There were very strong correlations (P< 0. 05) between <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of VDO and <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> thumb. As a conclusion, <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of thumb can be suggested as an objective method to determine <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of VDO in this population...|$|R

5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, {{of which}} Britain was a signatory, did not ban {{submarines}} {{but it did}} ban their use against merchant ships, which was X1s unacknowledged purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as destroyers and frigates.

5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|The spores of G.pectinatum are {{brown and}} opaque.

Spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 2- or 4-spored, while cystidia (specialized sterile cells that {{occur at the}} hymenial surface in some mushrooms) are absent. The capillitia—a mass of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores—are light brown and 3–7µm in diameter. They are tapered, thick-walled with a narrow interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted.|$|E

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> that companies must go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. <b>The</b> <b>lengths</b> of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E

5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale differences among various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 22, 1910. The production was a split reel, containing both Her Battle for Existence and Sand Man's Cure, with an estimated length of 1000 feet.
