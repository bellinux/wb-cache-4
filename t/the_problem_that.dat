5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that,</b> if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E
5|$|Drainage schemes {{were first}} {{authorised}} {{during the reign}} of Queen Elizabeth I, but from 1632, a group of Adventurers took control of the drainage, in return for which they were granted land. They faced <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> the outfalls of the River Welland and the River Glen were not sufficiently low to enable proper drainage by gravity, and most schemes included improvement to the rivers. John Perry, an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, began work in 1730, and was followed by John Grundy, Sr., a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems. His son, John Grundy, Jr., was another capable engineer, who was retained as a consultant after he resigned as full-time Surveyor of Works.|$|E
5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} version of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a {{subset of the}} squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.|$|E
5|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> Bach's congratulatory cantata was a dialogue of tenor and alto by retaining a dialogue in three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes to {{the news of the}} Resurrection of Jesus, which may be found in the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, CART {{encountered}} problems {{in promoting the}} race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to drain water.|$|E

25|$|In case {{of balance}} of {{payments}} imbalances, Keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. As outlined by Keynes, countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to them—and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. Thus, Keynes was sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> placing {{too much of the}} burden on the deficit country would be deflationary.|$|E

25|$|To explain stellar {{aberration}} in {{the context}} of an aether-based theory of light was regarded as more problematic. As the aberration relied on relative velocities, and the measured velocity was dependent on the motion of the Earth, the aether had to be remaining stationary with respect to the star as the Earth moved through it. This meant that the Earth could travel through the aether, a physical medium, with no apparent effect – precisely <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> led Newton to reject a wave model in the first place.|$|E

25|$|It was the Sector Controls {{that were}} {{responsible}} for communication with the pilots, as well as barrage balloon and anti-aircraft batteries, providing early warning of {{the approach of the}} enemy or warning them not to fire on friendlies. To combat <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>that</b> the fighter pilots tended to ignore orders from paper pushers, Sector Commanders were normally former pilots themselves, either retired or on medical leave. Dowding, Blackett and Tizard personally drove home the fact that the pilots could not simply hunt for their targets, and had to follow the instructions of the operations centres.|$|E
