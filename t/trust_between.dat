5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and <b>trust</b> <b>between</b> the different communities.|$|E
5|$|His 1555 {{election}} for Marlborough was similar, but {{more dependent on}} influential connections. Pleydell's father had once leased the lands of Thomas Seymour in the nearby parish of Eastrop (and possibly Preshute), establishing a relationship of <b>trust</b> <b>between</b> the families. After Seymour's brother Edward was executed in 1552, his widow Anne inherited the responsibility of maintaining the vast estates. The Duchess appointed Pleydell as chief ranger of Savernake Forest (then under her ownership) before 1554 and as her receiver general that year. His position as ranger probably led to the acquisition of property in Chippenham and Preshute, and {{his status as a}} Preshute landholder assisted him in becoming Member for Marlborough. Pleydell, serving with Sir Andrew Baynton, replaced Peter Taylor alias Perce and John Broke of the 1554 session; they were succeeded by William Daniell and William Fleetwood in 1558 after a parliamentary hiatus following the death of Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|In total, the Central Recreation Ground hosted 228 {{first-class}} matches, and 14 List A matches. The {{ground was}} initially leased from the Cornwallis family (the descendants of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis), until 1869 when {{the ground was}} purchased by the cricketing <b>trust.</b> <b>Between</b> 1887 and the 1960s, the ground hosted the Hastings & St. Leonards Festival in September, which was the southern equivalent of the Scarborough Festival. During these festivals, seven Gentlemen v Players matches were played on the ground between 1889 and 1903, and in 1907 & 1909, matches took place between Gentlemen of the South and Players of the South. The 1909 match was the only first-class match played by British Army officer Leonard Slater, and was {{a victory for the}} Players of the South by 228 runs.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, a royal {{letter was}} {{received}} from the Maharaja Ranjit Singh, ruler of Sikh Empire in Punjab, addressed to King Rajendra. The Nepalese court seized this opportunity to establish diplomatic contact with Punjab {{as well as other}} states such as Burma and Gwalior. In April 1835, Bhimsen also hatched a plan to make a state visit to Britain, hoping to force Britain to acknowledge the sovereignty of Nepal; but since he could not make the visit himself, his nephew Colonel Mathabar Singh Thapa was chosen as the representative of Nepal, bearing a few gifts and a letter from King Rajendra addressed to King William IV. The idea was initially received favorably by Hodgson as well as the Governor-General, who hoped that the mission could increase the <b>trust</b> <b>between</b> the two nations. In this process, Mathabar Singh was promoted to Chota General; his brother, Ranbir Singh, the governor of Palpa, was made Full General; and Mathabar's nephew, the sixteen-year-old Sherjung Thapa, was made Commanding Colonel. Thus, Bhimsen managed to consolidate his military powers. Both Rajendra and Samrajya Laxmi were also pleased with this plan, and on 1 November 1835, Bhimsen was conferred the title of Commander-in-Chief. On 27 November 1835, Mathabar Singh left Kathmandu with a retinue of two thousand men, including 200 officers and 600 soldiers, for London via Calcutta.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the German Army was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen {{was supposed to have}} been captured on the first day of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive were in the midst of destroying the German Army Group Centre. In France, the German Army had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of the German Army, including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little <b>trust</b> <b>between</b> Hitler and his generals.|$|E
