40|$|The {{equatorial}} anomaly dynamics is {{very difficult}} to study due to necessity of its monitoring in space (latitude-longitude) and local time simultaneously. This task is impossible for the single-point measurements, and only the satellite technology may help. The present paper is devoted to the preliminary analysis of the equatorial anomaly dynamics combining two techniques - the <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> and GPS TEC measurements. The <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> gives the unique opportunity to build the global structure of the equatorial anomaly for the fixed local time (LT-maps) and to reveal the longitudinal variations, while the chains of GPS receivers along the meridian permit to study the latitudinal variations of TEC in local time. Two meridional chains of GPS receivers were selected: at 115 deg. E and 70 deg. W longitudes. Combining of two technologies makes it possible to obtain three-dimensional global dynamics of the equatorial anomaly. The paper demonstrates the power of the technique itself while the more detailed and comprehensive analysis will be continued in the following papers...|$|E

To 'calibrate' the former as a means of studying the ionosphere and solar wind interaction, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter radio occultation experiment results are examined in light of what is known from in situ plasma and magnetic field data. This calibration can be used to reassess the data from previous Mars missions and to provide a basis for interpreting data from the upcoming Phobos mission...|$|E

Unfolding the satellite data from the tropical F region yields altitude and latitude variations of the O(1 S) emissions. The spatial variations of the tropical F-region electron density are then calculated by assuming dissociative recombination and using a model atmosphere. Where comparisons to ground based data are possible the results are good. Thus, the satellite observations constitute a form of <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> of the ionosphere below the F peak and provide synoptic data about {{this portion of the}} ionosphere that are otherwise impractical to obtain...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{detection}} of O+ ion fluxes from <b>topside</b> <b>soundings</b> is described. The shape of the plasma scale-height profile is altered by such flows only at heights near the F 2 -peak, where ion-neutral drag is large. Model profiles are used to relate changes in scale height to the ratio (φ/φL) where φ is the field-aligned O+ flux (relative to the neutral air) and φL is the limiting value set by frictional drag. Values of (φ/φL) can then be determined to within a few per cent from experimental soundings, using the plasma temperature and its gradient (as deduced from the observed profile) and the MSIS model neutral temperature. It was found that 3700 topside profiles show departures from diffusive equilibrium, out of 10, 000 used to obtain the global morphology of (φ/φL) near the sunspot minimum. Results reveal dynamic ion-flow effects such as the transequatorial breeze and the effects of the polar wind and protonospheric replenishment light-ion flows can be inferred...|$|R

A departure from diffusive equilibrium alters {{the shape of}} the plasma scale-height profile near the F 2 -peak where ion-neutral frictional drag is large. The effect enables the evaluation of, the field-aligned flux of O+ ions relative to the neutral oxygen atom gas, using MSIS model values for the neutral thermospheric densities and temperature. Upward flow values are accurate to within about 10 %, the largest sources of error being the MSIS prediction for the concentration of oxygen atoms and the plasma temperature gradient deduced from the sounding. Downward flux values are only determined to within 20 %. From 60, 000 <b>topside</b> <b>soundings,</b> taken at the minimum and rising phase of the solar cycle, a total of 1098 mean scale-height profiles are identified for which no storm sudden commencement had occurred in the previous 12 days and for which Kp was less than 2 o, each mean profile being an average of about six soundings. A statistical study ofdeduced from these profiles shows the diurnal cycle of O+ flow in the quiet, topside ionosphere at mid-latitudes and its seasonal variations.

The mean interhemispheric flow from summer to winter is compared with predictions by a numerical model of the protonospheric coupling of conjugate ionospheres for up to 6 days following a geomagnetic storm. The observed mean (of order 3 × 1016 ions day− 1 along a flux tube of area 1 m 2 at 1000 km) is larger than predicted for day 6 and the suggested explanation is a decrease in upward flows from the winter, daytime ionosphere between the sixth and twelfth days...|$|R

40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{technique is}} presented for {{the determination of}} the total electron content (TEC) below a low-orbiting satellite. According to this technique TEC can be obtained using the segment of a topside ionogram that only contains the traces of signals reflected from the Earth's surface. Possibilities of this technique were demonstrated using MIR station <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> data at the night time for both quiet and disturbed ionospheric conditions, and in particular, during the 14 November 1998 storm. An interesting fact was revealed with the help of this technique: after a series of relatively strong storms the main ionospheric trough on 14 November 1998 was detected at an abnormally low geomagnetic latitude (~ 43 &deg;). During this study some spatial variations of TEC were registered that can be interpreted as a TID-type wave structure...|$|E

The concept of absolute phase is intro-duced. Some qualitative results from multipath communication experiments are given. Radar applications, including <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> and ground penetrating radar is presented.

40|$|The {{potential}} difference near 280 kV exists between ground and ionosphere. This {{potential difference}} {{is generated by}} thunderstorm discharges all over the world, and return current closes the circuit {{in the areas of}} fair weather (so-called fair weather current). The model calculations and experimental measurements clearly demonstrate non-uniform latitude-longitude distribution of electric field within the atmosphere. The recent calculations show that the strong large scale vertical atmospheric electric field can penetrate into the ionosphere and create large scale irregularities of the electron concentration. To check this the global distributions of thunderstorm activity obtained with the satellite monitoring for different seasons were compared with the global distributions of ionosphere critical frequency (which is equivalent to peak electron concentration) obtained with the help of satellite <b>topside</b> <b>sounding.</b> The similarity of the obtained global distributions clearly demonstrates the effects of thunderstorm electric fields onto the Earth's ionosphere...|$|E

An analytical expression is obtained, which relates the variance of deduced parameters to the correlation function of errors in measured characteristics of sounding signals. The computer simulation is provided for errors in real height determination; in reconstruction of vertical velocities of plasma motion; and in effective electron collision frequencies for the measurements of virtual heights, Doppler shift, and radio wave absorption, respectively. Their dependencies on signal polarisation, working frequency range, and geomagnetic latitude of the observation point are determined. The obtained results are useful for planning plasma experiments using HF sounding technique...|$|R
40|$|The CubeSat for GNSS Sounding of Ionosphere-Plasmasphere Electron Density (CuSPED) is a 3 U CubeSat mission {{concept that}} has been {{developed}} {{in response to the}} NASA Heliophysics program's decadal science goal of the determining of the dynamics and coupling of the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere and their response to solar and terrestrial inputs. The mission was formulated through a collaboration between West Virginia University, Georgia Tech, NASA GSFC and NASA JPL, and features a 3 U CubeSat that hosts both a miniaturized space capable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver for <b>topside</b> atmospheric <b>sounding,</b> along with a Thermal Electron Capped Hemispherical Spectrometer (TECHS) for the purpose of in situ electron precipitation measurements. These two complimentary measurement techniques will provide data for the purpose of constraining ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling models and will also enable studies of the local plasma environment and spacecraft charging; a phenomenon which is known to lead to significant errors in the measurement of low-energy, charged species from instruments aboard spacecraft traversing the ionosphere. This paper will provide an overview of the concept including its science motivation and implementation...|$|R
40|$|The {{modelling}} of the Total Electron Content (TEC) {{plays an}} important role in global satellite navigation systems (GNSS) accuracy, especially for single frequency receivers, the most common ones constituting the mass market. For the latter and in the framework of Galileo, the NeQuick model has been chosen for correcting the ionospheric error contribution. It has been designed to calculate the electron density at a given point of the ionosphere according to the time conditions and the solar activity. This electron density can be integrated along the path from the receiver to the considered satellite to provide the TEC. For Galileo, a parameter Az (“effective ionisation level”) will be provided to the model as solar activity information and will be daily updated by the ground stations. In order to reach the ionosphere error correction level objective (70 % or 20 TECu whichever is larger), the model itself as well as its use for Galileo are investigated. Different situations have to be considered: different latitude regions (space conditions), different hours, seasons and years (time conditions) and specific phenomena appearance (magnetic storms, Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances – TIDs). In addition the results can be compared to different data sets among which GPS slant or vertical TEC (sTEC or vTEC) measurements, Global Ionospheric Maps, ionosonde profiles, <b>topside</b> <b>soundings</b> but also other ionosphere models results such as IRI. In our comparison process, we take benefit of various ionosphere data from several European stations (Chilton in UK, Dourbes in Belgium, El Arenosillo and Roquetes in Spain, Pruhonice in Czech Republic) where ionosonde and GPS TEC data are available for different solar activity levels. These data allow us to study NeQuick representation of the ionosphere at mid-latitudes. We investigate the difference between GPS-derived vTEC and corresponding values from NeQuick for the latest years (between solar maximum in 2000 and minimum in 2007) in order to observe the temporal dependencies towards Universal Time, season and solar activity. On the one hand, we use ionosonde data to constrain the model so that we can concentrate on its formulation of the profile only. We especially highlight the improvements from the latest (second) version of NeQuick and show the critical importance of the topside formulation. On the other hand, we analyse the model residual errors for the same situations computing vTEC through the Galileo algorithm...|$|R
40|$|A devastating {{earthquake}} {{of magnitude}} 6. 9 occurred in Southern Italy on 23 rd November 1980 in Irpinia-Basilicata area. Variations of different geochemical, atmospheric and ionospheric parameters and electromagnetic emissions were registered {{around the time}} of the Irpinia earthquake. The substantial progress reached in understanding the physics of the electromagnetic and thermal anomalies associated with the earthquake preparation process permitted us to create the Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere (LAI) coupling model published recently. It shows that the observed effects are not independent but present the cause-consequence chain of physical processes and plasma- chemical reactions. We try to analyze the seismic data, radon emanation, hydrological anomalies, ground based ionosondes network, NOAA/AVHRR Thermal Infrared Irradiance (TIR) anomaly, Intercosmos- 19 satellite <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> and VLF emissions data using the concept of the developed model and existing laboratory and largescale active experiments on air ionization. If the observed radon activity is really connected with the earthquake preparation process, all other variations of the atmosphere and ionosphere parameters can be explained as a consequence of the main physical process – air ionization by radon...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that satellite-borne RF sounders can act as mobile ionospheric heaters in addition to performing <b>topside</b> <b>sounding.</b> The main objective of <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> is to use sounder-generated electromagnetic (em) waves to obtain ionospheric topside vertical electron-density (N(sub e) profiles. These profiles are obtained from mathematical inversions of the frequency vs. delay-time ionospheric reflection traces. In addition to these em reflection traces, a number of narrowband intense signals are observed starting at zero delay times after the transmitted pulses. Some of these signals, termed plasma resonances, appear at characteristic frequencies of the ambient medium such as at the electron cyclotron frequency f(sub ce), the harmonics nf(sub ce), the electron plasma frequency f(sub pe) and the upper-hybrid frequency f(sub uh), where (f(sub uh)) (exp 2) = (f(sub ce)) (exp 2) + (f(sub pe)) (exp 2). These signals {{have been attributed to}} the oblique echoes of sounder-generated electrostatic (es) waves. These resonances provide accurate in situ f(sub pe) and f(sub ce) values which, in turn, lead to accurate N(sub e) and [B] values where B is the ambient magnetic field. Resonances are also observed between the nf(sub ce) harmonics both above and below f(sub uh). The former, known as the Qn plasma resonances, are mainly attributed to the matching of the wave group velocity of sounder-generated (Bernstein-mode) es waves to the satellite velocity. The frequency spectrum of these waves in the magnetosphere can be used to detect non-Maxwellian electron velocity-distributions. In addition, these resonances also exhibit components that appear {{to be the result of}} plasma emissions stimulated by the sounder pulses. The plasma resonances observed between the nf(sub ce) harmonics and below f(sub uh), known as the Dn plasma resonances, are entirely attributed to such sounder-stimulated plasma emissions. There are other sounder-stimulated plasma phenomena that also fall into this category, e. g., ion affects on electron-resonant phenomena, proton-cyclotron echoes and N(sub e) field-aligned irregularities (FAI). Some of these phenomena are more pronounced when f(sub pe) /f(sub ce) approx. = n where n is an integer significantly greater than one. The observations suggest that the sounder-stimulated plasma phenomena are stimulated, or enhanced, on a time scale much less than one second. The purpose of this presentation is to review the above topics with particular emphasis on the sounder-stimulated plasma phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The topside ionospheric {{scale height}} (TISH) and the O + -H + {{transition}} height (TH) are key ionospheric parameters which are {{of special interest}} when studying and modelling the plasma composition and dynamics. Recently, new TISH and TH empirical models have been developed. The database for these models has been built upon thousands of TISH and TH values deduced from electron profiles obtained via <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements. For validation purposes, {{it would be interesting}} to compare calculations of the ionospheric scale/transition heights as calculated by the topside-sounder TISH/TH models and other well-known models - NeQuick and Parameterized Ionospheric Model (PIM). Electron density profiles, in the altitude range 200 - 2000 km, are obtained from the NeQuick and PIM models for a grid of input parameters, such as month, local time, geomagnetic latitude, F 10. 7 solar flux. The topside scale height and O + -H + transition height values are extracted from each of these profiles in the same manner as it has been done for the TISH/TH model’s database. These values are then compared with the respective values provided by the TISH/TH model. Results and possible implementation in the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{ionosphere}} plays {{a crucial}} role in GNSS accuracy. In extreme cases, this electrically charged part of the atmosphere can lead to errors in positioning exceeding 100 m. At first approximation, the ionospheric effect depends on the frequency of the incident signal and on the total content in free electrons of the ionosphere (“total electron content”, TEC) which is the integral of the electron density on the path between the satellite and the receiver. The modelling of this parameter reveals then itself to be critical in particular for single-frequency receivers, the most common ones constituting the mass market, but also for multiple-frequency devices which will comprise a fallback mode in single frequency within the framework of critical applications such as civil aviation where the level of precision must be guaranteed in all circumstances. The NeQuick model, which has been chosen for correcting the ionospheric error contribution in GALILEO single frequency users, calculates the electron density at a given point of the ionosphere according to the time conditions and the solar activity. This electron density can be integrated along the path from the receiver to the considered satellite to provide the TEC. The NeQuick model depends on a parameter Az (“effective ionization level”) which will be daily updated by the GALILEO ground stations to give the solar activity information to the model. In order to reach the ionosphere error correction level objective (70 % or 20 TECu whichever is larger), the model itself as well as its use for GALILEO are investigated. Different situations have to be considered: different latitude regions (space conditions), different hours, seasons and years (time conditions) and specific phenomena appearance (magnetic storms, Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances – TIDs). In addition the results can be compared to different data sets among which GPS slant or vertical TEC measurements, Global Ionospheric Maps, ionosonde profiles, <b>topside</b> <b>soundings</b> but also other ionosphere models results such as IRI. As a first step in a thorough comparison process, we take benefit of various ionosphere data from the Dourbes Observatory (Belgium) where ionosonde and GPS TEC data are available on a period of more than one solar cycle, to study the mid-latitudes. We first investigate the difference between GPS-derived vTEC for Dourbes station and vTEC values from NeQuick for the latest years (between solar maximum in 2000 and minimum in 2006) in order to observe the temporal dependencies towards Universal Time, season and solar activity. The paper analyses the different situations when NeQuick fails to represent TEC in an adequate way to provide an efficient correction for navigation. Ionosonde measurements will help in the interpretation of these situations...|$|R
40|$|In a study {{designed}} to determine the temporal development of ionospheric irregularities in the auroral region in magnetic storm periods, different types of simultaneous observations were compared for the storms of January 10, April 10 - 11, and May 15, 1997. The data sets consisted of ultraviolet images (UVI) from the Polar satellite, phase fluctuations and total electron content (TEC) from Global Positioning System (GPS) recordings at {{a large number of}} sites, magnetometer observations and hemispheric power precipitation. The large-scale global or macroscale picture of the magnetic storm showed the importance of universal time in the development of irregularities. The hemispheric total power picture and the global indices such as Kp show this macroscale picture of the entire storm period. However, individual sites show differences in localized magnetic field variations and the development of irregularities; this we term the microscale. The storms of January 10 and May 15 show the importance of local magnetic time and local magnetic variations at the sites, while the storm of April 10 - 11 was dominated by the UT storm development. During the intense activity of the storms, total electron content shows minute-by-minute increases with the satellite moving to positions 6 km apart in the minute. The structured precipitation either directly produces irregularities or indirectly sets instability conditions for irregularity development in the auroral region. Good correlation was established for the three storms between UVI intensity and phase fluctuation development. The UVI Lyman-Birge-Hopfield-long (170 nm) emission is sensitive to 100 - 200 km precipitation. Phase fluctuation development undoubtedly arises from perturbations in the F region as well. <b>Topside</b> and bottomside <b>soundings</b> have shown the high occurrence of spread-F in the auroral region. The comparison of the data sets from these storms and from other studies indicates that the creation of irregularities develops from conditions existing over a large range of bottomside heights, i. e., at altitudes from 100 km to the F layer.

40|$|The Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) on the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) mission {{operates}} like a radar by transmitting {{and receiving}} coherent electromagnetic pulses. Long-range echoes of electromagnetic sounder waves are reflected at remote plasma cutoffs. Thus, analyses of RPI observations will yield the plasma parameters and distances to the remote reflection points. These analyses {{assume that the}} reflecting plasma surfaces are cold and are sufficiently smooth that they effectively behave as plane mirrors to the incoming sounder waves, i. e., that geometric optics can be used. The RPI will employ pulse compression and spectral integration techniques, perfected in ground-based ionospheric digital sounders, {{in order to enhance}} the signal-to-noise ratio in long-range magnetospheric sounding. When plasma irregularities exist in the remote magnetospheric plasmas that are being probed by the sounder waves, echo signatures may become complicated. Ionospheric sounding experience indicates that while <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> echo strengths can actually be enhanced by the presence of irregularities, ground-based sounding indicates that coherent detection techniques can still be employed. In this paper we investigate the plasma conditions that will allow coherent signals to be detected by the RPI and the signatures to be expected, such as scattering and plasma resonances, in the presence of multi-scale irregularities, may possibly have on RPI signals.

40|$|Electron density {{irregularities}} in the ionosphere {{are known to}} be magnetically anisotropic, preferentially elongated along the lines of force. While many studies of their morphology have been undertaken by <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> and whistler measurements, it is only recently that detailed regional-scale reconstructions have become possible, enabled by the advent of widefield radio telescopes. Here we present a new approach for visualising and studying field-aligned irregularities (FAIs), which involves transforming interferometric measurements of TEC gradients onto a magnetic shell tangent plane. This removes the perspective distortion associated with the oblique viewing angle of the irregularities from the ground, facilitating the decomposition of dynamics along and across magnetic field lines. We apply this transformation to the dataset of Loi et al. [2015 a], obtained on 15 October 2013 by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope and displaying prominent FAIs. We study these FAIs in the new reference frame, quantifying field-aligned and field-transverse behaviour, examining time and altitude dependencies, and extending the analysis to FAIs on sub-array scales. We show that the inclination of the plane can be derived solely from the data, and verify that the best-fit value is consistent with the known magnetic inclination. The ability of the model to concentrate the fluctuations along a single spatial direction may find practical application to future calibration strategies for widefield interferometry, by providing a compact representation of FAI-induced distortions.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of a substantial ionospheric response to a strong interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) detected by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on board the Mars Express (MEX) spacecraft. A powerful ICME impacted the Martian ionosphere beginning on 5 June 2011, peaking on 6 June, and trailing off over about a week. This event caused a strong response in the charged particle detector of the High-Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) on board the Odyssey spacecraft. The ion mass spectrometer of the Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms instrument on MEX detected an increase in background counts, simultaneous with the increase seen by HEND, due to the flux of solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with the ICME. Local densities and magnetic field strengths measured by MARSIS and enhancements of 100 eV electrons denote the passing of an intense space weather event. Local density and magnetosheath electron measurements and remote soundings show compression of ionospheric plasma to lower altitudes due to increased solar wind dynamic pressure. MARSIS <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> of the ionosphere indicates that it is extended well beyond the terminator, to about 116 ° solar zenith angle, in a highly disturbed state.

40|$|The {{enhanced}} Polar Outflow Probe (ePOP) {{is scheduled}} to be launched as part of the Cascade Demonstrator Small-Sat and Ionospheric Polar Explorer (CASSIOPE) satellite in early 2008. A Radio Receiver Instrument (RRI) on ePOP will receive HF transmissions from various ground-based transmitters. In preparation for the ePOP mission, data from a similar transionospheric experiment performed by the International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies (ISIS) II satellite has been studied. Prominent features in the received 9. 303 -MHz signal were periodic Faraday fading of signal intensity at rates up to 13 Hz and a time of arrival delay between the O- and X-modes of up to 0. 8 ms. Both features occurred when the satellite was above or south of the Ottawa transmitter. Ionospheric models for ray tracing were constructed using both International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) profiles and local peak electron density values from ISIS ionograms. Values for fade rate and differential mode delay were computed and compared to the values observed in the ISIS II data. The computed values showed very good agreement to the observed values of both received signal parameters when the <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> foF 2 values were used to scale IRI profiles, but not when strictly modelled IRI profiles were used. It was determined that the primary modifier of the received signal parameters was the foF 2 density and not the shape of the profile. This dependence was due to refraction, at the 9. 303 -MHz signal frequency, causing the rays to travel larger distances near the peak density where essentially all the mode splitting occurred.

The maps show that averaged fo F 2, hm F 2, and fp longitudinal variations are rather complicated, their structure looks wave-like with quasi-periods in longitude of about 75 ? 100 °, similar to that on individual days revealed previously at low latitudes using Intercosmos- 19 data.

Along with general resemblance, essential distinctions between them were found. Intercosmos- 19 maps show more complicated and pronounced longitudinal structure than IRI maps. They also show that at solar maximum, in general, at night, EA is stronger and persists for a longer time (on average, until 04 : 00 LT) than that presented in IRI model.

Data of total electron content (TEC) and global electron content (GEC) produced from global ionospheric maps, GIM-TEC for 1999 - 2013, the ionospheric electron content (IEC) measured by TOPEX-Jason 1 and 2 satellites for 2001 - 2012, the F- 2 layer critical frequency and peak height measured on board ISIS 1, ISIS 2, and IK 19 satellites during 1969 - 1982, and the earthquakes M 5 + occurrences for 1999 - 2013 are analyzed. Annual asymmetry is observed with GEC and IEC for the years of observation with asymmetry index, AI, showing January > July excess from 0. 02 to 0. 25. The coincident pattern of January-to-July asymmetry ratio of TEC and IEC colocated along the magnetic longitude sector of 270 degrees +/- 5 degrees E in the Pacific Ocean is obtained varying with local time and magnetic latitude. The sea/land differences in the F- 2 layer peak electron density, NmF 2, and the peak height, h(m) F(2), gathered with <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> data exhibit tilted ionosphere along the seashores with denser electron population at greater peak heights over the sea. The topside peak electron density NmF 2, TEC, IEC, and the hemisphere part of GEC are dominant in the South hemisphere which resembles the pattern for seismic activity with dominant earthquake occurrence in the South magnetic hemisphere.

40|$|We used bottomside ground {{observations}} and <b>topside</b> <b>sounding</b> {{data from the}} Intercosmos- 19 satellite to study a Travelling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID) that occurred in response to Large-Scale Internal Gravity Wave (LSIGW) propagation during a substorm on November 30, 1979. We built a global scheme for the wavelike ionospheric variations during this medium substorm (AEmax 800 nT). The area where the TID was observed looks like a wedge since it covers the nighttime hours at subauroral latitudes but contracts to a 02 h local sector at low latitudes. The ionospheric response is strongly asymmetric because the wedge area and the TID amplitude are larger in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere. Clear evidence was obtained indicating that the more powerful TID from the Northern (winter) hemisphere propagated across the equator into the low latitude Southern (summer) hemisphere. Intercosmos- 19 observations show that the disturbance covers the entire thickness of the topside ionosphere, from hmF 2 up to at least the 1000 km satellite altitude at post-midnight local times. F-layer lifting reached 200 km, Ne increases in the topside ionosphere by up to a factor of 1. 9 and variations in NmF 2 of both signs were observed. Assumptions are made concerning {{the reason for the}} IGW effect at high altitudes in the topside ionosphere. The relationship between TID parameters and source characteristics determined from a global network of magnetometers are studied. The role of the dayside cusp in the generation of the TID in the daytime ionosphere is discussed. The magnetospheric electric field effects are distinguished from IGW effects. Research Highlights The global scheme for the large-scale TID propagation during a substorm is built. TID covers the entire thickness of the topside ionosphere. The area where the TID is observed looks like a wedge directed to the equator. TID area and amplitude are larger in the winter hemisphere than in the summer hemisphere. The more powerful TID from the winter hemisphere propagates into the summer hemisphere.
