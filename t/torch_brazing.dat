50|$|<b>Torch</b> <b>brazing</b> {{is by far}} {{the most}} common method of {{mechanized}} brazing in use. It is best used in small production volumes or in specialized operations, and in some countries, it accounts for a majority of the brazing taking place. There are three main categories of <b>torch</b> <b>brazing</b> in use: manual, machine, and automatic <b>torch</b> <b>brazing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Automatic <b>torch</b> <b>brazing</b> is {{a method}} that almost {{eliminates}} the need for manual labor in the brazing operation, except for loading and unloading of the machine. The main advantages of this method are: a high production rate, uniform braze quality, and reduced operating cost. The equipment used is essentially the same as that used for Machine <b>torch</b> <b>brazing,</b> with the main difference being that the machinery replaces the operator in the part preparation.|$|E
50|$|Manual <b>torch</b> <b>brazing</b> is a {{procedure}} where {{the heat is}} applied using a gas flame placed {{on or near the}} joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely manual or has some level of automation. Manual brazing is most commonly used on small production volumes or in applications where the part size or configuration makes other brazing methods impossible. The main drawback is the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill required to obtain quality brazed joints. The use of flux or self-fluxing material is required to prevent oxidation. <b>Torch</b> <b>brazing</b> of copper can be done without the use of flux if it is brazed with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.|$|E
50|$|Machine <b>torch</b> <b>brazing</b> is {{commonly}} used where a repetitive braze operation is being carried out. This method {{is a mix of}} both automated and manual operations with an operator often placing brazes material, flux and jigging parts while the machine mechanism carries out the actual braze. The advantage of this method is that it reduces the high labor and skill requirement of manual brazing. The use of flux is also required for this method as there is no protective atmosphere, and it is best suited to small to medium production volumes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Brazing {{generally}} require cumbersome apparatus be it induction, vacuum or <b>torch</b> <b>brazing.</b> In <b>torch</b> <b>brazing,</b> metals {{are joined}} by using the oxyacetylene cylinder. It thus becomes difficult to carry out brazing at the places where {{it is not possible}} to take heavy gas cylinders and brazing apparatuses. So it is tried to figure out the method to carry out brazing at places where conventional brazing is not feasible. And thus Brazing was done by usual Shielded Metal Arc Welding, by developing the electrode composition for the joining process of three different kinds of metals and alloys, without using the oxyacetylene cylinder and other heavy brazing apparatus. The results show that this newly developed brazing method gave almost same appropriate welding results as it is given by the conventional brazing method.

40|$|Objective was {{to assess}} {{techniques}} for joining NZP ceramics, a new family of ceramic materials that have low coefficient of thermal expansion, low thermal conductivity, and excellent thermal-shock resistance. Initially, the authors evaluated laser-beam welding over volatile fluxing agents (ferric oxide, copper oxide, boric acid, and boron nitride). They also examined other laser, arc-welding, brazing, and cold joining techniques. The NZP materials were capable of sustaining the thermal stresses associated with these joining processes without substantial cracking. Of the volatile fluxes, only the copper oxide promoted weld fusion. Efforts to accomplish fusion by laser-beam welding over copper, titanium, stainless steel, yttrium barium copper oxide, fused silica glass, and mullite/alumina were unsuccessful. Gas-tungsten arc welding accompanied by porosity, irregularities, and cracking was achieved on copper sheet sandwiched between NZP tiles. Attempts at conventional oxy-acetylene welding and <b>torch</b> <b>brazing</b> were unproductive. Silica-based oxide mixtures and copper oxide-based materials show potential for development into filler materials for furnace brazing, and phosphate-based cements show promise {{as a means of}} cold joining...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} to develop the process of <b>torch</b> <b>brazing</b> system which transmits the {{pressure}} on the workpiece to be brazed. Mechanical stress is given by 0, 0. 7, 1. 2 and 1. 7 MPa. When the filler melts, it cause mechanical pressure to push each sample and cause a reduction in the thickness of the filler. The higher the static pressure is given, the smaller thickness of the filler. Therefore, when the sample is heated, stainless steel expands and resulting thermal stresses. The thinner the thickness of the filler due to mechanical pressure will result in the interaction distance is getting smaller. And with the same thickness of the filler, it will result in greater thermal stress with the increasing mechanical pressure. So the displacement will increase along with the amount of mechanical stress given. By giving stress on the joining process it will affect the joint brazed connections clearance. With the change in the joint clearance will certainly affect the strength of the connection as well. The study was conducted to investigate the effect of {{the pressure on the}} strength of joint...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{different}} plasma arc welding parameters on the flexural strength of titanium alloy beams (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V). Forty Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and 10 NiCr alloy beam specimens (40 mm long and 3. 18 mm diameter) were prepared and divided into 5 groups (n= 10). The titanium alloy beams for the control group were not sectioned or subjected to welding. Groups PL 10, PL 12, and PL 14 contained titanium beams sectioned and welded at current 3 A for 10, 12 or 14 ms, respectively. Group NCB consisted of NiCr alloy beams welded using conventional <b>torch</b> <b>brazing.</b> After, the beams were subjected to a three-point bending test and the values obtained were analyzed to assess the flexural strength (MPa). Statistical analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test at 0. 05 confidence level. Significant difference was verified among the evaluated groups (p 0. 05). The NCB group showed the lowest flexural strength, although it was statistically similar to the PL 14 group (p> 0. 05). The weld depth penetration was not significantly different among the plasma welded groups (p= 0. 05). Three representative specimens were randomly selected to be evaluated under scanning electron microcopy. The composition of the welded regions was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This study provides an initial set of parameters supporting the use of plasma welding during fabrication of titanium alloy dental frameworks...|$|E
