5|$|The 1967 war {{severely}} depleted Egypt's military strength, {{as most of}} <b>their</b> <b>air</b> {{force and}} a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt's inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt's interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to rebuild <b>their</b> <b>air</b> defenses. The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is a tandem two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, {{long-range}} supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber {{originally developed}} for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly adaptable, it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become {{a major part of}} <b>their</b> <b>air</b> wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversion}} of {{three quarters of}} the Axis troops and the majority of <b>their</b> <b>air</b> forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy. In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany The British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran's oil fields.

5|$|The {{essential}} {{target was}} RAF Fighter Command. The service's destruction would deny the British <b>their</b> <b>air</b> superiority asset. Throughout July and early August, the Germans made preparations for Adlertag. The {{date of the}} assault was postponed several times because of bad weather. Eventually, it was carried out on 13 August 1940. The German attacks on 13 August inflicted significant damage and casualties on the ground, but, marred by poor intelligence and communication, they {{did not make a}} significant impression on Fighter Command's ability to defend British air space.|$|E
5|$|The ship figured {{prominently}} {{in the development of}} the IJN's carrier striking force doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to <b>their</b> <b>air</b> power. A revolutionary strategic concept at the time, the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn <b>their</b> <b>air</b> power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E

5|$|As Saomai {{approached}} South Korea, the typhoon {{forced the}} cancellation of flights beginning on September12. Four airports had <b>their</b> <b>air</b> service suspended. Other suspensions of transportation included the refuge of 362fishing boats in ports and the closure of 10national parks and 43mountain paths. As a result, about 16,600campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas. As {{a result of the}} inclement weather, the operation of 149passenger ships were cancelled. On September13, the Korea Meteorological Administration(KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province. The administration anticipated heavy rainfall, though not as much as what had taken place in Japan. Offshore, an Indonesian freighter with 39crewmen became stranded by the typhoon in waters south of Pusan. The crew were rescued by maritime police, but 270tons of oil spilled into the ocean from a broken oil container.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam. U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with {{a rationale for}} a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia. Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when <b>their</b> <b>air</b> defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet <b>their</b> <b>air</b> transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could not be held without the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of <b>their</b> <b>air</b> cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|The II./Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77; II Group Fighter Wing 77)—under {{the command}} of Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher—took off from Nordholz Airbase and intercepted No. 9 Squadron. Feldwebels Hans Troitzsch and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another. These {{aircraft}} from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to have been shot down by enemy fighters {{during the war and}} Troitzsch was most likely to have been the first enemy pilot to shoot one down. Another four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery fire. The Germans believed <b>their</b> <b>air</b> defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack. Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands and Belgium {{wished to}} remain neutral {{and refused to}} allow the RAF to {{establish}} bases, to fly deeper into Germany. They also forbade overflying by British bombers to and from Germany. After the outbreak of war, the French refused to allow RAF bombers to bomb German cities from French airfields. The French felt secure behind the Maginot Line, but <b>their</b> <b>air</b> force did not possess the modern bombers to deliver a pre-emptive strike against the Luftwaffe. French fighter forces were not yet ready for an all out defensive campaign against the Germans either. A fear of retaliation was the main French reason. The only recourse was to fly missions directly from Britain and only ports or coastal cities in northern Germany were within easy reach. This state of affairs suited the British, in particular, the Admiralty.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) {{consisted}} of only 132 aircraft and 2,000 personnel, of whom only 80 were pilots and most poorly trained. The two Koreas had very small air forces of their own, with the North Koreans' 132 aircraft organized into the KPAF 1st Air Division. At the early {{phase in the}} war, these aircraft were used boldly to the North Koreans' advantage. Aware of <b>their</b> <b>air</b> superiority over the Republic of Korea Air Force and not expecting UN intervention, they anticipated light resistance in the air. In all, the KPAF had 2,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The Power Pilot Scholarship (PPS) {{program is}} a seven-week course that allows cadets to get their private pilot licence and <b>their</b> <b>Air</b> Cadet Power Pilot Wings. A goal for many cadets within the program is to secure a private pilot licence prior {{to the age of}} 19. Cadets who are aged 17–18 apply and are {{selected}} to write an exam and interview for the prestigious scholarship. The course provides cadets with both ground school training and in-flight instruction at the various flight centres across Canada. Cadets who have been successful within the program have integrated themselves with commercial airlines, the Canadian Forces, various courier and charter companies, and have also gone on to become instructors at various flight schools. Overall, this opportunity to attain a private pilots’ licence remains {{as one of the most}} prestigious and attractive opportunities available within the Air Cadet program.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also {{considered}} {{a sign of}} the arrival of the Jet age, the Il-10, which had been considered a high quality and effective conventional aircraft in World War II had been easily outmatched by the F-80 and its jet engine. The engagement was a rare example of an air-to-air battle at the early phase of the war, and North Korean forces became much more cautious when deploying their aircraft in battle, knowing they were easily outnumbered and outmatched by UN forces. For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating <b>their</b> <b>air</b> forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. The public perception of the F-80s, which had to this point been cautious, improved with news of the victories.|$|E
