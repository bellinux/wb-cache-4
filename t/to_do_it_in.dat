5|$|Takumi {{learns that}} he is an artificial, {{delusional}} clone with fabricated memories, created by Shogun – the real Takumi. His sister Nanami is being held in the location of the real Noah II, where she is made to awaken as a gigalomaniac and obtain a Di-Sword. Rimi – also a gigalomaniac – tries to save her, but is attacked by Norose and is taken prisoner in Nanami's stead. Shogun again meets with Takumi to tell him that he had intended to stop Nozomi from taking over humanity with Noah II, but that his body – aged from disease and overuse of gigalomaniac powers – hindered him, prompting him to create Takumi <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his stead. Takumi obtains a Di-Sword, and destroys the transmitters, revealing the nurse Hazuki to be the New Gen killer in the process by reading her memories and projecting them onto the screens on the buildings. An earthquake occurs, destroying much of Shibuya; Takumi rescues the other gigalomaniacs from the destruction, and continues to the location of Noah II. He fights Norose, but Noah II activates its self-defense mode, overwhelming Takumi with delusions; he reaffirms his existence, and destroys Norose and Noah II with his Di-Sword. As he lies in the ruins of Shibuya, depending on what delusions the player has chosen, he either gives up his life along with the dying Shogun's, or stays alive with Rimi.|$|E

25|$|In {{his next}} start, Dickey pitched a {{complete}} game one-hit shutout against the Orioles, {{becoming the first}} pitcher since Dave Stieb in 1988 to throw two consecutive one-hitters.

25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year.

Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: They had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from Los Angeles to New York City.|$|E

25|$|While Lévy {{defines the}} notion of optimal sharing, he does not provide an {{algorithm}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> Vincent van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood's paper , they provide such an algorithm by transforming lambda terms into interaction nets, which are then reduced. Roughly speaking, the resulting reduction is optimal because every term that {{would have the same}} labels as per Lévy's paper would also be the same graph in the interaction net. In the paper, they mention that their prototype implementation of Lambdascope performs as well as the optimised version of the reference optimal higher order machine BOHM.|$|E

25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

He scored the fifth consecutive century on 26 May against Essex at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. becoming only the eighth player to achieve this feat.

Sangakkara became the first batsman to reach 1,000 runs for the season when he brought up his sixth century for the season against Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} NFL season in 1998, Warner played only one game and threw just 11 passes.

Warner was not the only Rams player compiling significant statistics, though. Running back Marshall Faulk, in his first year in St. Louis after spending five seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. He scored 12 touchdowns, rushed for 1,381 yards, and recorded a team-leading 87 receptions for 1,048 yards. In all, Faulk gained a record 2,429 total yards and became just the second running back in NFL history to gain over 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season (Roger Craig was the first <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> 1985). Faulk held the NFL record for yards from scrimmage in a single season until Tennessee's Chris Johnson broke it in 2009.|$|E
