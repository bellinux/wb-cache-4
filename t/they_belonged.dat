5|$|At {{the request}} of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King {{declared}} Holloway legally dead in absentia on January 12, 2012. On August 16, 2017, Holloway's father announced that he and a private investigator had recently discovered human remains {{and that they were}} being DNA-tested to determine whether <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to his daughter. Final results revealed that the human remains did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|Brown had {{collected}} seventy-seven osteoderms while excavating a Tyrannosaurus specimen in the Lance Formation of Wyoming in 1900. He mentioned these osteoderms (specimen AMNH 5866) in {{his description of}} Ankylosaurus, but thought <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to the Tyrannosaurus instead. Paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn also expressed this view when he described the Tyrannosaurus specimen as the now invalid genus Dynamosaurus in 1905. Later examination has shown them {{to be similar to}} those of Ankylosaurus, and that Brown had compared them with some Euoplocephalus osteoderms, which had been erroneously catalogued as belonging to Ankylosaurus at the AMNH.|$|E
5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex.

Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E

A judge in Sanford, Florida, temporarily banned Jack from distributing photographs of Runnels ahead of a hearing.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of emu {{that was}} endemic to King Island, which {{is situated in}} the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago, when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may {{be an example of}} insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five {{bodies were found}} to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to any of the murdered women.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E

5|$|Parkinson {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most eminent gardeners of his day. He {{maintained}} close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen such as William Coys, John Gerard, John Tradescant the elder (who was a close friend), Vespasian Robin, and the Frenchman Matthias de Lobel (also known as Matthias de L'Obel or Matthaeus Lobelius). Together, <b>they</b> <b>belonged</b> to the generation that began to see extraordinary new plants coming from the Levant and from Virginia, broadly speaking. In his writings, de Lobel frequently mentioned the Long Acre garden and praised Parkinson's abilities. Parkinson, on his part, edited and presented in Theatrum Botanicum the papers of de Lobel, who had spent the final years of his life in Highgate supervising the gardens of Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche.|$|E
5|$|Royal bodyguards {{served as}} the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the agema of the hypaspistai, a type of ancient special forces usually {{numbering}} in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which <b>they</b> <b>belonged.</b> Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king's inner circle, were not always responsible for protecting the king's life {{on and off the}} battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.|$|E
5|$|The Jägerstab was {{instrumental}} in bringing about the increased exploitation of slave labour {{for the benefit of}} Germany's war industry and its air force, the Luftwaffe. The task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use of slave labour in the aviation manufacturing. Records show that SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects at the peak of Jägerstab's construction activities. Taking into account the high mortality rate associated with the underground construction projects, the historian Marc Buggeln estimates that the workforce involved amounted to 80,000−90,000 inmates. <b>They</b> <b>belonged</b> to the various sub-camps of Mittelbau-Dora, Mauthausen-Gusen, Buchenwald and other camps. The prisoners worked for Junkers, Messerschmitt, Henschel and BMW, among others.|$|E
