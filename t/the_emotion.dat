5000|$|The Mattel line of {{toys and}} dolls was quite large. There were three large dolls, five medium dolls (Emotions) 12 small dolls, nine animals, 50 sprites (including those {{that came with}} the small dolls), four large boxed toys, ten boxed wallhangings and doll carriers, and 27 small carded toys for a total of 111 {{different}} items and this does not include generational (some dolls were sold in two different boxes over time in some markets) and international packaging variations. These toys were expensive for their time and Mattel responded by producing a lower priced line of toys sold loose with tags called the 'Emotions' line. <b>The</b> <b>Emotions</b> line included five dolls including a 15" [...] Buddy Blue doll, that was sold only in Canada. The extra sprite in the line happened to be Champ. Also included were five Sprites, Starlite the horse and Lurky. Oddly enough, <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> dolls were larger than the small dolls in the regular line, but <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> horse was smaller than the normal version. As such <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> dolls were neither in scale with <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> horse or <b>the</b> regular Mattel version. And of course <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> dolls were too big to sit on <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> horse or <b>the</b> normal one. Not all toys were sold in all markets, and <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> line was never sold outside the United States and Canada.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a way of}} conceptualising how <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> can affect <b>the</b> language {{of teaching and learning}} of the classroom. Vygotsky’s concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, it is shown, can be expanded to incorporate emotional factors alongside cognitive and cultural factors. In explaining how this can be done, the interdependence of cognition and <b>emotion</b> in <b>the</b> language of teaching and learning is demonstrated. With the use of an example from a primary maths lesson, the emotional dimension of scaffolding is explored. Incorporating <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> into Vygotskian theory This paper sets out a sociocultural approach to <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> in learning. It argues that Vygotsky’s (1988) zone of proximal development (ZPD) can be developed as a conceptual framework to allow us to understand the role of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> in development and learning.

5000|$|Meta-emotion is [...] "an {{organized}} and structured set of emotions and cognitions about <b>the</b> <b>emotions,</b> both one's own <b>emotions</b> and <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> of others".

40|$|Interest in the {{political}} relevance of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> is growing rapidly. In light of this, Hannah Arendt’s claim that <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> are apolitical has come under renewed fire. But many critics have misunderstood her views {{on the relationship between}} individuals, <b>emotions</b> and <b>the</b> political. This paper addresses this issue by reconstructing the conceptual framework through which Arendt understands <b>the</b> <b>emotions.</b> Arendt often describes the heart – where <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> reside – as a place of darkness. I begin by tracing this metaphor through her work to demonstrate that it is meant to convey the inherently uncertain nature of emotions rather than a devaluation of them. I proceed to challenge the notion that Arendt adopts the Enlightenment dichotomy between reason and emotion. In fact, she rejects both as a basis for politics. However, she does identify some constructive roles for <b>the</b> <b>emotions.</b> I argue that fear is intrinsically connected to courage – the principal political virtue – in Arendt’s philosophy. In light of my discussion, I then reinterpret the role of compassion and pity in On Revolution, concluding that Arendt’s insights can help us avoid the potential pitfalls of the contemporary project to recuperate <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> in politics...|$|R

5|$|While later {{reviews of}} the album saw It Was Written in a {{different}} light than previous reviews had, the subject matter was still seen as a major flaw of the album.

While Illmatic is often held as Nas's magnum opus, It Was Written was not only perceived by critics as part of a sophomore jinx, but was also the first of Nas's subsequent work to be heavily judged and compared to the former. However, It Was Written has been noted as his commercial breakthrough by critics, as it boosted the rapper's image in the mainstream and helped attract a much larger fan-base.|$|E

40|$|This article {{shows the}} main {{results of an}} {{empirical}} research about <b>the</b> relation between <b>emotions</b> and urban lighting scenarios. The focus is on <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> experienced by participants in outdoor public spaces, such as pedestrian areas, parks, and other spaces. To understand subjects’ emotions, we followed a procedure of surveys using situation–response questionnaires in a closed, controlled environment with participants (N = 217) belonging to three universities of different countries: the University of Guadalajara in Guadalajara, Mexico; Polytechnic University of Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain; and Via Domitian University in Perpignan, France. The set of 10 frequent emotions related to urban lighting mentioned by Calvillo Cortés {{was used for the}} study. Cross-cultural comparison of answers about <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> felt by participants allowed us to classify <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> in two types: <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> commonly perceived among the three groups and <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> particularly perceived by each group attributable to their cultural background. Based on that, we present conclusions about the relation between <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> and <b>the</b> lighting parameters of the scene. In addition, we present a theoretical exploration of other researches related to subjective approaches on lighting, pointing out that emotions are not as widely studied as other psychological responses to lit places. This requires further conceptualization of the theoretical framework to increase the focus on <b>the</b> importance of <b>emotions</b> in <b>the</b> design of urban lighting spaces, providing more pleasant and healthy user experience...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>emotions</b> are at <b>the</b> {{centre of}} our lives and, for better or worse, imbue them with much of their significance. The {{philosophical}} problems stirred up by the existence of <b>the</b> <b>emotions,</b> over which many great philosophers of the past have laboured, revolve around attempts to understand what this significance amounts to. Are emotions feelings, thoughts, or experiences? If they are experiences, what are they experiences of? Are emotions rational? In what sense do emotions give meaning to what surrounds us? The Emotions: A Philosophical Introduction introduces and explores these questions in a clear and accessible way.

40|$|This study {{examined}} developmental changes in children's {{ability to understand}} <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> expressed in other children's drawings. Eighty participants, at each of four age groups - three, four, five and six years - were presented {{with a series of}} child drawings, each expressing a different emotion (happiness, sadness, anger or fear). All drawings had been previously rated by adult judges on an emotion-intensity scale as being good exemplars of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> examined. Next, participants were shown pictures of child artists each expressing one of <b>the</b> designated <b>emotions</b> on her/his face and were instructed to identify the artist who created each drawing. The results showed that: (i) by age three, children demonstrated an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> expressed in drawings; (ii) happiness, sadness and fear were <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> most easily recognized by participants. Overall, these results provide support for the assertion that the ability to understand the emotional meaning of drawings is present from the preschool years.
