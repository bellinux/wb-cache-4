5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} in 1899 and opened to passengers on 20 July 1903, following its electrification in 1902. After the railway grouping of 1923, passenger numbers declined so significantly that the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and that service was withdrawn. The railway closed <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> in 1959, following the hospital's decision to convert its coal boilers to oil, which rendered the railway unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{airport site}} to Gardermoen was proposed at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport express train, but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all trains on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional and express trains which continue via the Dovre Line. Local trains on the Hoved Line and Kongsvinger Line to the north also use the tunnel. Use of the Hoved Line is limited <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> trains and commuter trains which make stops along the route.|$|E
5|$|Rail {{connectivity}} in Mangalore {{was established}} in 1907. Mangalore was also {{the starting point of}} India's longest rail route. The city has two railway stations—Mangalore Central (at Hampankatta) and Mangalore Junction (at Kankanadi). A railway track, built through the Western Ghats, connects Mangalore with Hassan. The broad gauge track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan was opened <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> traffic in May 2006 and passenger traffic in December 2007. Mangalore is also connected to Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kollam through the Southern Railway and to Mumbai, Bhatkal, Karwar, Gujarat, Ajmer and Goa via the Konkan Railway.|$|E
5|$|The City of Norman was {{formally}} incorporated on , 1891. The city {{has continued to}} grow throughout the decades. By 1902 the downtown district contained two banks, two hotels, a flour mill, and other businesses; by 1913 there were over 3,700 residents living in Norman when the Oklahoma Railway Company decided to extend its interurban streetcar running from Oklahoma City to Moore into Norman, spurring additional population growth. The rail lines eventually transitioned <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> during the 1940s as the United States Numbered Highway system developed. The city population reached 11,429 in 1940.|$|E

5|$|The station's opening {{effectively}} {{filled a}} gap in provision, as lines in the area had already been constructed; the Whiteinch and Stobcross Railways both opened in 1874, but no station was constructed on these lines at Jordanhill. A new link allowed services to Whiteinch Victoria Park to begin in 1897, but they ceased in 1951 and the link was closed <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> in 1967. The route of the link has {{been converted into a}} nature walk from Victoria Park to Jordanhill station, running alongside the existing line for approximately half its length.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The VOR/DME {{system was}} {{tested by the}} Civil Aviation Administration on 7 May and found to be working correctly. AIBN {{established}} a base of operations at the hangar at Brønnøysund Airport and used a helicopter <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> {{the pieces of the}} wreck there and bodies to Trondheim University Hospital for identification. Technical investigations started on 9 May. The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. Both were found intact and were decoded at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom. Improper use of the microphone made it difficult to hear the captain's voice, but it was possible to reconstruct the conversations and line of events. A memorial service was held on 10 May and was attended by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. The last Home Guard personnel concluded their work on 11 May and the police concluded their investigations at Torghatten on 13 May.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} stations at Daubhill and Chequerbent {{closed on}} 2 February 1885, both due to replacements opening {{on the new}} alignment. Up until 1939 the passenger service was regular and between Atherton and Bolton trains ran more or less half-hourly. As with other lines, wartime economies reduced services to a minimum. The war over, services {{did not return to}} their pre-war levels (see 1947 LMS Timetable and 1951 Bradshaw Guide) there were just six trains daily in each direction. The station at Chequerbent and that at Rumworth & Daubhill closed to passengers on 3 March 1952. All other stations between Bolton Great Moor Street and Pennington inclusive closed to passengers on 29 March 1954, with Atherleigh, West Leigh and Pennington closing completely on this date. Some rugby and holiday special trains served Great Moor street until 1958. Atherton Bag Lane closed <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> on 7 October 1963, Chequerbent closed <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> on 27 February 1965 and Rumworth & Daubhill closed <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> on 29 March 1965. The date of closure of Bolton Great Moor Street station <b>to</b> <b>freight</b> is not recorded, but the last of the rails on the line were lifted in 1969. Kenyon Junction closed to passengers in 1960 and to all traffic on 1 August 1963, although the main line is still open to traffic.|$|E
