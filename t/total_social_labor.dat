40|$|At present, total rural {{labor force}} is about 450 million in China, {{accounting}} for about 74 % of the <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> force. According to incomplete statistics, the current working time of each rural labor force less than 100 days each year, of which about 40 % {{is in the}} hidden unemployment. A large number of rural surplus labors seriously affected the growth of agricultural productivity and farmers ’ income, impeded the coordinated development of economy and society in urban and rural areas. Therefore, under the new situation how to effectively estimate {{hundreds of millions of}} rural surplus labor is of great practical significance. In the paper, we assume that if the marginal revenue is different in various industries or trades, farmers seeking profit maximization will reach the better situation. We can estimate and predict the surplus rate of rural labor force, regarding the average wage of urban employment workers and agriculture (forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries) workers as the marginal revenue of urban labor force and rural labor force, based on fitting curve of exponential function by SPSS statistical software...|$|E

In addition, we examined the underlying process of this effect by focusing on team identification as mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and <b>social</b> <b>laboring.</b> Participants were 55 male cyclists at the highest competitive level of professional cycling.

40|$|The {{demand of}} the {{national}} economy for various kinds of output can be satisfied by developing the corresponding branches of production in many regions. This {{is one of the}} main advantages of our country with its huge territory and natural resources. But since the regions of the USSR differ in their natural and economic conditions, the outlays for production of output are unequal in different regions. Therefore, it becomes an extremely pressing problem to choose that distribution of production which would enable the necessary output to be obtained with the lowest <b>total</b> expenditures of <b>social</b> <b>labor.</b> These problems are no less important than the choice of a variant of a technical solution at planned or designed enterprises. We may choose the optimal technical solution and introduce the most modern equipment or technology, which fully answer to the criteria of economic efficiency; but if the enterprise is located without regard for the natural and economic conditions of the region, its construction will be inefficient. Therefore the choice of one or another technical solution should not be put ahead of the choice of the region of construction. Along with improving methods of determining the efficiency of capital investments and new equipment, one must also work out related methods of calculating the economic efficiency of the territorial distribution of production. At the same time, one must not forget that these methods have their own special features in comparison with the methods of determining the economic efficiency of new equipment. Ignoring them will lead to great losses, considering that it is practically impossible to correct mistakes and miscalculations in territorial distribution. ...|$|R
40|$|Commodity {{production}} has greatly developed under socialism. Is this not in contradiction with the Marxist treatment of commodity production {{as a historical}} category ? Some writers think that commodity production is necessary because {{of the existence of}} the collective farms (as a form of relation {{between the state and the}} farms); but this is not true: 1) commodity relations exist between state concerns; 2) there is no absolute necessity of money relations between the state and the collective farms. Other writers believe that the commodity character of socialist production is required by the law of distribution according to labor. This is also wrong. Commodity production makes it possible to express various kinds of concrete labor, qualitatively different, in terms of abstract <b>social</b> <b>labor.</b> The impossibility of recording qualitatively different kinds of <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> in natural measure â working time â is the result not of these differences, but of the character of <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> itself in the first phase of communism. ...|$|R

40|$|This essay builds out an {{argument}} for understanding the past five centuries as the Cap-italocene, the “age of capital. ” The present essay – the second of two parts – reconstructs the limits, opportunities, and crises of the capitalist world-ecology since the long 16 th centu-ry. This reconstruction is pursued through the world-ecological reading of value-relations introduced in Part I. While Marxist political economy has taken value to be an eco-nomic phenomenon with systemic implications, I suggest value-relations as a systemic phenomenon with a pivotal economic moment. The accumulation of abstract <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> is possible only {{to the degree that}} unpaid work (human and extra-human) can be appropri-ated. The value-form (the commodity) and its substance (abstract <b>social</b> <b>labor)</b> depend upon value-relations that configure wage-labor with its necessarily more expansive condi-tions of reproduction: unpaid work. Elaborating an approach that seeks to translate the appropriation of work/energy into value, I argue for a conception of value-relations as co-produced through relations of exploitation (capital-labor) and appropriation (capital-unpaid work). This latter, accumulation by appropriation, is enabled by abstract social nature, the relational counterpoint to abstract <b>social</b> <b>labor.</b> If the substance of abstract so...|$|R

40|$|Every major {{religion}} has paid special attention toward {{the needs of}} the poor, the ill, and other categories of unprotected persons. This intercourse was clearly stressed in the holy books and manuscripts of these religions, and such human messages had direct impact on the conscience of the religions' numerous adherents, who thus undertake practical activities for providing help for those in need. Thanks to these messages from the religions, the first hospitals for free healing appeared, as well as the first boarding houses for poor folk and hostels for orphans. This charitable social activity, through the centuries, will make conditions for the appearance of <b>social</b> <b>labor.</b> On the other side, the religions left an eminent hallmark in education, not only through educational messages and instructions that they articulated, but also through the first organized forms of education and schools which originated exactly from the religious institutions. Such was the situation {{in different parts of the}} world. The impact of the religions on the social pedagogy can be assessed through two aspects. 1. Through the historical aspect. We shall see that the religions since the earliest times made an impact on the collective human conscience for later acceptance of the practical deeds of organized <b>social</b> <b>labor,</b> as well as social pedagogy as an integral part of the <b>social</b> <b>labor.</b> Each of the religions we are mentioning, through its institutions and official articulations, encouraged its believers to take charitable and humanitarian action through helping the hungry, the poor and all others who need help. With this, the religions played a considerable role in the social sphere of human habitation. They were first notional abetters in the history of humankind which directed social activities. Such activities left their trace and were transmitted in the conscience of all future generations, which in the end helped create organized <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> and <b>social</b> pedagogy. An important contribution in the historical impact of the religions, in the appearance of <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> and <b>social</b> pedagogy, was also made by educational messages and teachings which mainly addressed ethical behavior and which were also articulated from the religious institutions since earliest times. In this manner, the historical role of the religions in 6 the creation of the <b>social</b> <b>labor</b> and the <b>social</b> pedagogy, as a constitutive part of the <b>social</b> <b>labor,</b> was rounded down. The religions, through their institutions and organized articulations, actually acted in the social as well the educational spheres, and these two spheres today provide the foundation of the social pedagogy (which is both a social and an educational process). 2. The religions have another level of their connection with the social pedagogy. It is rare that a religion does not undertake educational activity through its institutions. Because a large part of this educational activity takes place through the school and the family, we can say that this educational activity (at least partially) can be treated as a social-pedagogy activity because, according to relevant definitions, social pedagogy is treated as a third educational domain, i. e. as an educational process apart from the school and the family. There is no doubt that the religion played an important role in the appearance of the social pedagogy, which is another strong proof for the magnificent contribution of the religion to human culture throughout histor...|$|R
