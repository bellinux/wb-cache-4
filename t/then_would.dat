5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who <b>then</b> <b>would</b> need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E

5|$|In early 1973, {{shortly after}} {{assuming}} {{the role of}} United States Attorney for Maryland, George Beall opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. Beall's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, and any misdeeds done <b>then</b> <b>would</b> be past the statute of limitations. As part of the investigation, Lester Matz's engineering firm was served with a subpoena for documents, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been kicking back to Agnew {{five percent of the}} value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor.|$|E

There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

5|$|The new Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, {{was also}} {{hesitant}} {{to fight a}} major battle. Instead, he ordered Warsaw to be fortified and allowed the Russians to cross the Vistula unopposed. In his opinion, the war could only be won diplomatically, by interventions of the United Kingdom, Austria and France. Should those fail, Skrzynecki believed Warsaw would hold out at least several weeks under a siege, after which the main bulk of the Polish Army would still be intact to fight a decisive battle against the Russians, who by <b>then</b> <b>would</b> be cut off from their rear by the Vistula. On 10 August 1831 Skrzynecki {{was forced to resign}} and was replaced by Henryk Dembiński, the military governor of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} they were just a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply to reach the battlefield and <b>then</b> <b>would</b> dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although it is clear that equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the same as for the alares.|$|E

The show ran for a total of 220 episodes until the show's cancellation in 2006. In 1998, the New York Friars' Club made Carey the newest inductee of the group's Comedy Central Roast. His friend Ryan Stiles (who costarred in The Drew Carey Show and Whose Line Is It Anyway?) served as the roastmaster. Carey's income from Whose Line Is It Anyway? and The Drew Carey Show led to his inclusion on the Forbes list of highest-paid entertainers of 1998, at 24th with $45.5 million.|$|E

The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area.

5|$|Monarchs {{sometimes}} went {{to great}} lengths to prevent this. On her marriage to Louis XIV of France, Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain, was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne. When monarchs or heirs apparent wed other monarchs or heirs, special agreements, sometimes in the form of treaties, were negotiated to determine inheritance rights. The marriage contract of Philip II of Spain and Mary I of England, for example, stipulated that the maternal possessions, as well as Burgundy and the Low Countries, were to pass to any future children of the couple, whereas the remaining paternal possessions (including Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan) would first of all go to Philip's son Don Carlos, from his previous marriage to Maria Manuela of Portugal. If Carlos were to die without any descendants, only <b>then</b> <b>would</b> they pass to the children of his second marriage. On the other hand, the Franco-Scottish treaty that arranged the 1558 marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots and Francis, the son and heir of Henry II of France, had it that if the queen died without descendants, Scotland would fall to the throne of France.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{followed}} up on the victory at Cerquín by sending two companies of soldiers to the Comayagua valley, {{under the command of}} Xuárez de Ávila and Alonso de Reinoso. He sent more soldiers into the mountainous regions around San Pedro, and personally commanded forays around Gracias a Dios to eliminate any isolated pockets of resistance there. The campaign in the Comayagua valley proved difficult; the Spanish were hindered by the broken terrain, while the natives were still determined to resist and had established fortified mountaintops in a similar fashion to the Peñol de Cerquín. In spite of supplies provided by Montejo, food was scarce, and it was difficult to replenish their stocks locally in the face of native hostility. The Indians launched fierce assaults from their fortresses, <b>then</b> <b>would</b> retreat to their mountain-tops, raining showers of arrows and boulders upon the attacking Spanish. Cavalry were nearly useless in the difficult terrain, and the Spanish were forced to resort to foot soldiers supported by light artillery. In response to the difficulty of the campaign, the two Spanish expeditions under Xúarez and Reinoso joined into a combined force. Cáceres had now returned to Gracias from the Peñol de Cerquín, so Montejo sent him to Comayagua with a strong detachment of soldiers and plentiful supplies. Although the campaign in the Comayagua valley drew on into 1538 without a decisive victory, the Spanish were able to reestablish the town of Santa María de Comayagua.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall <b>then</b> <b>would</b> go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even <b>then</b> <b>would</b> have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E
5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only <b>then</b> <b>would</b> a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E

The third mission was to destroy several bridges which spanned the River Dives, located near the towns of Varaville, Robehomme, Bures and Troarn. The division would then hold the territory that it had seized, until it could be relieved by advancing British ground forces.|$|E
