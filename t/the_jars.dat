25|$|Some relics {{brought back}} during the Crusades {{can also be found}} in the Cathedral: alleged remains of three Saints (Abibo, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus), and a vase that is said to be one of <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> of Cana.|$|E
25|$|The {{insides of}} amphorae were often {{coated with a}} {{preservative}} resin, such as from the terebinth, and this imparted a pine flavor and aroma to the wine. Before <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were sealed with pitch, they were filled completely and often topped with {{a thin layer of}} olive oil to prevent spoilage due to exposure to air.|$|E
5000|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into <b>the</b> <b>jar,</b> leaving some empty [...] "head space" [...] between {{the level of}} food {{and the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> <b>The</b> lid is placed on top of <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> with <b>the</b> {{integral}} rubber seal resting on the rim. A band is screwed loosely over the lid, allowing air and steam to escape. <b>The</b> <b>jar</b> is heat sterilized in boiling water or steam and the lid is secured. <b>The</b> <b>jar</b> is then allowed to cool to room temperature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> {{is placed}} above the ground, {{the higher the}} chain rises above <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> during <b>the</b> [...] "siphoning" [...] process. As {{demonstrated}} in an experiment, when <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> is placed 30 meters above {{the ground and the}} chain is sufficiently long, the arch of the chain fountain can reach about 2.1 meter above the opening of <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{argument}} {{states that}} there should be infinitely many marbles in <b>the</b> <b>jar,</b> because at each step before t = 1 the number of marbles increases from the previous step and does so unboundedly. A second argument, however, shows that <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> is empty. Consider the following argument: if <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> is non-empty, then there must be a marble in <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> Let us say that that marble is labeled with the number n. But at time t = 1 − 0.5n - 1, the nth marble has been taken out, so marble n cannot be in <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> This is a contradiction, so <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> must be empty. The Ross-Littlewood paradox is that here we have two seemingly perfectly good arguments with completely opposite conclusions.|$|R
25|$|While {{scholars}} generally {{agree that}} these murals confirm trade and cultural connections between India and Sassanian west, their specific significance and interpretation varies. Brancaccio, for example, {{suggests that the}} ship and jars in them probably reflect foreign ships carrying wine imported to India. In contrast, Schlinghoff interprets <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> to be holding water, and ships shown as Indian ships used in international trade.|$|E
25|$|Redi {{took six}} jars and divided them {{into two groups}} of three: In one experiment, in the first jar of each group, he put an unknown object; in the second, a dead fish; in the last, a raw chunk of veal. Redi covered {{the tops of the}} first group of jars with fine gauze so that only air could get into it. He left the other group open. After several days, he saw maggots appear on the objects in the open jars, on which flies had been able to land, but not in the gauze-covered jars. In the second experiment, meat was kept in three jars. One of <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> was {{uncovered}}, and two of <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were covered, one with cork and the other one with gauze. Flies could only enter the uncovered jar, and in this, maggots appeared. In the jar that was covered with gauze, maggots appeared on the gauze but did not survive.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ida use {{the lift}} cable {{to explore the}} pit, {{although}} the Doctor finds nothing but darkness far below. He then chooses to detach himself and fall, landing at the bottom thanks to an air cushion and finds that he can breathe. Finding cave paintings depicting the Beast's final battle and imprisonment, the Doctor discovers two jars on pedestals {{a few feet from}} each other as their light reveals the physical form of the Beast. The Doctor quickly deduces from the unintelligible grunts coming from the Beast that its consciousness has already escaped and that Krop Tor was designed as the perfect prison for the Beast: its jailers devised <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> as a failsafe, since their destruction would cause the planet to plunge into the black hole with the body of the Beast destroyed, and the mind killed in the process. Although the Doctor realises he must also sacrifice Rose and the others to destroy the Beast, he smashes <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> anyway on faith in his companion. As the planet falls out of orbit, the Doctor accepts his fate by mocking the Beast, before stumbling across his TARDIS while fleeing the collapsing cave.|$|E

25|$|Cato was {{an early}} {{advocate}} {{for the importance of}} hygiene in winemaking, recommending, for example, that wine jars be wiped clean twice a day with a new broom every time; thoroughly sealing <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> after fermentation to prevent the wine from spoiling and turning into vinegar; and not filling the amphoras to the top to leave some head space, leading to a small amount of oxidation. Cato's manual was fervently followed, becoming the standard textbook of Roman winemaking for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days before}} the {{discovery}} of KV55, Ayrton uncovered a recess in the rock (now designated as KVC) located immediately above the entrance to KV55 and containing jars of 20th dynasty type. This recess {{may have been an}} unfinished tomb commencement, and its content may be analogous to the embalming cache found in KV54, but because the find was never properly published, the precise nature of its contents, the date of <b>the</b> <b>jars,</b> and its relation (if any) to KV55 are now unclear.|$|E
25|$|According {{to sources}} at the time, {{the trade in}} large native Ruson-tsukuri (literally Luzon made in Japanese: or 呂宋つくり) clay jars used for storing green tea and rice wine with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinense potters had marked each jar with Baybayin letters {{denoting}} the particular urn used and the kiln <b>the</b> <b>jars</b> were manufactured in. Certain kilns were renowned over others and prices depended on {{the reputation of the}} kiln. Of this flourishing trade, the Burnay jars of Ilocos are the only large clay jar manufactured in Luzon today with origins from this time.|$|E

50|$|A killing jar is {{a device}} used by entomologists to kill {{captured}} insects quickly and with minimum damage. <b>The</b> <b>jar,</b> typically glass, must be hermetically sealable and one design has {{a thin layer}} of hardened plaster of paris on the bottom to absorb the killing agent. The killing agent will then slowly evaporate, allowing <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> to be used many times before needing to refresh <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> <b>The</b> absorbent plaster of paris layer also helps prevent the agent sticking to and damaging insects. Crumpled paper tissue is also placed in <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> for <b>the</b> same reason. A second method utilises a wad of cotton or other absorbent material placed in the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> Liquid killing agent is then added until the absorbent material is nearly saturated. A piece of stiff paper or cardboard cut to fit the inside of <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> tightly is then pressed in.|$|R

25|$|Although Sinop {{served as}} a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route {{predicted}} by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the Crimean peninsula. On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called amphorae, were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as olive oil, honey, wine or fish sauce but the contents are presently unknown because no artifacts were recovered from any of these wreck sites in 2000.|$|E
25|$|A {{post-mortem}} examination of Cook's body {{took place at}} the Talbot Arms on 26 November, carried out by medical student Charles Devonshire and assistant Charles Newton, and overseen by Dr Harland and numerous other onlookers. Newton was drunk, and Palmer himself interfered with the examination, bumping into Newton and taking the stomach contents off in a jar for 'safe keeping'. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> were sent off to Dr Alfred Swaine Taylor, who complained that such poor quality samples were of no use to him, and a second post mortem took place on 29 November. Postmaster Samuel Cheshire intercepted letters addressed to the coroner on behalf of Palmer; Cheshire was later prosecuted for interfering with the mail and given two years in prison. Palmer also wrote to the coroner himself, requesting that the verdict of death be given as natural causes, enclosing in his letter a £10 note.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{confusion}} about {{the purpose of a}} number of small stone and ceramic objects that are cigar-shaped and rasp-like. They are thought to be tools for creating pottery, of which bowls and jars seem to be the most common. <b>The</b> <b>jars</b> ranged from 12–44cm in diameter. The bowls were slightly smaller on average, ranging from 10–30cm. Many times these pots were decorated with a comb-like or rake pattern. These were likely used not only for the storage of food and water, but also for boiling and crafting sauces. The pottery appears to have been fired in a pit, typical of early ceramic practices. In fact, the pottery of Kintampo have been widely studied, in fact it is possibly the most studied later stone age ceramics in West Africa. Pieces of a substance known as daga has been found along with the stone artifacts. Daga is chunks of ceramics that have been visibly marked by sticks or other pole-like implements. Somewhat common at Kintampo sites, these are understood to represent occupation in dwellings.|$|E

50|$|How one {{answers the}} first {{question}} largely depends on {{the answer to the}} second question: should we interpret <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> to function as a prison, or a pantry? <b>The</b> <b>jar</b> certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released - they only affect humanity once outside <b>the</b> <b>jar.</b> Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that <b>the</b> <b>jar</b> acts as a prison for Elpis as well, withholding it from the human race.
