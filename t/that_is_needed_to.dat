5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that is all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that {{the court did not}} address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

These forms (see Linear equation for other forms) are generally named by the type of information (data) about the line <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, x-intercept, known points on the line and y-intercept.|$|E

A root systems is irreducible if and only if its Dynkin diagrams is connected. Dynkin diagrams encode the inner product on E in terms of the basis Δ, and the condition that this inner product must be positive definite turns out to be all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get the desired classification.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, Thomas Karsten {{presented}} a paper of the Indies Town Planning at the Decentralisation Congress. The paper was seen {{of a new}} radical idea in which Karsten argued that a town planning is an activity of interconnected components (social, technology, etc.) <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be addressed harmoniously. His idea for a methodological approach to create an organic town plan with a social dimension received much acclaim in the colony, {{as well as in}} the Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|Remnants of the Vision Serpent {{have survived}} until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S. Thompson noted in San Antonio, Belize, that the Q'eqchi' Maya still {{performed}} a ritual {{very similar to}} the vision quest of the classic Maya, although in a different context. The ritual marked the initiation of a new shaman for the village. The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan). It was through this experience that he completed his initiation rites and gained the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> become a powerful shaman.|$|E

25|$|The {{symptoms}} of esophageal spasm, erectile dysfunction, and abdominal pain {{are attributed to}} the fact that hemoglobin released during hemolysis binds with circulating nitric oxide, a substance <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> relax smooth muscle. This theory is supported by the fact that these symptoms improve on administration of nitrates or sildenafil (Viagra), which improves the effect of nitric oxide on muscle cells. There is a suspicion that chronic hemolysis causing chronically depleted nitric oxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the blood vessels supplying the lung), which in turn puts strain on the heart and causes heart failure.|$|E
25|$|The type {{of survey}} {{required}} {{depends on the}} information <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) {{as well as the}} natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the separative work units provided by an enrichment facility, the other important parameter to be considered is the mass of natural uranium (NU) <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> yield a desired mass of enriched uranium. As {{with the number of}} SWUs, the amount of feed material required will also depend on the level of enrichment desired and upon the amount of 235U that ends up in the depleted uranium. However, unlike the number of SWUs required during enrichment, which increases with decreasing levels of 235U in the depleted stream, the amount of NU needed will decrease with decreasing levels of 235U that end up in the DU.|$|E

There are small saline bags that have a screw off cap {{on the top of}} them to allow the powder to be added, commonly called piggy back bags by medical staff. Powdered Amoxicillin can be mixed with saline solution or sterile water to be used in a syringe, but because of the slow delivery time <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> inject the solution (3–4 minutes for solution containing 1g of amoxicillin powder) this method is seldom used.|$|E

They are required to wear their uniforms and to keep their helmets, equipment, chemical protective gear, and flak jackets with them. When possible, they are allowed to keep their weapons after the weapons have been cleared. They may serve on guard duty or as members of a standby quick reaction force.|$|E
25|$|The Brazilian {{rainforest}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically diverse regions of the world. Over a million species of plants and animals are known to live in the Amazon and many millions of species are unclassified or unknown. With the rapid process of deforestation the habitats of many animals and plants that live in the rainforests are under threat and species may face extinction. The deforestation has the effect of reducing a gene pool amongst species meaning that there is less genetic variation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> adapt to climate change in the future. The Brazilian Amazon is known to possess a vast resource for the treatments of medicines and scientific research into the basin has been conducted to find a cure for major global killers such as AIDS, cancer, and other terminal diseases.|$|E
