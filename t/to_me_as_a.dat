It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

500|$|American author Loretta Chase {{began her}} writing career in 1987 by {{crafting}} traditional novels in the Regency romance literary subgenre; Lord of Scoundrels, published in 1995, was her ninth such novel released. It {{was the third}} installment of her Débauchés (also known as Scoundrels) series, following The Lion's Daughter (1992) and Captives of the Night (1994). As such, some of the characters who feature in Lord of Scoundrels, such as the Comte d'Esmond and Francis Beaumont, also appear in previous Chase works. In 2007, Chase said Lord of Scoundrels was her only book [...] "that came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gift from the writing gods. Every other book is a struggle, some bloodier than others. This book was pure fun from start to finish".|$|E

500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement {{that her husband had}} handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E

I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|These letters set {{the tone}} for Tchaikovsky's {{relationship}} with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as [...] "precious <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you". Tchaikovsky was too self-critical not to see the truth behind these comments. He accepted Balakirev's criticism, and the two continued to correspond. Tchaikovsky would later destroy the score of Fatum. (The score would be reconstructed posthumously by using the orchestral parts.) ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively. He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put me on a pedestal, like, never mind that it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man? What have I not heard her say? That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, {{bombings and}} violent demonstrations {{led to a}} {{crackdown}} on dissent, with Castro and Raúl fleeing the country to evade arrest. Castro {{sent a letter to}} the press, declaring that he was [...] "leaving Cuba because all doors of peaceful struggle have been closed <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> follower of Martí, I believe the hour has come to take our rights and not beg for them, to fight instead of pleading for them." [...] The Castros and several comrades traveled to Mexico, where Raúl befriended an Argentine doctor and Marxist–Leninist named Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara, who was working as a journalist and photographer for [...] "Agencia Latina de Noticias". Fidel liked him, later describing him as [...] "a more advanced revolutionary than I was". Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, who agreed to teach Castro's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare. Requiring funding, Castro toured the U.S. in search of wealthy sympathizers, there being monitored by Batista's agents, who allegedly orchestrated a failed assassination attempt against him. Castro kept in contact with the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente. Other militant anti-Batista groups had sprung up, primarily from the student movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE), founded by José Antonio Echeverría. Antonio met with Castro in Mexico City, but Castro opposed the student's support for indiscriminate assassination.|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

500|$|Tim McCanlies {{was hired}} to write the script, though Bird was {{somewhat}} displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies {{decided to have a}} brief scene displaying his survival, stating, [...] "You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back." [...] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. [...] "didn't have time to mess with us" [...] as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as [...] "paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling." [...] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, [...] "I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He’s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> glorious piece of amazement.
