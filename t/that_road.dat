5|$|Past Route 23 and County Route 504, U.S. Route 202 heads {{north on}} Black Oak Ridge Road, a county {{maintained}} road that heads through residential neighborhoods. The road {{comes to an}} intersection with County Route 689 (Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike), where U.S. Route 202 merges onto <b>that</b> <b>road,</b> forming a concurrency. The Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike heads north past some businesses, running a short distance {{to the east of}} the Ramapo River, before coming to Terhune Drive, where U.S. Route 202 makes a right turn onto <b>that</b> <b>road</b> with County Route 689 continuing north on Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike. Terhune Drive carries U.S. Route 202 north through wooded neighborhoods, running in between Pines Lake to the east and Pompton Lake, {{which is part of the}} Ramapo River, to the west.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has been}} a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 when the state {{trunkline}} highway system was formed. It was a segment of the original M-10 that was replaced by US23 in 1926. Later changes to US23 shifted <b>that</b> <b>road</b> closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970.|$|E
5|$|At {{the point}} MD 2 merges onto the John Hanson Highway, {{the road is}} eight lanes wide. The road heads through wooded areas, {{narrowing}} to six lanes, before coming to an interchange with MD 70 (Rowe Boulevard). At this interchange, the unsigned I-595 designation ends, while US 50, US 301, and MD 2 continue northeast on the John Hanson Highway. The route passes under MD 436 (Ridgely Avenue) and runs near residential neighborhoods before crossing over the Severn River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. After crossing the Severn River, the road comes to an interchange with the Governor Ritchie Highway. Here, MD 2 leaves US 50/US 301 by heading north on the Governor Ritchie Highway while MD 450 continues south into Annapolis on <b>that</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{southeast}} quadrant from I-80 (at the time replacing US-40) at Parley's Canyon to 4600 South in Holladay began in mid-1965. This involved realigning Wasatch Boulevard to parallel the route and truncating <b>that</b> <b>road</b> at 3300 South. Prior to this, Wasatch Boulevard connected to US-40. The section from I-80 to 3300 South opened by January 1967, with the portion of roadway from 3300 South to 4500 South opening in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|N-88 was unofficially {{designated}} around 1937, connecting from N-29, to N-86 and N-19 in Bridgeport. The route {{remained relatively}} {{the same as}} the state highway system was officially designated. Before 1955, Nebraska did not have an adequate legal instrument to define the state highway system. By 1960, N-19 was renumbered to US 385, and US 26 was rerouted north near Bridgeport. The old alignment became part of N-92. Two years later, N-29 was renumbered to N-71. Between 1981-82, a road appeared on the official state map, extending from WYO 151 to N-71. <b>That</b> <b>road</b> became part of N-88 by 1986. No significant changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|Route 27 crosses into Newark, Essex County at the Virginia Street intersection, {{where it}} becomes Frelinghuysen Avenue, {{a road that}} heads north through the Dayton {{neighborhood}} of Newark, passing through urban areas and by Weequahic Park.

After capturing Bosanski Petrovac, elements were to be sent toward Drvar to prevent the withdrawal of Partisans along <b>that</b> <b>road</b> and to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Drvar.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the route predates the {{invention}} of the automobile; the Donner Party, California Trail and Pony Express all followed the present-day path of the highway. During the 1910s, the route was designated a state highway and, in 1939, State Route 201 was officially written into law, running from Magna east to the mouth of Parley's Canyon. At one point, the highway carried US-50 Alternate west of State Street and both US-40 and US-40 Alternate east of <b>that</b> <b>road,</b> though all were truncated from Salt Lake City by the late 1970s. Construction of the freeway portion of SR-201 west of I-15 commenced in the mid-1960s and was fully completed by 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} {{this stretch of}} SR52 had many effects on the {{transportation}} of the East County region. Traffic decreased significantly on I-8 in early 1994, with an estimated 30,000 commuters switching from I-8 to SR52. Fewer cars traveled on {{the western part of}} Mission Gorge Road, leading to a decrease in revenue for businesses located along <b>that</b> <b>road.</b> On Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road in Santee, much more traffic was present, leading to residents complaining to the city. In 1998, the city began to widen Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Drive and Fanita Road to handle the extra traffic from the incomplete SR52.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} two other {{highways}} to bear the M-84 moniker. The first was one in the Upper Peninsula and the second was in The Thumb area. The current highway was originally part of M-47 until <b>that</b> <b>road</b> was relocated onto what was formerly US10 in the Tri-Cities area. Since the 1960s reuse of the number, M-84 has been extended in the 1970s to replace part of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75, now Business Spur I-75, BS I-75) in Bay City. Other projects have reconstructed and widened the roadway through the Bay City area in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Two other roads {{have been}} {{numbered}} Utah SR-58 in the past. The first route designated SR-58 {{was formed in}} 1945 between SR-36 and Clover, but was ed in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between I-15 in New Harmony back to I-15 via Kanarraville, but <b>that</b> <b>road</b> was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between the state line and the junction with Frontage Road, which was formerly US40. Wendover Boulevard between US93Alt. and the state line was designated SR224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County.|$|E

5|$|While a {{cut-and-fill}} tunnel for Yellow Line {{was built}} under 7th Street and U Street, both street traffic and pedestrian access on those streets were difficult. The {{result was the}} loss of the traditional retail businesses along the route. The downtown segment of the line was originally projected to open in September 1977. Obtaining approval of the District of Columbia and Prince Georges' County of the exact alignment of the Yellow Line north of U Street delayed construction. Originally, the ARS called for the line to be placed in the median strip of the planned North Central Freeway, but after <b>that</b> <b>road</b> was cancelled, the route of the replacement subway tunnel became controversial, resulting in years of expensive delays.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north of}} Manotick through fields, Highway416 is crossed by the Prescott Highway {{for the fourth}} and final time as <b>that</b> <b>road</b> turns {{northeast}} and travels into downtown Ottawa as Prince of Wales Drive. Shortly thereafter is an interchange with Brophy Drive / Bankfield Road; the latter provides access to the Prescott Highway / Prince of Wales Drive. Approaching urban Ottawa, the route passes alongside a large quarry, then jogs to the west along an S-curve, crossing the Jock River in the process. After this, an interchange with Fallowfield Road provides access to the suburb of Barrhaven which occupies portions of the land immediately east of the freeway. The route jogs back to the east along a second S-curve and passes through an aesthetically designed bridge while traveling alongside the Stony Swamp.|$|E
5|$|East of Rochester, NY31 {{continued}} eastward to Jordan, {{utilizing the}} Rochester–Pittsford portion of legislative Route14, the Perinton–Jordan segment of Route20, and its current alignment between Pittsford and Perinton.

NY31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route31, current NY31, and Downer Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 followed Downer Street and what is now NY48 along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east {{to what is now}} NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E
