5|$|At 07:00 on 29 April, Major General Smith advised Ambassador Martin that {{fixed-wing}} evacuations should cease {{and that}} Operation Frequent Wind, the helicopter evacuation of US personnel and at-risk Vietnamese should commence. Ambassador Martin {{refused to accept}} General Smith's recommendation and instead insisted on visiting Tan Son Nhut to survey the situation for himself. At 10:00 Ambassador Martin confirmed General Smith's assessment and at 10:48 he contacted Washington to recommend Option 4, the helicopter evacuation. Finally at 10:51 the order was given by CINCPAC to commence Option 4; due to confusion {{in the chain of}} command, General Carey did not receive the execute order until 12:15.

5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la RÃºa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to <b>the</b> <b>complete</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> market access and intensified capital flight by {{the second quarter of}} 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Japanese breeders began to {{selectively}} breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing, but {{the events of}} World War II led to <b>the</b> <b>complete</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries. Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies. These quail {{are closely related to}} the common quail, and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that {{happened}} during the growth of Limusaurus is <b>the</b> <b>complete</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, {{as well as the}} sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or resorption. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. CT scanning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all of the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth sockets have been obliterated.|$|E

50|$|Much {{was learned}} by the Soviet command from the raid, and it {{probably}} gave further impetus to create the new tank armies as independent formations capable of conducting sustained operations deep in the enemy rear. <b>The</b> almost <b>complete</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipment and that {{of many of the}} personnel of 24th Tank Corps also brought home the truth that operating so deep behind enemy lines carried exceptional risks.|$|R
5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, <b>the</b> <b>complete</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the affected sound, or even {{the introduction of a}} new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E

40|$|N 2 O uptake {{activity}} of cells and N 2 O reductase {{activity of}} the soluble fraction from denitrifying bacteria were assayed.
