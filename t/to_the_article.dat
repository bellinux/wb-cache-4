5|$|After {{the article}} was published, over one hundred {{prominent}} intellectuals, {{including some of the}} people Szabó had denounced, published a letter of support for him. Szabó’s initial response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> was that informing had been an act of bravery intended {{to save the life of}} former classmate Pál Gábor. When this claim turned out not to be true, Szabó admitted that his true motive had been to prevent his own expulsion from the Academy.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>article.</b> Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E
5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>article,</b> it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in their opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>article</b> {{in an attempt to}} generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>article,</b> workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers. In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E

5|$|Huggins {{set up a}} Defence Committee {{within the}} Cabinet to {{co-ordinate}} the colony's war effort in early 1940. This body comprised the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister Jacob Smit, Tredgold and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest, the Minister of Mines and Public Works, who {{was put in charge}} of the new Air Ministry. About 1,600 of the colony's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when, during the Battle of France, Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities to call up any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and a half and 25 who had lived in the colony for at least six months. The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942. Part-time training was compulsory for all white males between 18 and 55, with a small number of exceptions for those in reserved occupations. On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia, the last country to join the EATS, became the first to start operating an air school under it, beating Canada by a week. The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, with No.1 Squadron becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons, namely No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron (in 1940) and No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron (1941), in a manner similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Article</b> XV squadrons from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|E
