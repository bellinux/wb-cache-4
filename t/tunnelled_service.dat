50|$|A utility tunnel, utility corridor, or utilidor is {{a passage}} built {{underground}} or above ground to carry utility lines such as electricity, steam, water supply pipes, and sewer pipes. Communications utilities like fiber optics, cable television, and telephone cables are also sometimes carried. One {{may also be}} referred to as a <b>services</b> <b>tunnel,</b> <b>services</b> trench, services vault, or cable vault. Smaller cable containment {{is often referred to as}} a cable duct or underground conduit. Direct-buried cable is a major alternative to ducts or tunnels.|$|R

2500|$|The {{objective}} was to construct two [...] rail tunnels, [...] apart, [...] in length; a [...] <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the two main ones; pairs of [...] cross-passages linking the rail <b>tunnels</b> to the <b>service</b> one at [...] spacing; piston relief ducts [...] in diameter connecting the rail tunnels [...] apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail <b>tunnels,</b> with the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> always preceding the main ones by at least [...] to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem.

2500|$|Initial {{geological}} investigation occurred from 1946 to 1963, {{which involved}} drilling the sea-bed, sonic surveys, submarine boring, observations using a mini-submarine, and seismic and magnetic surveys. To establish a greater understanding, a horizontal pilot boring was undertaken {{along the line}} of the <b>service</b> and main <b>tunnels.</b> Tunnelling occurred simultaneously from the northern end and the southern. The dry land portions were tackled with traditional mountain tunnelling techniques, with a single main tunnel. However, for the 23.3-kilometre undersea portion, three bores were excavated with increasing diameters respectively: an initial pilot <b>tunnel,</b> a <b>service</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and finally the main <b>tunnel.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> was periodically connected to the main tunnel with a series of connecting shafts, at 600- to 1,000-metre intervals. The pilot tunnel serves as the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> for the central five-kilometre portion. Beneath the Tsugaru Strait, the use of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) was abandoned after less than two kilometres (...) owing to the variable nature of the rock and difficulty in accessing the face for advanced grouting. Blasting with dynamite and mechanical picking were then used to excavate.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} was to construct two 7.6 m rail tunnels, 30 m apart, 50 km in length; a 4.8 m <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> between the two main ones; pairs of 3.3 m cross-passages linking the rail <b>tunnels</b> to the <b>service</b> one at 375 m spacing; piston relief ducts 2 m in diameter connecting the rail tunnels 250 m apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail <b>tunnels,</b> with the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> always preceding the main ones by at least 1 km to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem.

50|$|The tunnel {{breakthrough}} {{took place}} on Christmas Day 1870. The first train ran through the tunnel on 16 Sep 1871. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>service</b> started on 16 October 1871 and the MCR service ended on the previous day. The MCR began to run at a loss in 1871. They applied to the Italian government for a subsidy but this was refused. At {{the same time they}} could not stop the service because of the concession agreement.|$|R
50|$|The westernmost part of {{the line}} entailed {{aggressive}} completion of the 63rd Street Tunnel, {{as well as the}} connections from the tunnel to the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line. The 63rd Street portion of the line would reduce overcrowding on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, on the IRT Flushing Line, and on the 60th Street <b>Tunnel's</b> <b>services.</b> The 63rd Street <b>tunnel</b> would facilitate <b>service</b> between the Queens Boulevard Line and the Second Avenue Subway, via bellmouths west of Roosevelt Island which turn south towards Midtown and Lower Manhattan; these turnouts may be used for the third and fourth phases of a new Second Avenue Subway project, which started in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Wirral Railway {{subsequently}} {{became part}} of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, who renamed the station Birkenhead North in 1926. The line through Birkenhead North was electrified, using a 650v DC third rail system, and brought into passenger service on 14 March 1938, allowing through services from New Brighton to Liverpool Central via the Mersey Railway <b>Tunnel.</b> <b>Services</b> used the new LMS trains and the former Mersey Railway electric units. The Mersey Railway electric units operated through the station until 1957.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tunnels</b> <b>service</b> have primary {{responsibility}} for these areas, meaning they enforce the Mersey Tunnels bylaws and like all other police services the various and relevant UK statute law/legislation although perhaps {{by the nature of}} the role primarily the Road Traffic Act. Mersey Tunnels Police officers are the first line responders to any incidents or emergencies within the tunnels or premises although certain incidents and enquiries of a serious nature may be dealt with by Merseyside Police in accordance with local agreements between the two services.|$|R

2500|$|Historically, QB and QT {{services}} have operated on the BMT Brighton Line via the Manhattan Bridge and Montague Street Tunnel respectively, though the <b>tunnel</b> <b>service</b> was later discontinued.

In 2010, the Q {{was extended to}} Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard in Queens, but rerouted to the Second Avenue Subway in 2017.|$|R
50|$|Early {{operation}} in the tunnels was dominated by removal of excavation debris from the tunnel itself, and once <b>tunnel</b> <b>service</b> reached various areas, several construction contractors {{found that it was}} less expensive to dump excavation debris down into tunnel trains than it was to haul it out through the congested streets of the Chicago Loop. As a result, excavation debris continued to make up a significant part of tunnel traffic after the tunnel system was completed. Ash from coal-fired furnaces was freely mixed with this stream of debris.|$|R

5|$|The westernmost part of {{the line}} entailed {{aggressive}} completion of the 63rd Street Tunnel, {{as well as the}} connections from the tunnel to the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line. The 63rd Street tunnel under the East River would have two subway tracks on its upper level and two LIRR tracks on its lower level.

2500|$|The <b>service</b> <b>tunnel</b> is {{used for}} access to {{technical}} equipment in cross-passages and equipment rooms, to provide fresh-air ventilation and for emergency evacuation. The <b>Service</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to {{all areas of the}} <b>tunnel.</b> The <b>service</b> vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. [...] "Pods" [...] with different purposes, up to a payload of , are inserted {{into the side of the}} vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is [...] when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light <b>Service</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a [...] turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the <b>service</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is [...] Pods up to 1tonne can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.|$|R
