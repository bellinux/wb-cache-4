The study addresses the rising cases of TOC activities in India; the country is currently affected by various criminal activities which are transnational in nature. Such include smuggling, firearms trafficking, human and drug trafficking, prostitution, kidnapping and cybercrimes. Criminal networks are expanding and diversifying their activities. Thus TOCs impair the social and economic development. The study also discusses the impact of TOCs in different sectors of the country. The study further analyses the major challenges the government faces to deal with the problems and recommends how to weaken the criminal network in the country...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{non-traditional}} security {{has opened up}} a new debate {{in the arena of}} international relations. In recent years, scholars have paid greater attention to emerging non-traditional security issues such as terrorism, <b>transnational</b> <b>organized</b> <b>crimes,</b> public health epidemics, climate change, immigration and refugee crises, and transnational resource conflicts, all of which constitute threats to the regional stability of South and East Asia. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of relations between two competing neighbours, China and India, by analysing their multilateral non-traditional security cooperation. Traditionally, the biggest problem for cooperation in this field has been boundary disputes. This paper therefore seeks to clarify the connection between issues of traditional and non-traditional security cooperation between China and India, and then evaluate aspects of Sino-Indian collaboration in non-traditional security. We argue that non-traditional security offers favourable and practical options to enhance peaceful bilateral relations between China and India. In particular, “peace-cooperationism” and “pluralistic win-win” are ideal paradigms for Sino-Indian non-traditional security cooperation...|$|R

As a nation, Indonesia {{has been trying to}} eradicate corruption because it has been ruining Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s vision to ensure the prosperity and security of its people. The eradication agenda became priority as the level and impact of corruption escalated drastically in Soeharto 2 ̆ 7 s reign and fall. Corruption becomes more complex as it involves International actors and using more complicate methods. Indonesia realized that different approach should be used to strengthen the eradication agenda, especially to use International cooperation. Researcher focused on the national interest of Indonesia that became a prominent factor of Indonesia to propose the corruption and non traditional security issues in the building process of ASEAN Community. It resulted on agreement to make a pillar of the community that focus on politic and security issues, namely as ASEAN Political-Security Community (APSC).

40|$|In 1999, the Government of Indonesia {{established}} Government Regulation (GR) 32 / 1999 on the Procedures for The Implementation of the Rights of Inmates and {{has been}} amended lastly by GR 99 / 2012. However, the establishment of GR 99 / 2012 creates complication and unfairly discriminates against inmates committing to an extraordinary crimes (terrorism, drug abuse, corruption, crimes against {{the security of the}} state, crimes against humanity and other <b>transnational</b> <b>organized</b> <b>crimes)</b> that impedes such inmates to submit remission and parole. This paper examines the consistency between the implementation of GR 99 / 2012 and the concept of criminal punishment in Indonesia. This paper is a summary of empirical juridical research that reports the influences of GR 99 / 2012 on inmates in correctional institutions. Data used for this research was obtained from interviews, observation, desk reviews and focus group discussion with government officials. Based on the findings, it could be inferred that GR 99 / 2012 has impeded the fulfillment of the inmate 2 ̆ 7 s rights on parole and remission due to complication of procedures, additional fines, and multi interpretation of the regulation. Furthermore, it affects the aggravation of overcrowding, violations against inmate 2 ̆ 7 s rights, and illegal practices within the process. Based on the analysis as discussed in this paper, GR 99 / 2012 is inconsistent with the concept of criminal punishment in Indonesia because it impedes inmates to return within society. This paper proposes that GR 99 / 2012 should be revoked and revised in accordance with the spirit of Corrections Act and to creat synergy among law enforcers in fulfilling the inmate 2 ̆ 7 s rights...|$|R

This is a descriptive qualitative research, where {{the data was collected}} by using case files, and structured interviews.  This research is conducted by analyzing files of clandestine laboratory cases that occurred in Indonesia in last five years. The results of this research answers questions about what factors  encourage the development of clandestine laboratory in Indonesia.  These factors are, the easiness to obtain chemicals, chemical devices, and also cooperation with foreign syndicates, which often employ drugs designer to produce illegal drugs. This research concludes that the clandestine laboratory can be developed in Indonesia because the perpetrator’s accesses to get basic chemicals drugs maker (precursor) are very easy, the use of controlled legal chemicals are leak frequently and it was used to make drugs, free sales of supporting chemical devices, and involvement of foreign drugs designer to teach how to make drugs. The results of this study tell that clandestine laboratory will continue to increase if the minimization of the perpetrator access to produce the drugs done as early as possible.  Certainly, the phenomenon of clandestine laboratory can be minimized, at least to suppress the circulation of drugs in Indonesia itself...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} without a {{realistic}} understanding of criminal enterprise located against the commercial forces shaping contemporary Asian market contexts, then domestic, bi-lateral, regional and international control initiatives are not only likely to fail in their regulatory objectives, but the premises on which they are constructed may heighten the market conditions for crime business profitability. The international convention-based approach to regulating <b>transnational</b> and <b>organized</b> <b>crime</b> is the framework from which a critique of non-market centred law enforcement control concentrations is developed. This critique reveals the transposition of flawed normative control considerations from domestic to supra-national control contexts, and shows how this in turn constrains and is constrained by <b>organized</b> <b>crime</b> research. The paper suggests a novel methodology for understanding Asian crime business in its specific market realities and conditions. The analysis calls for a shift away from the normative ascription to supply directed regulatory emphasis. In conclusion, conventional crime control perspectives and directives can usefully be critiqued from their international {{as well as their}} domestic frames, enabling the creation of a refined and holistic legal response at each level that is supported by and not retarded with holistic research understanding...|$|R

Such ‘wicked problems’ and messes are seemingly intractable problems characterized as value-laden, ambiguous, and unstable, that resist being tamed by classical problem solving. Actions and interventions associated with this complex problem space can have highly unpredictable and unintended consequences. Examples of such complex problems include health care reform, global climate change, <b>transnational</b> serious and <b>organized</b> <b>crime,</b> terrorism, homeland security, human security, disaster management, and humanitarian aid. Moving towards the development of solutions to these complex problem spaces depends on the lens we use to examine them and how we frame the problem. It will be shown that systems thinking and soft operations research has had great success in contributing to the management of complexity. ...|$|R

Such crime {{networks}} span beyond protected areas holding strongholds of species of interest such as African rhinos. Such networks extend over several countries and hence beyond the jurisdiction of any one law enforcement authority. We show how a federated database can overcome disjoint information kept in different databases. We also show how social network analyses can provide law enforcers with targeted responses that maximally disrupt a criminal network. We introduce an actionable intelligence report using social network measures that identifies key players and predicts player succession. Using a rhino case study we illustrate how such a report can be used to optimize enforcement operations.|$|R
