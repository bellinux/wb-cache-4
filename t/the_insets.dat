40|$|The {{central focus}} of this study {{concerns}} the impact in Korea of an in-service teacher training (INSET) course on teachers’ classroom practice and their perception change. A qualitative case study involving observation and interviews was carried out {{during a period of}} six months before and after an <b>INSET</b> course. <b>The</b> three-week <b>INSET</b> course itself was observed. This was followed by the observation of five consecutive English lessons given by the two teachers. The teachers also took part in four semi-structured interviews. While the observations shed light on how the teachers implemented what they had learnt from <b>the</b> <b>INSET</b> into their teaching practice, the interviews explored a range of issues. These included their general expectations and outcomes of <b>the</b> <b>INSET</b> course, their perception changes and difficulties in putting new ideas into practice. Interviews also explored their perceptions of longer-term outcomes. The main finding in this study indicated that the two teachers faced some difficulties and challenges in implementing new ideas or knowledge obtained from <b>the</b> <b>INSET</b> course into their classroom practice, and did not do so to the same extent. The contextual differences between <b>the</b> <b>INSET</b> and real practice, the content of <b>the</b> <b>INSET,</b> and lack of school support were identified as constraining factors that limit implementation. The analysis also showed that the teachers’ confidence and motivation resulting from <b>the</b> <b>INSET</b> led to their better career prospects and affected their professional identity. Some important implications from the study for language teacher training are discussed to highlight how the potential impact of INSET could be optimised: (i) INSET should provide ongoing support to promote developmental continuity after <b>the</b> course; (ii) <b>INSET</b> should consider teaching contexts sensitively, especially large classes and limited materials; and (iii) trainees continue their professional development under their own initiative even after <b>the</b> <b>INSET</b> course.

50|$|Near {{completion}} of the structure, Webb learned that sculptor Alec Miller was in the United States because of World War II, and lacked the funds {{to return to his}} native Scotland. Miller was well known in England because of his carvings for the cathedral at Coventry. Webb hired the artist at a modest fee, plus room and board, to design the furnishings (Miller called them “fitments”) for the chapel. Miller lived with the Webbs for three years while he designed the chapel’s “fitments” and <b>the</b> <b>insets</b> for the chapel’s entrance doors. The chapel was completed in 1944; the bell tower was added later.|$|E

The linear structural map summarized primarily {{from studies of}} chicken calponin 1 illustrates the structural {{and functional}} domains of calponin. The CH domain, two actin-binding sites, three repeating sequence motifs, and the C-terminal variable region are outlined. The CH domain overlaps with the ERK signaling binding region. Amino acid sequences of the two actin-binding sites in the three isoforms and the three repeating motifs of calponin 1 are shown in <b>the</b> <b>insets.</b> The regulatory phosphorylation sites Ser175 and Thr184 {{are located in the}} second actin-binding site that overlaps with the first repeating motif. Potentially phosphorylatable serine residues corresponding to Ser175 are conserved in repeats 2 and 3, while a Thr184 equivalent is conserved in repeat 2. Different from calponin 1 and calponin 3, calponin 2 has a potentially phosphorylatable additional serine at position 177.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{ordinary}} magnetic hysteresis measurement, [...] starts {{at a large}} positive value and is decreased to a large negative value. The magnetization direction starts on the blue curve. At [...] the red curve appears, but for [...] the blue state has a lower energy because it {{is closer to the}} direction of the magnetic field. When the field becomes negative, the red state has the lower energy, but the magnetization cannot immediately jump to this new direction because there is an energy barrier in between (see <b>the</b> <b>insets).</b> At , however, the energy barrier disappears, and in more negative fields the blue state no longer exists. It must therefore jump to the red state. After this jump, the magnetization remains on the red curve until the field increases past , where it jumps to the blue curve. Usually only the hysteresis loop is plotted; the energy maxima are only of interest if the effect of thermal fluctuations is calculated.|$|E

To do this, we assign a Landau level (LL) index number N to each resistance minimum (N[*]+[*] 1 / 2 to each resistance maximum) as shown in Fig.  3 a, b by arrows. The Landau level index N versus reversal magnetic field induction 1 /B (Landau fan diagram) is shown in <b>the</b> <b>insets</b> of Fig.  3 a, b. As it is obvious from <b>the</b> <b>insets</b> of Fig.  3 a, b, the data points fall on a straight line and the solid line represents the best linear fit. The intercept of the linear fit with the N-index axis yields zero phase β[*]=[*] 0 that indicates in Schrodinger electron transport responsible for SdH oscillations.|$|E
