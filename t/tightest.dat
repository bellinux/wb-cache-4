5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the <b>tightest</b> known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E

The <b>tightest</b> level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open.

Shortly after the controversies at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 {{to deliver the}} final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, so the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested {{by one of the}} <b>tightest</b> votings (213-213) in the entire history of the House of Representatives. The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. general Wesley Clark. Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of military targets. As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999.|$|E

30|$|In this article, <b>tight</b> {{oil and gas}} {{accumulation}} {{refers to}} that occurring in low-permeability reservoirs that are not source rocks or shale, which primarily includes petroleum accumulations in <b>tight</b> sandstone and <b>tight</b> carbonate reservoirs. Accordingly, such reservoirs are known as <b>tight</b> reservoirs. Two models were proposed to interpret hydrocarbon accumulations in such <b>tight</b> reservoirs as <b>tight</b> sandstones, which are: (1) the deep-basin or basin-centered gas model, {{also known as the}} continuous accumulation model; and (2) the conventional trap-controlled accumulation model. Recently, Zhao et al. (2012 a, 2013, 2016 a) proposed a new model termed quasi-continuous accumulation and demonstrated that <b>tight</b> oil and gas are dominated by quasi-continuous accumulation, while discontinuous (conventional trap-controlled) accumulations are of subordinate importance. Zhao et al. (2016 a) also argued that the so-called continuous (basin-centered) accumulations actually do not exist in non-source-rock <b>tight</b> reservoirs such as <b>tight</b> sandstones. Hence, two types of hydrocarbon accumulations can be caused in <b>tight</b> petroleum systems, namely the quasi-continuous accumulation and discontinuous accumulation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tight</b> geodesics were {{introduced}} by Masur-Minsky in [17]. They and their hierarchies {{have been a}} powerful tool {{in the study of}} the curve complex, mapping class groups, Teichmüller spaces, and hyperbolic 3 -manifolds. In the same paper, they showed that there are at least one and at most finitely many <b>tight</b> geodesics between any two vertices in the curve complex. Bowditch found a uniform finiteness property on <b>tight</b> geodesics [9], and this property has given further important applications in some of the above studies. In this paper, we introduce classes of geodesics which are not <b>tight</b> but still have the uniform finiteness property. These classes of geodesics will be obtained as examples of weak <b>tight</b> geodesics which {{were introduced}} and shown to have the property in [19]. The aim of this paper is to study about weak <b>tight</b> geodesics focusing on giving examples of them with canonical constructions and investigating gaps between two classes of them. Our main investigation will be on weak <b>tight</b> geodesics contained in the class of M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics where M is the bound given by the bounded geodesic image theorem. As M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics contain <b>tight</b> geodesics, the classes of weak <b>tight</b> geodesics to be introduced in this paper will live around <b>tight</b> geodesics.
