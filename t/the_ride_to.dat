5|$|In September 2017, {{a report}} with photos {{surfaced}} that {{the braking system}} on the launch side of the track may have been damaged, causing <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> close indefinitely. Cedar Point did not acknowledge the incident and stated the closure was for maintenance reasons.|$|E
5|$|The ride had {{constant}} downtime in {{its first}} couple seasons. Several problems such as the ride's hydraulic system and launch cable caused <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> experience downtime. Top Thrill Dragster was also closed in 2003 for the annual event, CoasterMania.|$|E
5|$|Dæmonen {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. This configuration allows <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,200 riders per hour. The structure of the trains are colored orange; the seats and restraints are black. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Dæmonen has no floor on its trains.|$|E

5|$|Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović left Belgrade by boat on 28 May and {{traveled}} along the Sava River to Šabac where they handed the small card to Captain Popović of the Serbian Border Guard. Popović, in turn, {{provided them with}} a letter to Serbian Captain Prvanović, and filled out a form {{with the names of}} three customs officials whose identities they could assume and thereby receive discounted train tickets for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> Loznica, a small border town.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons Ride uses new {{technology}} that cuts down on its energy consumption. According to Universal Studios, the ride is able to save over 55,000 watts on average and 662,000 watt-hours per day. The ride includes over 2,500 LEDs, the largest number in theme park history, which allows <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> cut down on lighting energy by almost one quarter when compared to incandescent lighting.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 {{boundary}} redistribution {{saw only}} minor changes {{made in the}} middle of <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>to</b> align with changes to the Medicine Hat city limits.|$|R

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> Candyland, {{they come}} across a group of Calvin's slave {{trackers}} cornering one of Calvin's Mandingo fighters, D'artagnan, who tried to run away due to no longer wanting to fight. Calvin says that because he bought D'artagnan for $500, D'artagnan (who has only fought three times) must fight at least five times. When Django and Dr. Schultz offer to reimburse Calvin and then change their minds, Calvin has his chief tracker, Mr. Stonecipher, unleash several attack dogs that tear D'artagnan to pieces.|$|E
5|$|Griffon {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains, colored red, yellow, and black. Each train has three rows that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,400 riders per hour. Unlike traditional roller coasters, Griffon's trains are floorless, allowing the riders' legs to dangle throughout the ride. Riders also experience up to 4 times the force of gravity.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{election}} campaign, Housefather {{had promised to}} hold quarterly town hall meetings in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>to</b> give constituents a report on {{what is happening in}} Ottawa and in <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> and <b>to</b> take questions as he did as Mayor. The first town hall meeting was held in Hampstead in January and the second was held in the Town of Mount Royal in April. [...] The meetings are called Anthony’s Assemblies.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 {{boundary}} redistribution saw <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> significantly changed. <b>The</b> Electoral Boundary Commission originally tried <b>to</b> abolish <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> {{but several}} complaints were {{submitted to the}} Commission. Instead <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> was completely redrawn with the north boundary pushed up to the Bow River from 17 Avenue SW into land {{that was part of}} Calgary-Bow and Calgary-Buffalo. The east boundary which had gone as far as 1 Street SE was moved west to 14 Street SW losing land to Buffalo and Calgary-Elbow. The south boundary was significantly revised with Elbow causing <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>to</b> gain and lose land with that constituency in a few different places and finally the west boundary was straightened out to run along Sarcee Trail causing <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>to</b> gain land from Calgary-West.|$|R
5|$|Shambhala {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has eight cars with two rows that seat two riders each {{for a total}} of 32 riders per train; each seat has its own individual lap-bar restraint. This configuration allows <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,680 riders per hour. Riders also experience up to 3.8 times the force of gravity. The structure of the trains are colored gold and cyan, the lap bar restraints are cyan, and the seats are black.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used on the ride vehicles could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Sudbury's {{growth in}} {{population}} led <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>to</b> shrink further. It now included only the northern {{half of the}} city; the city's southern half was incorporated into Nickel Belt.|$|R
50|$|The {{nomination}} {{was held on}} May 28, 1926. Frame was acclaimed as the candidate due to incumbent George Mills protesting the hastily called date that prevented party members from the northern portion of <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> <b>to</b> attend.|$|R

25|$|On May 12, 2016, a {{malfunction}} caused <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> stop, stranding 64 riders 200 {{feet in the}} air for 1 hour. Busch Gardens officials evacuated all of the 64 riders safely, and {{no injuries}} were reported. Sheikra reopened on May 16, 2016.|$|E
25|$|In April 1998, a dime-sized {{plastic nut}} came loose on The Mighty Axe (now called Tak Attack), causing <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> {{come to a}} stop with riders stuck upside down at the very top. The loose nut had {{interrupted}} the power to the seating platform. The five riders were stuck for about an hour before park mechanics were able to get them down.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> the Champs-Élysées is {{traditionally}} free of attacks {{prior to the}} famous avenue, and the GC standings from the previous stage usually stand as the final result, as only sprinters (who are very low in the GC at this point) will usually attack. However, with only 31 seconds separating the top three men, there was much speculation that {{that would not be}} the case during this final stage.|$|E

25|$|Mankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted {{notes for}} Kennedy's use, {{but he refused}} them, using some he likely had written during <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> the site. The Indianapolis chief of police advised Kennedy {{that he could not}} provide {{protection}} and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered leader. Kennedy decided to go ahead. Standing on a flatbed truck, Kennedy spoke for four minutes and fifty-seven seconds.|$|E
25|$|On 14 March 2009, {{the ride}} was {{scheduled}} to officially open to the public. However, {{less than two hours}} after the park's opening, the ride was shut down due to technical difficulties (braking and sensor failures) and did not re-open {{for the remainder of the}} day, and was also closed for the following day. Thorpe Park offered complimentary tickets to all guests who had bought tickets at the gate, and free priority passes for <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> all annual pass holders.|$|E
25|$|Hazard and {{direction}} signs, rest stops, and route marshals are organised {{for the ride}} each day, including marshals on motorbikes and in vehicles, and directing traffic at major intersections. A group of volunteer riders called WARBYs (We Are Right Behind You) ride throughout the field, providing emergency assistance for bicycle breakdowns and rider difficulties. A number of sag wagons accompany <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>to</b> pick up riders and bikes {{who are unable to}} continue due to their bicycle being beyond roadside repair, injury, sickness, or general weariness.|$|E
50|$|On {{election}} day, Schellenberger defeated Innes by 1,000 votes.
