On the other hand, the learning algorithms for updating <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>weights</b> use constant learning rates. This overcomes the shortcoming of the learning rates approaching zero. In addition, the proposed algorithms are globally convergent {{so that it is}} very simple to choose the initial values of the learning parameters. This paper presents the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms by studying the corresponding deterministic discrete time (DDT) equations. Rigorous mathematical proof is given to prove the global convergence. The theoretical results are further confirmed via simulations...|$|R

This price was determined every two months as the average net selling price of coal delivered free on board at the docks of Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and Barry.The hewers received piece rates based on <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of coal extracted after eliminating small coal, paid every two weeks.The Sliding-Scale committee had to mediate constant disputes over wages between members.The Times of 29 December 1891 described the Association as follows,The Times went on to describe that the men were fully aware of the huge resources of the mineowner, backed up by the Association, and also that if they worked at a colliery immediately before a strike they would not be employed by any of the Association members.
