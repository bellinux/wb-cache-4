National League (NL) president John Heydler insisted {{that anyone who}} played with O'Connell could be suspended. The Giants were also displeased with Kelly's arrangement, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the chance he could injure himself in non-baseball activity. However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He {{was removed from the}} roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator John Glenn, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} of 35, which {{included}} Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded {{that it would be}} a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> their careers, but decided to volunteer.|$|E

He carried President Polk's request for a battalion of 500 volunteers {{to fight in the}} Mexican War. Most members of the Church were suspicious of the request, as the Federal government had ignored the persecutions they suffered. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> facing discrimination by the government, as they had from both the state and federal government in the past.|$|E

25|$|Conflict {{began to}} emerge from the start of mining {{operations}} at Panguna. Many of the local landowners were opposed to the mine because it attracted an influx of workers from other parts of PNG. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> adverse environmental effects, while seeing most of the mine profits leaving the island. Prior to Papua New Guinea's independence in 1975, Bougainville Island had attempted to secede and become independent. Its representatives reached an agreement with the national government for further decentralization, which satisfied concerns at the time.|$|E
25|$|Haslemoen {{was built}} in 1943 as a camp for conscripted labor services, serving in the Våler area. Haslemoen served in this {{capacity}} {{until the end of}} the year, when it was taken over by Luftwaffe. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> an attack on Norway and wanted to establish a reserve airport for Gardermoen, located far from the coast. Construction began in late 1943. Originally the airport was proposed to also have a water airport on the lake Gjesåssjøen, using water during summer and the ice and runway during winter.|$|E

Following the take over of Folland by Hawker Siddeley Aviation (becoming the Hamble division), further orders for 30, 20 and 41 trainers were placed between February 1960 and March 1962, receiving the designation Gnat T Mk. 1.

Although ABC had approved of a pilot film, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> how audiences would accept three women fighting crime on their own. ABC executives brought in David Ogden Stiers as Scott Woodville, who would act as the chief back-up to the Angels and Bosley's superior; he would also be depicted as the organizer of the plan, in similar fashion to Jim Phelps in , a series for which Goff and Roberts had written. Woodville also was the only regular known to meet Charlie face to face.|$|E
25|$|Nutraceutical Corporation, a {{supplement}} manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged {{the legality of}} the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} by the ministry in March 2004, {{it was estimated that}} the airport would have 700,000 to 800,000 passengers per year, making it the eighth largest in the country, and could have 1.3 million passengers by 2030. In a reply, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries stated that they were opposed to establishing a new airport, and that there were sufficient airports in Eastern Norway. They also said that an airport outside Avinor (the new name for the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration) would result lower profits at Gardermoen, and thus higher fees {{for the rest of the}} airports. In addition, the airlines would have higher costs having to operate to additional airports in Eastern Norway. The project was also met with local protests. In particular, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> emission into the lake, Vansjø, or alternatively to a Ramsar site in Kurefjorden, and about the local noise pollution, with the airport being located close to Moss. Natur og Ungdom were also opposed to the airport, stating that it would increase the amount of air traffic and thus result in an increase in greenhouse gases.|$|E

25|$|Some representatives mistrusted {{proposals}} to enlarge federal powers, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially {{argued that a}} bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia. Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, unlisted rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without {{a bill of rights}} and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification. The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification. James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8, 1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E
25|$|The English {{saw that}} if the revolt prospered it would inevitably attract disaffected {{supporters}} of the deposed King Richard, rumours of whose survival were widely circulating. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the potential for disaffection in Cheshire and were increasingly worried about the news from North Wales. Hotspur complained {{that he was not}} receiving sufficient support from the King and that the repressive policy of Henry was only encouraging revolt. He argued that negotiation and compromise could persuade Owain to end his revolt. In fact, as early as 1401, Hotspur may have been in secret negotiations with Owain and other leaders of the revolt to attempt to negotiate a settlement. The core Lancastrian supporters would have none of this. They struck back with anti-Welsh legislation designed to establish English dominance in Wales. The laws included prohibiting any Welshman from buying land in England, from holding any senior public office in Wales, from bearing arms, from holding any castle or defending any house, no Welsh child was to be educated or apprenticed to any trade, no Englishman could be convicted in any suit brought by a Welshman, Welshmen were to be severely penalised when marrying an Englishwoman, any Englishman marrying a Welshwoman was disenfranchised and all public assembly was forbidden. These laws sent a message to any of those who were wavering that the English viewed all the Welsh with equal suspicion. Many Welshmen who had tried to further their careers in English service now felt pushed into the rebellion as the middle ground between Owain and Henry disappeared.|$|E

The Penguins almost turned down the deal as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> giving up Cullen's playmaking and leadership abilities, while his former teammates credited Cullen as being the primary reason they were in a playoff position at the time the trade happened.

That year, SR 125 was truncated to begin at SR 905 by the Legislature, as the latter was formed as a route from I-5 to the border. In 1988, work was under way to add lanes to SR 125 from south of Lemon Avenue to the northern terminus, {{at a cost of}} $17.2 million. The next year, some Bonita residents raised objections about the proposed extension south of La Mesa, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> additional congestion and urbanization from the freeway going through Bonita.|$|E
500|$|Oxford United's {{board of}} {{directors}} unanimously supported Maxwell's proposed amalgamation at a board meeting held on 20 April 1983.

The chairman of the Football League, Jack Dunnett, described Maxwell's proposal as [...] "a bold and imaginative move which I'll be watching with interest". Meanwhile, Maxwell re-entered talks with Oxford City Council over local stadium sites, repeating his preference for the Marston location. The council again refused. The mayor of Didcot, a small town about halfway between Oxford and Reading, suggested that Thames Valley Royals could build a ground there, on a site {{that had already been}} picked out for non-League amateurs Didcot Town. Wallingford, a similar proposition just east of Didcot, was also proposed. The residents of neither Didcot nor Wallingford showed much interest in hosting Thames Valley Royals home matches, partly because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> football hooliganism.|$|E
