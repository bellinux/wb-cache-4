40|$|In the general, {{most of the}} {{companies}} {{on the field of}} metal cutting focus on the automation of the workpiece handling at the machine tools. This trend was supported by the development of new methods for the exchange and the buffering of workpieces. On the one hand, there are the goals of increasing productivity and growing flexibility which finally lead to lower overall production costs. This can be achieved by operations which are parallel to the essential operating time, for example setup operations. On the other hand, the transport, the storage and retrieval, and the handling of the tools can be improved by the use of standardized <b>tool</b> <b>carriers</b> (e. g. <b>tool</b> pallets). The latter aspect is a starting point for new concepts in tool logistics...|$|R

50|$|Due to this smart {{arrangement}} of the wires, {{it is possible to}} avoid changes in the wire length during rounding. When using the needle winding technique, it is quite common to wind multiple toothed chains simultaneously. This happens mainly on <b>carrier</b> <b>tools</b> or workpiece <b>carriers</b> that are positioned inside the needle winding machine. Due {{to the fact that the}} phases U, V and W as well as multiple stators can be wound at the same time, the needle winding technique has a high performance density in connection with the use of toothed chains.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} issue accoutrement today, {{dependent upon}} the branch of service, was changed to the capacity of two front pouches (Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.) instead of one. To this, privately purchased water bottle or utility pouches and hip pads are often added. The entrenching <b>tool</b> pouch (<b>Carrier,</b> Entrenching <b>Tool</b> Case, DPM, IRR.) is sometimes used as an alternative water bottle pouch.|$|R
50|$|As {{a native}} MPLS derivative, T-MPLS {{can be easily}} {{implemented}} over existing MPLS routers. However, T-MPLS has been stripped of the characteristics which originally made it attractive to carriers—control-plane automation, signaling, and QoS—and therefore has yet to prove its benefits for the transport network. T-MPLS OAM, defined in ITU Y.1711, is different from MPLS OAM and lacks powerful management <b>tools</b> that <b>carriers</b> typically expect. T MPLS was abandoned by the ITU-T in favor of MPLS-TP in December 2008.|$|R
50|$|A Lite-Trac crop sprayer, or liquid {{fertiliser}} applicator, mounts onto the SS2400 <b>Tool</b> <b>Carrier</b> centrally between both axles to maintain equal weight distribution {{on all four}} wheels and a low centre of gravity whether empty or full. The stainless steel tanks are manufactured in capacities of up to 8,000 litres, whilst Pommier aluminium booms of up to 48 meters can be fitted, making these Europe’s largest four-wheeled self-propelled sprayers.|$|E
50|$|Lite-Trac {{had existed}} as a name since before 2006, with first prototypes built in 2004. Following {{the success of}} initial testing, Lite-Trac was {{incorporated}} in 2008 to develop and manufacture the SS2400 <b>Tool</b> <b>Carrier</b> with its patented chassis layout. Since then Lite-Trac {{has gone on to}} develop its own crop sprayers which exploit the potential of the SS2400 chassis and has branched out into spreading and granular application.|$|E
50|$|The linear <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> (y-axis) {{has several}} {{stations}} {{that hold the}} punching tools and one cutting tool. Especially for flexibility and efficient processing are setup times a crucial cost factor. Downtimes should {{be reduced to a}} minimum. Therefore, recent tool systems are designed for fast and convenient change of punches and dies. They are equipped with a special plug-in system for a quick and easy change of tools.|$|E
40|$|Field {{operations}} in Alfisols and related soils require timeliness and precision {{for the early}} establishment of a crop in the rainy season. Animal-drawn, multipurpose wheeled <b>tool</b> <b>carriers</b> (WTCs) {{have been found to}} be the most appropriate machinery for this purpose. Three designs discussed in this paper covered 1 ha in 3 - 4 hours for different tillage operations, and could be drawn by a pair of oxen of average size. A WTC fitted with a planter-and-fertilizer applicator, consisting of an inclined plate for seed metering and 1416 oscillating mechanisms for fertilizer metering and a double-shoe furrow opener, gave excellent results in sowing various crops, and covered 1 ha in 4 - 5 hours with an average draft of 1530 N (156 kgf) for four rows. A rolling crust breaker, developed to enhance seedling emergence through the surface crust, gave good results. Intensive primary tillage of Alfisols showed advantages in the early stages of crop growth, but they tended to disappear late in the season. Results of tillage studies conducted for 4 years indicate a need for further research to find out the comparative advantages of different intensities of primary tillage during the cropping season and off-season...|$|R

40|$|This paper delineates the micro-watershed based {{technology}} conceived, {{designed and}} developed by ICRISAT and reviews its performance at ICRISAT Centre and in farmers' fields. The earlier results are viewed retrospectively and lessons drawn for solving the difficult problem of spread {{of this technology}} in dryland regions of India. ICRISAT has assembled a watershed based technology for dependable rainfall areas of the semi-arid tropics regions of India. The long-term experiments at ICRISAT Centre confirmed that the application of improved technology results in considerable improvements in yields and profitability. The on-farm watershed trials in a few agro-climates of the Indian semi-arid tropics with moderate but dependable rainfall showed that gross profits from improved technology were 1. 5 - 2 times higher than those from the traditional technology as long as management support and adequate inputs were made available. The experience shows that the continuing need for management support for watershed development, credit supply, wheeled <b>tool</b> <b>carriers,</b> infrastructure facilities for supply of seeds, fertilizers and the need of farmer's participation and their training {{are some of the}} constraints which seem to impose narrower limits on the technology spread than had earlier been anticipated. The lessons learned from these experiences suggest that these barriers can be removed by close cooperation of researchers, administrators, extension workers and bankers with active participation of the farmers in order to realize the full potential of the watershed based technology. ...|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{hydraulic}} excavator capabilities have expanded far beyond excavation tasks. With {{the advent of}} hydraulic powered attachments such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, actually serves as an effective <b>tool</b> <b>carrier.</b> Many excavators feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite.|$|E

On Apollo 12, 13, and 14, the second subpackage also stored the Lunar Hand <b>Tool</b> <b>Carrier</b> (HTC). The exact deployment of experiments differed by mission. The following pictures show a typical procedure from Apollo 12.|$|E
50|$|The design effort went slowly, {{due to the}} {{concentration}} on the design and development of items to meet the requirement of the Vietnam War, although developers initiated projects investigating the feasibility of replacing much of the steel and brass hardware with aluminum or plastic items. On 15 March 1967, an Engineering Concept Review was held at Natick Laboratories. The concept approved at the meeting was for an individual equipment belt to be supported by individual equipment suspenders, to which could be attached component items such as small arms ammunition cases, water canteen covers, entrenching <b>tool</b> <b>carriers,</b> field first aid dressing cases, etc. A field pack somewhat larger than the M-1961 cotton canvas duck field pack was proposed which could be attached for carrying either on the individual equipment belt at the small of the back, or on the shoulders attached to the individual equipment belt suspenders, or attached to a detachable field pack frame. The field pack frame with shoulder straps and a removable cargo shelf would be designed to be worn over the individual equipment belt and suspenders. The end result of this meeting was {{the adoption of the}} nylon M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE). The field pack design was rejected in the end and a nylon version of the M-1961 field pack was produced instead along with the nylon Tropical Rucksack (FSN 8465-935-6673).|$|R

5000|$|Bean {{had planned}} on using a {{self-timer}} for his Hasselblad camera {{in order to}} take a photograph of both himself and Pete Conrad while on the lunar surface near the Surveyor III spacecraft. Bean was hoping not only to record a wonderful photo, but also to confuse the scientists back home on how the photo could have been taken. However, neither he nor Conrad could locate the timer in the <b>tool</b> <b>carrier</b> tote bag while at the Surveyor III site and thus lost the opportunity. Bean did not locate the self-timer until {{the very end of the}} EVA when it was too late to use - at which point Bean threw it as hard as he could. Bean’s paintings of what this photo would have looked like (titled [...] "The Fabulous Photo We Never Took") and one of his fruitless search for the timer ("Our Little Secret") are included in his collection of Apollo paintings.|$|E
