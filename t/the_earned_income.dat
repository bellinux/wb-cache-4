25|$|While {{offering}} {{income tax}} deductions {{has been the}} preferred method of providing tax incentives, some commentators have expressed concern that these incentives provide disproportionate benefits to wealthier donors.

Additional tax favored approaches have been proposed for organ donation, including providing: tax credits {{to the families of}} deceased donors (seeking to encourage consent), refundable tax credits (similar to <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> credit) to provide greater tax equity among potential donors, and charitable deductions for the donation of blood or organs.|$|E

500|$|In the Senate, Bradley {{acquired}} {{a reputation for}} being somewhat aloof and was thought of as a [...] "policy wonk", specializing in complex reform initiatives. Among these was the 1986 overhaul of the federal tax code, co-sponsored with Dick Gephardt, which reduced the tax rate schedule to just two brackets, 15 percent and 28 percent, and eliminated many kinds of deductions. Domestic policy initiatives that Bradley led or was associated with included reform of child support enforcement; legislation concerning lead-related children's health problems; <b>the</b> <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Credit; campaign finance reform; a re-apportioning of California water rights; and federal budget reform to reduce the deficit, which included, in 1981, supporting Reagan's spending cuts but opposing his parallel tax cut package, one of only three senators to take this position. He sponsored the Freedom Support Act, an exchange program between the republics of the former Soviet Union and the United States.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{utilization of}} a state <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> credit by AFDC and TANF recipients. Although utilization percentages are increasing, we find that among TANF recipients in 1999, 45. 7 percent of all households and 34. 8 percent of eligible households did not receive <b>the</b> state <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> credit. Moreover, we find that utilization may depend upon TANF requirements and incentives, information resources, and barriers to work and filing of income tax returns. Finally, we investigate whether low utilization is because of little or no benefit from <b>the</b> state <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> credit and find this may be true for some with barriers or less incentive to work under TANF. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, the [...] (EITC or EIC) is {{a credit}} {{for people who}} earn low-to-moderate incomes.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Credit is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States.

2500|$|In the United States, {{earned income}} tax credit rates, also known as EITC or EIC, vary by state—some are {{refundable}} while other states do not allow a refundable tax credit. The federal EITC program has been expanded by a number of presidents including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. In 1986, President Reagan described the EITC as [...] "the best anti poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress." [...] The ability of <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> tax credit to deliver larger monetary benefits to the poor workers than an {{increase in the minimum wage}} and at a lower cost to society was documented in a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office.|$|E

2500|$|A {{refundable}} {{tax credit}} is a mechanism whereby {{the tax system}} can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> tax credit and the additional child tax credit in the US, and working tax credits and child tax credits in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax, in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income. [...] This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, {{proposed}} a tax plan which, according to The Wall Street Journal, combined thinking from [...] "old-fashioned, Reagan-era supply siders" [...] and a [...] "breed of largely younger conservative reform thinkers" [...] {{who are concerned}} with the tax burden on the middle-class. [...] The plan would lower the top corporate income tax rate from 38% to 25%, eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, and create a new child tax credit worth up to $2,500 per child. [...] The plan would set the top individual income tax rate at 35%. It also included a proposal to replace the means-tested welfare system, including food stamps and <b>the</b> <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Credit, with a new [...] "consolidated system of benefits".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{during the}} late 1940s and 1950s, the entire {{political}} and cultural elite of Leningrad suffered from more harsh repressions under dictatorship of Stalin, hundreds were executed and thousands were imprisoned in repressions known as the Leningrad Affair. Independent thinkers, writers, artists and other intellectuals were attacked, magazines [...] "Zvezda" [...] and [...] "Leningrad" [...] were banned, Akhmatova and Zoshchenko were repressed, {{and tens of thousands}} Leningraders were exiled to Siberia. More crackdowns on the Leningrad's intellectual elite, known as the [...] "Second Leningrad affair", were part of unfair economic policies of the Soviet state. Leningrad's economy was producing about 6% of the USSR GNP, having less than 2% of the country's population, but such economic efficiency was negated by the Soviet Communist Party which diverted <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> from people of Leningrad to other Soviet places and programs. As a result, during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the city of Leningrad was seriously underfunded in favor of Moscow. Leningrad suffered from the unfair distribution of wealth, because the Soviet leadership drained the city's resources to subsidise higher standards of living in Moscow and some underperforming parts of the Soviet Union and beyond. Such unfair redistribution of wealth caused struggle within the Soviet government and communist party, which led to their fragmentation and {{played a role in the}} eventual collapse of the USSR.|$|E

30|$|The {{evidence}} {{showed that}} <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Credit (EITC), aside from achieving its distributional goals, was more effective at increasing employment among affected groups and overall (Dickert-Conlin and Holtz-Eakin 2000). <b>The</b> U.S. <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Credit (EITC) provides a refundable income tax credit to workers with earnings below a certain threshold. In what {{is probably the best}} evaluation of that program to date, Hotz et al. (2006) examined the impact of a substantial liberalization of the EITC during the period 1991 – 2000 for welfare recipients with two or more children. They found that the 3.4 percent increase in disposable income attributable to the EITC led to a 5.6 percent increase in employment in this group.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to reiterate {{that in order to}} take advantage of the housing exclusion, the housing amount must be paid for by employer-provided amounts or incurred from maintaining a qualified second foreign household. Secondly, if housing amounts are to be excluded, this must be calculated first before <b>the</b> foreign <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> exclusion can be determined. In other words, the housing amount must be deducted from <b>the</b> total foreign <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> to arrive at the excludable amount for foreign <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> exclusion purposes. Lastly, to choose the housing exclusion, Form 2555 is the only form allowed and must be completely filled out. Form 2555-EZ cannot be used to claim the foreign housing exclusion.|$|R
