It stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña as Brian Taylor and Miguel Zavala, two Los Angeles Police Department officers who work in South Los Angeles. The film focuses on their day-to-day police work, <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> a certain group of gang members, their friendship with each other, and their personal relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} prompted Pakistan {{to ask the}} two Australian {{players to}} appear {{in front of their}} own judicial inquiry into corruption; Australia responded by granting the Pakistanis permission to hold hearings in Australia with full privileges. The players were questioned about their accusations against Malik, and whether <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> John detracted from their credibility. Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.|$|E
5|$|Either Ælfric or his {{predecessor}} Sigeric {{wrote a letter}} to Wulfsige, Bishop of Sherborne about the duties of bishops {{to make sure that the}} laity did not despoil churches. The letter also urged Wulfsige to exhort the laity to strive for justice in <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> others, help widows and orphans, not fight, as well as other moral precepts. Ælfric also ordered the composition of the first Life of Dunstan, a hagiography, or saint's life, of Dunstan, a predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury. He also acted as a royal judge, once being ordered by King Æthelred to adjudicate a case between thegns, or local noblemen.|$|E

50|$|For {{the correct}} {{understanding}} of what the sacred author wanted to assert, due attention must be paid to the customary and characteristic styles of feeling, speaking and narrating which prevailed {{at the time of the}} sacred writer, and to the patterns men normally employed at that period in <b>their</b> everyday <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> one another.|$|R
5|$|During <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the Nausets {{over the}} release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of {{troubles}} that Massasoit was experiencing. Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by Corbitant, sachem of the Narragansett tribe. A party of ten men {{under the leadership of}} Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.|$|E
5|$|To this end, Stalin and Molotov {{strung out}} the {{negotiations}} with the Japanese, giving them false hope of a Soviet-mediated peace. At the same time, in <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the United States and Britain, the Soviets insisted on strict adherence to the Cairo Declaration, re-affirmed at the Yalta Conference, that the Allies would not accept separate or conditional peace with Japan. The Japanese would have to surrender unconditionally to all the Allies. To prolong the war, the Soviets opposed any attempt to weaken this requirement. This would give the Soviets time to complete the transfer of their troops from the Western Front to the Far East, and conquer Manchuria (Manchukuo), Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang), Korea, South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, and possibly, Hokkaidō (starting with a landing at Rumoi).|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{development}} of international trade, the elementary principles of credit and banking were developed. Both Jewish and Italian merchants had regular banking agents in Syria, who transacted business {{on behalf of their}} masters. Bills of exchange were also used by them in <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> one another and money was deposited in various banking centers throughout Syria. The encouragement of trade and industry provided the Ayyubid sultans with the funds needed for military expenditure as well as for developmental and everyday lifestyle works. Special attention was made to the economic state of the empire under al-Adil and al-Kamil. The latter maintained a strict control over expenditure; it is said that on his death he left a treasury which was equivalent to the budget of one full year.|$|E
50|$|John 9 is {{the ninth}} {{chapter of the}} Gospel of John in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It records the healing {{of a man who}} had been blind from birth, a miracle {{performed}} by Jesus, and <b>their</b> subsequent <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the Pharisees. The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that John composed this Gospel.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s, {{corruption}} {{was a way}} of life in Hong Kong, {{being the}} norm in all government departments. Policemen would often extract bribes (popularly called [...] "tea fee") before they investigated a crime, as did firemen before they rescued people and put out fires. Many Chinese detective superintendents amassed incredible wealth from <b>their</b> corrupt <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> triads and corporations. Their names have been seared into the memories of the older generations, their stories adapted into several popular movies such as To be Number One (跛豪) in 1991. That is not to say British officers were entirely clean in <b>their</b> <b>dealings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The KIO {{collects}} {{taxes at}} border crossings with China and engages in various business deals throughout Kachin State, often {{related to the}} exploitation of natural resources such as jade, timber and gold. Some of the KIO's senior leadership {{have a reputation for}} corruption because of <b>their</b> business <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the Burmese military junta. They were junta's spy for years, helping to place military camp all over Kachin State.|$|R
5|$|In 1636 {{the boat}} of Massachusetts trader John Oldham was seen {{anchored}} off Block Island, swarming with Indians. The Indians fled at {{the approach of}} the investigating colonists, and Oldham's body was found below the main deck. The attackers were at the time believed to be from tribes affiliated with the Narragansetts, but Narragansett leaders claimed that those responsible had fled to the protection of the Pequots. At the time the Pequots were aggressively expansionist in <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the surrounding native tribes (including the Narragansett), but had generally kept the peace with the English colonists of present-day southern New England. The accusation of the Narraganssetts angered Massachusetts authorities (then under governor Henry Vane), who were already upset that the Pequots had earlier failed to turn over men implicated in killing another trader on the Connecticut River. This second perceived affront produced calls in Massachusetts for action against the Pequots. In August 1636 Governor Vane placed Endecott {{at the head of a}} 90-man force to extract justice from the Pequots.|$|E

After Moebius {{returned}} to France, and Starwatcher Graphics was disbanded in 2000, the Lofficiers started their own company, Hollywood Comics, which advises and counsels comic book professionals in <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Hollywood. Jean-Marc and Randy moved to Chalabre, in the South of France, in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The charter was {{incomplete}} for the Plymouth Council for New England {{when the}} colonists departed England (it was granted {{while they were}} in transit on November 3/November 13). They arrived without a patent; the older Wincob patent was from <b>their</b> abandoned <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the London Company. Some of the passengers, aware of the situation, suggested that they were free to do as they chose upon landing, without a patent in place, and to ignore the contract with the investors.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>their</b> early <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the British {{government}} {{were inclined to}} turbulence, and they were involvedin the Miranzai expeditions of 1851 and 1855, the only expedition specially sent against them was the Kurram expedition of 1856. After this they settled down and engaged in trade. During the Second Afghan War they supplied Sir Frederick Roberts with guides and provisions. In 1892 they voluntarily accepted British administration and furnished {{a large part of}} the tribal militia in the Kurram Valley.|$|R

25|$|Capello's {{link with}} United {{eventually}} came to nothing after Ferguson abandoned {{his decision to}} retire and signed a new contract, with Martin Edwards claiming that United had been {{three or four days}} away from appointing a new manager, believed to be Capello, when Ferguson changed his mind. The 2001–02 season developed into a battle between Roma and Juventus. After a heated encounter between the teams, Capello used an interview to criticise the Moggi family that ran Juventus, particularly <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> players agents.|$|E
25|$|The Bibo {{brothers}} developed reputations for {{fairness in}} <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the local Native Americans: they would sell the tribes' produce through their stores and supply US Army forts under contracts; in turn the Native Americans received fair prices and improved their farming techniques. The brothers also mediated land disputes between the tribes and the Mexican residents, and {{also tried to}} prevent Anglo-Americans from purchasing Indian land at below market prices; such stances did not endear them to these groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Cornwall {{are involved in}} the manufacture of tin ingots. They mine the ore, smelt it and then work it into pieces the shape of knuckle-bones, after which it is transported to the island of Ictis by wagon, which can be done at low tide. Merchants purchasing it there pack it on horses for 30days to the river Rhône, where it is carried down to the mouth. Diodorus says that the {{inhabitants of}} Cornwall are civilised in manner and especially hospitable to strangers because of <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> foreign merchants.|$|E
5000|$|Moore {{has been}} termed [...] "a cross between Virginia Woolf and Djuna Barnes, {{but with a}} more biting wit." [...] Her novels make free use of modernist {{techniques}} such as stream of consciousness in <b>their</b> frank <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> issues of sexuality and disability. Though considered a highly talented experimental writer, Moore's disappearance (and the rarity of published versions of her texts until the mid-1990s) {{has led to a}} relative critical neglect of her work, until recently.|$|R
40|$|This study {{collated}} {{responses from}} {{a survey of}} over 2, 100 businesses across Australia to assess the extent of both <b>their</b> business <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> China and <b>their</b> commercial interest in Intellectual Property (IP). We found that 9 % of firms had business <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> China but since these are disproportionately large firms, they accounted for 40 % of business sales in Australia. Among these businesses, IP issues (registration, examination and enforcement) are of less concern than Chinese regulations and legal transparency. Among the IP issues covered in the survey, IP enforcement poses the greatest problem for Australian businesses...|$|R

25|$|The {{extension}} of the town along the former lane to Easebourne towards the new mansion, which had begun in the early 14th century with {{the building of the}} first mansion on the river-side site, now intensified. This contributed to the economic expansion, as merchants built new houses and shops on North Street to facilitate <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Cowdray House. It was during this period that the Angel Hotel was built, as a coaching house in response to the growing travel. Fifty years later it hosted many of the Pilgrim Fathers, on their way from London and East Anglia to Plymouth.|$|E
25|$|Lesbian {{feminism}} typically situates {{the state}} of being a lesbian {{as a form of}} resistance to patriarchal institutions. Sexual orientation is posited here as a choice, or at least a conscious response to a situation. It is also seen as a critique of male supremacy, chauvinism, and masculinity in general. Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and dialogue about women's relationships, and typically limits <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> men.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia. Unable to establish diplomatic contacts with the Tibetan government, and concerned about reports of <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Russia, in 1903-04, a British expedition led by Colonel Francis Younghusband was sent to Lhasa to force a trading agreement and to prevent Tibetans from establishing a relationship with the Russians. In response, the Qing foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of such a claim. Before the British troops arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then went to Beijing in 1908.|$|E
50|$|Stephenson, {{having come}} from the North, spoke with a broad Northumberland accent and not the 'Language of Parliament,' which made him seem lowly. Realizing this, he {{made a point of}} educating his son Robert in a private school, where he was taught the {{sciences}} his father lacked, and so learnt to speak with a correct vocabulary and accent. It was due to this, in <b>their</b> future <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Parliament, that {{it became clear that the}} authorities preferred Robert to his father.|$|R

60|$|The {{habits of}} traffic engendered at the {{cataracts}} of the Columbia, {{have had their}} influence along the coast. The Chinooks and other Indians {{at the mouth of}} the river, soon proved themselves keen traders, and in <b>their</b> early <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the Astorians never hesitated to ask three times what they considered the real value of an article. They were inquisitive, also, in the extreme, and impertinently intrusive; and were prone to indulge in scoffing and ridicule at the expense of the strangers.|$|R
25|$|He was an Indian {{with a white}} man's {{spirit of}} hatred and revenge {{for those who had}} wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe {{gradually}} driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of subjection, should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Druze in Lebanon {{managed to}} {{maintain}} for centuries a small, hardy {{community in the}} Chouf Mountains overlooking Beirut surrounded by a sea of potential enemies, both Christian and Muslim, {{and they have a}} reputation of being savage fighters known for their tenacious battle spirit. Their esprit de corps and brutal methods often convinced their opponents to flee, whilst those who decided to stay and fight never lived to tell the tale. However, the Lebanese Druze have also been amiable to whoever controls the Chouf region at any given time, and they were pragmatic with <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> foreign powers such as the Israelis, Americans and Syrians.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira {{did not see}} eye to {{eye with}} his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho also saw many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had a great interest in Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or <b>their</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the shogunate.|$|E
5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been so eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information.
