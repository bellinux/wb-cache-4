40|$|The essay {{deals with}} <b>translations</b> during {{educational}} <b>activities.</b> <b>Translations</b> {{are important because}} children display a strongly differentiated competence in understanding and speaking English as a lingua franca. In villages, adults’ translations are frequently instrumental to the achievement of assigned tasks, while promotion of children’s active participation is scarce. Consequently, translations are often adults’ disempowering monologues and, during their <b>translation</b> <b>activity,</b> adults tend to strategically reduce renditions of translated turns and to avoid possible conflicts. Nevertheless, during the <b>translation</b> <b>activity,</b> dyadic interactions in the first language {{may be useful in}} promoting children’s active participation, and adults may also highlight the possibility to change decisions and reopen discussions. Finally, dialogic mediation seems to be more likely in adolescents’ occasional translations for their mates in summer camps...|$|R

Skopos theory highlights the importance of ‘purpose’ of translating as one of the determining factors in defining the way translating is carried out (end justifies the means (Nord, 2001)).

We find that the 30 S P site is generally more tolerant of mutation than the 30 S A site. In the A site, A 1493 C or any substitution of G 530 or A 1492 results in complete loss of <b>translation</b> <b>activity,</b> while A 1493 U and A 1493 G decrease <b>translation</b> <b>activity</b> by > 20 -fold.

Moreover, several sets of multiple substitutions within the 30 S P site fail to inactivate the ribosome. The robust nature of the 30 S P site indicates that its interaction with the codon–anticodon helix is less stringent than that of the 30 S A site. In addition, we show that G 1338 A suppresses phenotypes conferred by m 2 G 966 A and several multiple P-site substitutions, suggesting that adenine at position 1338 can stabilize tRNA interaction in the P site...|$|R

50|$|Missionary {{translation}} {{was divided}} into two categories: one, secular texts—translated texts of Indian literature, textbooks for school curricula, government regulations and circulars; two, religious texts—translations of English and Bengali tracts, Christian literary allegories, and the translation of gospel and Bible. James Peggs initially, Amos Sutton and others later, started their education mission by writing secular texts such as dictionaries and grammars—the volume of writing was so large that it necessitated a separate printing press at Cuttack in 1837; however, prior to Cuttack printing press, <b>translation</b> <b>activities</b> were performed and published from Serampore Mission press. Missionaries were installed by East India Company as mediators between Company administrators and native Oriyas.

5000|$|Though {{the name}} of the book [...] "Oktoich" [...] derived from the Greek name Octoechos (Old Slavonic [...] "Osmoglasnik," [...] because [...] "glas" [...] is the Slavonic term for echos), the Slavic book did rather {{correspond}} to the unnotated Tropologion, and often it included the hymns of the Irmolog as well. The Slavic reception, although it can be regarded as faithful translation of the Byzantine books, is mainly based on early Theta notation, which was used by Slavic reformers in order to develop own forms of notation in Moscow and Novgorod (znamenny chant). The <b>translation</b> <b>activities</b> between 1062 and 1074 at the Kievan Pechersky monastery had been realised without the help of South Slavic translators. The earliest known Slavonic manuscripts with neumes date from the late 11th or 12th century (mainly Stichirar, Kondakar and Irmolog). Concerning the earlier translations of the hymns and later translations in Russia, we can observe two different approaches to translation, one which favours the musical and metrical structure and another which favours the literal translation of the hymns. The school represented by Kliment of Ohrid, Naum, or Constantine of Preslav endeavoured to match the Greek text in the number of syllables in the hymns and to preserve the verse structure indicated by the corresponding neumes, but the resulting meaning of the hymns could change so considerably that, in certain cases, the only aspect the original and the translation had in common was the prescribed music, i.e., the indicated melos and echos. On the other hand, the later translations during the missions in Russia had their emphasis on a literal translation of the texts, but this resulted in altering the metrical structure given by the avtomela and the heirmoi so much that the music had to be recomposed.|$|E

Also in the Oyun are extracts from a Kitāb al-tāj [...] Ebn al-Nadim describes this book as a biography of Khosrau I (Anoshirvan), but Ibn Qutayba’s extracts mostly pertain to Khosrau II (Parviz) and suggest a mirror for princes.

Underlying the emergence of knowledge translation is a belief that new research findings will increase the efficiency of the present health care system, decrease the inequitable distribution of negative health outcomes, and improve the health of individuals. One growing population that faces increased risk of negative health outcomes in Canada, and Saskatoon, is street-involved youth. The purpose of this qualitative case study is to understand how the organizational context of a national surveillance study targeting street-involved youth, the Enhanced Street Youth Study, influences knowledge <b>translation</b> <b>activities</b> in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This case study traces the history of knowledge translation related to the surveillances study, and describes and analyzes the knowledge <b>translation</b> <b>activities</b> that took place in early 2011. Informed by document analysis, interviews, and participant observation, this study captures the perspectives and opinions of representatives from the key organizational and individual stakeholders: the Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Services of the Saskatoon Health Region, local community agencies, and street-involved youth.

40|$|Facilitated by {{technologies}} enabling a {{large number}} of networked individuals to collaborate voluntarily on translation tasks, translation crowdsourcing isa new translation procurement model which relies on crowds of Internet users willing to engage in <b>translation</b> <b>activity</b> at the request of a company or organisation. Taking the case of Facebook translation, with specific reference to the community of Polish Facebook user-translators, this study seeks to understandthe motivation underpinning contributions that are typically without financial reward, especially when the call for translation is made by a for-profit entity. A mixed methods research design involving netnography, online surveys and an observational study with elements of remote usability testing and contextual inquiry was incorporated to collect the data on the community of contributors, their <b>translation</b> <b>activity</b> and use of the Facebook collaborative translation platform. The analysis of the data suggests that the Polish Facebook user translators are motivated by a number of factors, both personal as well as social, which primarily contribute to the satisfaction of their needs of competence, autonomy and relatedness. The studied user-translators perceived the Facebook initiative as an opportunity to practice skills and effect change for the better while collaborating with others and experiencing fun. However, the flaws and limitations inherent in the purpose-built Facebook collaborative translation platform frequently prevented the <b>translation</b> <b>activity</b> on Facebook from being carried out as intended. This was found to undermine the satisfaction of needs and thus negatively affect the user-translators’ motivation. Based on these findings, the study characterises the motivations of user-translators in translation crowdsourcing in for-profit contexts and explains how motivation to contribute is affected by the translation platforms provided for the purpose. A set of guidelines for the design of such platforms is offered to organisers of translation crowdsourcing initiatives for consideration in future.
