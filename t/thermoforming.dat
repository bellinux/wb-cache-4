25|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (sometimes written poly(ethylene terephthalate)), commonly abbreviated PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is {{the most}} common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in fibres for clothing, containers for liquids and foods, <b>thermoforming</b> for manufacturing, and in combination with glass fibre for engineering resins.|$|E
25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as <b>thermoforming,</b> {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, diethylene glycol (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.|$|E

40|$|Ultra-lightweight <b>thermoformed</b> {{stiffened}} {{structures are}} {{emerging as a}} viable option for spacecraft applications due to their advantage over inflatable structures. Although pressurization {{may be used for}} deployment, constant pressure is not required to maintain stiffness. However, <b>thermoformed</b> stiffening features are often locally nonlinear in their behavior under loading. This thesis has three aspects: 1) to understand stiffness properties of a <b>thermoformed</b> stiffened ultra-lightweight panel, 2) to develop finite element models using a phasedverification approach and 3) to verify panel response to dynamic loading. This thesis demonstrates that conventional static and dynamic testing principles can be applied to test ultra-lightweight <b>thermoformed</b> stiffened structures. Another contribution of this thesis is by evaluating the stiffness properties of different stiffener configurations. Finally, the procedure used in this thesis could be adapted in the study of similar ultra-lightweight <b>thermoformed</b> stiffened spacecraft structures...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Despite a very {{significant}} increase in the use of <b>thermoform</b> retainers, within orthodontics, to date, there is no evidence regarding the quality of fit between the dental cast and retainer. The current study aims to compare the fit of different <b>thermoform</b> retainer materials, under laboratory standardized conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, laboratory-based study design was adopted to compare the fit of four different commercially available <b>thermoform</b> retainer materials. A master dental cast was fabricated in dental stone, to which three and five specific reference points were located on the central incisors and upper first molars, respectively. The master cast was then duplicated to produce a total of 40 such dental casts. The performance of the following four test materials was investigated: ACE, C+ (Raintree Essix Glenroe), True Tain (True Tain Inc.), and Iconic Clear (DB Orthodontics). For each material, 10 <b>thermoform</b> retainers were fabricated within the dental laboratory. Subsequent scanning and analysing of the casts and <b>thermoform</b> retainers was performed in a dedicated area, using the co-ordinate measuring machine, in order to calculate their respective fit at the incisor and first molar regions. RESULTS: At all eight recorded landmark points, the mean values for the following <b>thermoform</b> materials: ACE, True Tain, and Iconic Clear, a similar trend was observed. At all eight points, {{there was a significant difference}} between the performance of the four different materials (P < 0. 001), with the greatest difference observed in the mean values in relation to material C+. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant differences were observed in the fit behaviour of all four <b>thermoform</b> materials being tested...|$|R

50|$|<b>Thermoforming</b> {{differs from}} {{injection}} molding, blow molding, rotational molding {{and other forms}} of processing plastics. Thin-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> is primarily the manufacture of disposable cups, containers, lids, trays, blisters, clamshells, and other products for the food, medical, and general retail industries. Thick-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> includes parts as diverse as vehicle door and dash panels, refrigerator liners, utility vehicle beds, and plastic pallets.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} <b>thermoforming</b> process categories. Sheet {{thickness}} less than 1.5 mm (0.060 inches) is usually {{delivered to the}} <b>thermoforming</b> machine from rolls or from a sheet extruder. Thin-gauge roll-fed or inline extruded <b>thermoforming</b> applications are dominated by rigid or semi-rigid disposable packaging. Sheet thicknesses greater than 3 mm (0.120 inches) are usually delivered to the forming machine by hand or an auto-feed method already cut to final dimensions. Heavy, or thick-gauge, cut sheet <b>thermoforming</b> applications are primarily used as permanent structural components. There is {{a small but growing}} medium-gauge market that forms sheet 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness.|$|E
50|$|An {{integral}} part of the <b>thermoforming</b> process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge <b>thermoforming</b> also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated <b>thermoforming</b> machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large <b>thermoforming</b> manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|E
50|$|The microthermoforming process {{including}} its products {{can have all}} the advantageous properties of the powerful macroscopic production process. Moreover, the <b>thermoformed</b> microparts have additional, specific properties appearing only in microscale dimensions and resulting from their unusual morphology. <b>Thermoformed</b> e.g. microfluidic structures have free standing microcavities such as channels and reservoirs and they are thin walled partly {{in the range of}} a few micrometers. Specific properties of <b>thermoformed</b> microparts are, amongst others, their high flexibility, their small volume and mass, their low thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their low light absorbance and background fluorescence. Morphology and properties of these microparts now can result in improved or even new, so far unthought of applications.|$|R
