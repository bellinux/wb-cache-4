50|$|Establishing a {{moisture}} balance {{beneficial to the}} wound bed is another prerequisite of care. The natural response to injury is inflammation typified by the local expression of histamine and bradykinin and leading to vasodilation of the vessels that are in relative {{close proximity to the}} site of injury. As serum based fluid moves out of the vessels into the interstitial spaces the resultant soft <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> manifests on the wound surface as exudate. In the chronic wound this exudate contains a surfeit of proteolytic enzymes and other components not seen in acute wounds and these compounds have a corrosive effect on the wound bed and surrounding peri-wound skin. The application of dressings, topical negative pressure, compression garments and leg elevation/exercise have been identified as methods for management of wound exudate.|$|E

40|$|Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) {{is caused}} by endothelial and subendothelial damage by neutrophil-derived oxidants. Vitamin C is an {{antioxidant}} which attenuates endothelial injury after IRI. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of oral vitamin C {{in the prevention of}} IRI in skeletal muscle. We used a model of cross-clamping (3 hours) and reperfusion (1 hour) of the cremaster muscle in rats. Muscle function was assessed electrophysiologically by electrical field stimulation. Infiltration by neutrophils was determined by the activity of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) and <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> by the wet-to-dry ratio. Neutrophil respiratory burst activity was measured in control animals and groups pretreated with vitamin C. IRI significantly decreased muscle function and increased muscle neutrophil MPO activity and muscle oedema.

Neutrophil respiratory burst activity was reduced in the group treated with vitamin C compared with the control group. We conclude that pretreatment with oral vitamin C protects against acute muscle IRI, possibly by attenuating neutrophil respiratory burst activity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
30|$|Sepsis is {{associated}} with severe vascular endothelial cell dysfunction which rapidly leads to dysregulation of normal systemic hemostasis and vascular reactivity triggering widespread <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema.</b> Although this process is considered central to the progression to organ failure during sepsis there are no therapeutic options available to treat or prevent endothelial dysfunction.

30|$|The {{cause of}} death in our cases was asphyxia. It was {{secondary}} to brain vessel occlusion in two cases, to tracheal disruption in one case and to a cervical contusion in another case. Petechiae and congestion are caused by an acute rise in venous pressure. Congestion is often associated with <b>tissue</b> swelling.

40|$|Organ {{dysfunction}} {{is a major}} clinical problem after lung transplantation. Prolonged cold ischaemia and reperfusion injury {{are believed}} to {{play a central role}} in this complication. The influence of cold preservation on subsequent warm reperfusion was studied in an isolated, ventilated and perfused rat lung. Rat lungs were flushed with cold Perfadex-solution and stored at 4 °C for different time periods. Thereafter lungs were perfused and ventilated for up to 3 h. Physiological parameters, production of inflammatory mediators and leucocyte infiltration were measured before and after perfusion. Lungs subjected to a cold ischaemia time of up to 6 h showed stable physiological conditions when perfused for 3 h. However, cold-ischaemia time beyond 6 h resulted in profound <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema,</b> thereby impairing ventilation and perfusion. Warm reperfusion and ventilation per se induced a strong inflammatory response, as demonstrated by a significant up-regulation of chemokines and adhesion molecules (cytokine-induced chemoattractant- 1, intracellular adhesion molecule and endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule), accompanied by enhanced leucocyte infiltration. Although the up-regulation of inflammatory mediators was blunted in lungs that were subjected to cold ischaemia, this did not influence leucocyte infiltration. In fact, cold ischaemia time correlated with leucocyte sequestration. Although cold preservation inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators it does not affect leucocyte sequestration during warm reperfusion. Cold preservation might cause impairment of the endothelial barrier function, as evidenced by <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> and profound leucocyte infiltration...|$|E
30|$|Radiotherapy {{leads to}} direct cell death and also damages {{microvascular}} structures leading to depletion of red marrow and proliferation of fatty marrow. After an initial phase of bone marrow oedema lasting {{just a few}} weeks, the fatty marrow conversion takes place. Soft <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> after radiotherapy is often longer lasting. Radiotherapy can lead to direct bone necrosis; usually this is incomplete and a reactive inflammatory reaction ensues. This frequently leads to sclerotic bone change of the trabeculae and cortex with reduced mechanical strength and repair capacity. This in turn makes the bone vulnerable to stress fractures [44, 45, 47].|$|E
30|$|Septic shock is a {{deleterious}} systemic {{host response}} to infection characterized by hypotension {{that is not}} reversed with fluids alone.

However, fluid responsiveness only occurs in half of critically ill patients, including patients with sepsis [3]. Fluid resuscitation is a mainstay of early treatment, but the deleterious effects of excessive fluid administration that lead to <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> are becoming clearer.|$|E
30|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in case of}} pelvic fractures after radiotherapy is usually the differentiation between a benign stress fracture and metastasis.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} create a new and less {{invasive}} experimental corrosive oesophageal burn model using a catheter without a gastric puncture (gastrotomy). Materials and Methods: We conducted the study with two groups composed of 8 male rats. The experimental oesophageal burn was established by the application of 10 % sodium hydroxide to the distal oesophagus under a pressure of 20 cmH 2 O, via 5 -F double-lumen central venous catheter without a gastrotomy. The control group was given 0. 9 % sodium chloride. All rats were killed 24 h after administration of NaOH or 0. 9 % NaCl. Histologic damage to oesophageal tissue was scored by a single pathologist blind to groups. Results: The rats in the control group were observed to have no pathological changes. Corrosive oesophagitis (<b>tissue</b> congestion, <b>oedema,</b> inflammation, ulcer and necrosis) was observed in rats exposed to NaOH. Conclusion: We believe that an experimental corrosive oesophageal burn can safely be created under same hydrostatic pressure without a gastric puncture using this model...|$|R

Neuroimaging techniques that enable us to assess baseline and task-related functions, and neurophysiological techniques that measure brain function in "real time", can be used to study the recovery of brain lesions after a stroke. In this review, we discuss important neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies of post-stroke brain reorganisation...|$|R
30|$|Specifically, the {{prolongation}} of T 1 {{relaxation time}} in AM {{is related to}} an increase in both total and relative water content in the intra- and extracellular space due to <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> and expansion of intercellular space [55]. A second phenomenon, further enhancing T 1 prolongation, is the altered electrolyte distribution in the inflamed myocardial tissue, affecting the motion of protons [56]. An initial experience published by Ferreira et al. showed excellent diagnostic performance of native T 1 mapping in the clinical setting of AM, with around 90  % overall sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy [57].|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} in arterial flow and/or pressure increases the blood {{flow through the}} microcirculation and, sometimes, this {{is accompanied by a}} significant {{increase in}} the proportion of perfused vessels [5]. This step might be impeded by microvascular failure, especially in case of sepsis [5]. Provided that microcirculation is intact, the increase in microcirculatory flow leads to an increased oxygen availability for the tissues, which might be attenuated by <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema.</b> The aerobic metabolism increases in response. Nevertheless, mitochondrial dysfunction, as it may occur during sepsis, might explain why tissue hypoxia persists in spite of increased oxygen availability [6] (Fig.  1).|$|E
30|$|Normal saline is an {{isotonic}} solution and therefore excessive fluid absorption is {{not associated with}} electrolyte disturbances. However it can result in hypervolaemia, pulmonary oedema and congestive heart failure. There is a risk of <b>tissue</b> <b>oedema</b> {{which can lead to}} poor tissue oxygenation and altered pulmonary gas function [31]. Usually these complications can be reversed with administration of diuretics. Isotonic fluids like sodium chloride used with bipolar resectoscopes may reduce complications related to electrolyte disturbances however similar principles of fluid management should be applied to all cases and the procedure terminated if excess fluid has been absorbed.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{spectroscopy}} and imaging {{have been}} used in medicine since medicine was first practised.

The reasons for the slow penetration of optical diagnostics into clinical practice are discussed. The past Spectroscopy and imaging are, and always have been, at the core of medicine and biology.

40|$|Dexamethasone palmitate was {{incorporated}} into a lipid emulsion (Intralipid, Intralipos) and was injected into rats, and its distribution in the organs and tissues and its anti-inflammatory effects were {{compared with those of}} free dexamethasone disodium phosphate. The distribution patterns of [3 H] dexamethasone were markedly different between the 2 preparations in 3 hours after intravenous administration. Dexamethasone palmitate given as a lipid emulsion showed a much higher concentration in the blood, spleen, and inflamed <b>tissues</b> (carrageenan <b>oedema),</b> whereas dexamethasone sodium phosphate had a high concentration in the muscles. The anti-inflammatory activity of both preparations given intravenously was evaluated by using the preformed carrageenan granuloma pouch method. The anti-inflammatory activity of lipid emulsion dexamethasone was 5. 6 times as potent as an equivalent amount of free dexamethasone. These results may indicate that corticosteroids which are incorporated in lipid emulsions are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system and some inflammatory cells much more than are free corticosteroids; thus they have a stronger anti-inflammatory activity. The clinical use of lipid emulsion corticosteroids for certain types of diseases is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Isolated limb {{perfusion}} {{allows the}} direct application of therapeutic agents to a tumour-bearing extremity. The present study investigated whether the dihydropyridine-type Ca 2 +-channel blocker nifedipine could improve blood flow and oxygenation status of experimental tumours during isolated limb perfusion. Perfusion {{was performed by}} cannulation of the femoral artery and vein in rats bearing DS-sarcoma on the hind foot dorsum. Perfusion rate was adjusted to maintain a perfusion pressure of 100 – 140 [*]mmHg throughout the experiment. Following equilibration, nifedipine was continuously infused for 30 [*]min (8. 3 [*]μg min− 1 [*]kg− 1 BW). During constant-pressure isolated limb perfusion, nifedipine can significantly increase perfusion rate (+ 100 %) and RBC flux (+ 60 %) through experimental leg tumours. ‘Steal phenomena’ in favour of the surrounding normal <b>tissue</b> and <b>oedema</b> formation were not observed. Despite the increased oxygen availability (+ 63 %) seen upon application of this calcium channel blocker, nifedipine does not result in a substantial reduction of tumour hypoxia, most probably due {{to an increase in}} O 2 uptake with rising O 2 supply to the tumour-bearing hind limb. Nifedipine application during isolated limb perfusion can enhance tumour microcirculation and may therefore promote the delivery (pharmacokinetics) of anti-cancer drugs to the tumour and by this improve the efficacy of pressure-controlled isolated limb perfusion...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has been widely}} used {{for the evaluation of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with only a minority of studies considering other types of arthritis. This review is concerned with an evaluation of the MRI appearance of peripheral joints in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: A Medline search was performed to identify all publications from the years 1985 to 2006 concerning MRI of the peripheral joints and PsA. Additional papers were retrieved by scanning the references to the Medline-listed articles. Articles written in English, French, German, and Italian were included. Results: Most papers studied the hand and wrist, and only few of them were concerned with the knee, foot, temporomandibular joint, and elbow. Patients with PsA showed often, but not always, a pattern of joint inflammation which extended beyond the capsule into the extraarticular <b>tissue.</b> Bone <b>oedema</b> and erosions were less frequent than in RA. In particular, bone oedema at the entheseal junction was seen, especially in the knee. The degree of synovitis, assessed by dynamic MRI, was similar in PsA and RA. Discussion: Data on MRI of the peripheral joints in PsA are scanty. Only few studies were specifically designed to evaluate the pattern of arthritis in PsA, with most information deriving from papers where different types of arthritis were considered together. An enthesis-related origin of PsA has been proposed in contrast to the primarily synovial inflammation of RA. This pathogenic interpretation is likely to be true, but does not explain all cases of PsA, and needs to be confirmed by further studies...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) is the {{key enzyme}} in {{leukotriene}} (LT) biosynthesis from arachidonic acid (AA). Here, we examined {{the role of the}} 5 -LO-product, cysteinyl-LT (Cys-LT), with a 5 -LO inhibitor (zileuton) and a Cys-LT, receptor antagonist (montelukast), in the inflammatory response and tissue injury associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). Experimental approach: SCI was induced in mice by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a two-level T 6 to T 7 laminectomy for 1 min. Cord inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring inflammatory mediators (ELISA) and apoptosis by annexin V, TUNEL, Fas ligand staining and Bax and Bcl- 2 expression (immunohistochemistry and western blots). Motor function in hindlimbs was assessed by a locomotor rating scale, for 10 days after cord injury. Key results: SCI in mice resulted in <b>tissue</b> damage, <b>oedema,</b> neutrophil infiltration, apoptosis, tumour necrosis-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) production, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation in injured tissue. Treatment of the mice with zileuton or montelukast reduced the spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, TNF-α, COX- 2 and pERK 1 / 2 expression, PGE 2 and LTB 4 production, and apoptosis. In separate experiments, zileuton or montelukast significantly improved the recovery of limb function over 10 days. Conclusions and implications: Zileuton and montelukast produced a substantial reduction of inflammatory events associated with experimental SCI. Our data underline the important role of 5 -LO and Cys-LT in neurotrauma...|$|R
40|$|A {{very strong}} {{correlation}} {{has been shown}} to exist between acid and neutral protease activity levels in the skin, the acid protease activity level of the oedema fluid, and the oedema-reducing ability of the benzo-pyrones and related drugs. Macrophages, which are believed to be the main cells affected by the drugs, are very common in thermally injured tissues. Their lysosomal enzymes work at an acid pH. Since the main acid protease is cathepsin D, the overall acid protease levels are representative of changes in cathepsin D levels. Elevated levels are concomitant with more complete and rapid digestion of accumulated protein. The resulting fragments then can rapidly leave the injured <b>tissues,</b> freeing the <b>oedema</b> fluid. This form of proteolysis is very much different from that which is used by pharmacologists as a measure of inflammation. Normal proteolysis in inflammation represents an estimate of tissue derangement, but the proteolysis induced by drugs such as the benzo-pyrones represents a means of lessening some of the more injurious effects of this derangement. The results presented here strongly confirm this...|$|R
