5|$|Prior to abandoning Bowling Green, Governor Johnson {{requested}} that Richard Hawes {{come to the}} city and help with the administration of the government, but Hawes was delayed due to a bout with typhoid fever. Following Johnson's death, the provisional government elected Hawes, who was still recovering from his illness, as governor. Following his recovery, Hawes joined the government in Corinth, Mississippi, and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office on May 31.|$|E
5|$|On 28 November 1864, he <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> {{to defend}} the new constitution, which created a unicameral {{assembly}} (Vouli) with representatives elected by direct, secret, universal male suffrage, a first in modern Europe. A constitutional monarchy was set up with George deferring to the legitimate authority of the elected officials, although {{he was aware of}} the corruption present in elections and the difficulty of ruling a mostly illiterate population. Between 1864 and 1910, there were 21 general elections and 70 different governments.|$|E
5|$|The need to matriculate was an obstacle. He used {{a family}} {{connection}} with St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, to attend {{as a day}} boy and passed his matriculation. He duly applied to the Supreme Court for admission as an attorney in the Transvaal, was accepted and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath.</b> He was offered a post with the leading firm of attorneys in Klerksdorp, but a clause in his articles prohibited Guest from practising in competition with Rood's firm for some years without the latter's permission.|$|E
50|$|As German {{constitutional}} {{law does not}} consider oaths of office as constitutive but only as affirmative, the President {{does not have to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> at <b>the</b> moment of entering office {{in order to be able}} to execute the powers of <b>the</b> office. <b>The</b> <b>oath</b> is usually administered during the first weeks of a president's term on a date convenient for a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. Nevertheless, a President persistently refusing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> could be impeached. If a President is re-elected for a second term, he or she does not <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> again.|$|R

25|$|The {{freethinker}} Charles Bradlaugh (1833–1891) {{was repeatedly}} {{elected to the}} British Parliament, but {{was not allowed to}} take his seat after his request to affirm rather than <b>take</b> <b>the</b> religious <b>oath</b> was turned down (he then offered to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath,</b> but this too was denied him). After Bradlaugh was re-elected for the fourth time, a new Speaker allowed Bradlaugh to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> and permitted no objections.

5|$|Ford was {{nominated}} to take Agnew's position on October 12, {{the first time}} the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented. The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. Only three Senators, all Democrats, voted against Ford's confirmation: Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri and William Hathaway of Maine. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. One hour after the confirmation vote in the House, Ford <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office as Vice President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1776, McDonald was {{appointed}} and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> {{of the sheriff}} and justice of Frederick County by the county court under an ordinance of the Virginia Convention of 1776. While serving as sheriff, he was placed {{in command of the}} militias of both Augusta and Frederick counties. At the time of his command of the Frederick and Augusta militias, the two counties encompassed much of the territory of Virginia between the Ohio River, the Tennessee boundary and the Blue Ridge Mountains, with the exception of Hampshire County which had been created from parts of Frederick and Augusta counties in 1754.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the General Assembly's contest committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital, awaiting the contest committee's findings. On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor, and the General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall.|$|E
50|$|The sole {{attempt to}} invoke {{this was in}} {{relation}} to the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1927, which penalised Oireachtas members who refused to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oath</b> of Allegiance. Fianna Fáil TDs, who were abstentionist and refused to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oath,</b> attempted to lodge a petition under Article 47; the then government introduced another bill to amend the Constitution such that only TDs and Senators who had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oath</b> would have <b>the</b> power to make such a petition. When Fianna Fáil subsequently entered the Dáil, the next government deleted Article 47 from the Constitution altogether in 1928.|$|R

5|$|Sverdrup {{enlisted in}} the US Army at Fort Snelling, Minnesota on 26 July 1918. He was posted to Camp Devens, Massachusetts for {{training}} with the 36th Division. While there he took advantage of a regulation waiving the normal five-year residency requirement {{for members of the}} armed services seeking to take out US citizenship. Sverdrup formally <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> as a citizen in Boston on 30 September 1918. The US Army then sent him to the Field Artillery's Officer Training Center at Camp Zachary Taylor, near Louisville, Kentucky, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 18 January 1919. The war having ended, Sverdrup was immediately placed in the inactive reserves. He was honorably discharged after nominally serving two five-year terms on 17 January 1929.|$|E
5|$|Taylor apprised President McKinley of the {{situation}} in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office.|$|E

5|$|By 1892, Greene was {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} Union general and the oldest living graduate of West Point. He petitioned the United States Congress for an engineer captain's pension that would be of help to his family after his death. The best that Congress {{was willing to do}} was arranged by Congressman and Gettysburg veteran Daniel E. Sickles of New York, a first lieutenant's pension, based on the highest rank Greene had achieved in the regular army. On August 18, 1894, Greene <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office as a first lieutenant of artillery and became, at 93, the oldest lieutenant in the U.S. Army for 48 hours. Veterans in the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) declared that he {{was the oldest}} lieutenant in world history.|$|E
5|$|Ex-Confederates {{dominated}} the Kentucky Democratic convention that met in Frankfort on February 22, 1867. John L. Helm, {{father of the}} late Confederate general Benjamin Hardin Helm, was nominated for governor and Stevenson was nominated for lieutenant governor. The entire Democratic slate of candidates was elected, including Stevenson, who received 88,222 votes to R. Tarvin Baker's 32,505 and H. Taylor's 11,473. The only non-Confederate sympathizer to win election that year was George Madison Adams, congressman for the state's 8th district who, although a Democrat, was a former federal soldier. Helm <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office on his sick bed {{at his home in}} Elizabethtown, Kentucky, on September 3, 1867. He died five days later, and Stevenson was sworn in as governor on September 13. Among his first acts as governor were the appointments of Frank Lane Wolford, a former Union soldier, as adjutant general and Fayette Hewitt, a former Confederate soldier, as state quartermaster general.|$|E
5|$|Governor Johnson {{was killed}} while {{participating}} in the Battle of Shiloh. Following the resolutions of the Russellville Convention, the provisional Confederate government's ten legislative councillors selected Hawes to succeed Johnson as governor. (Under these provisions, the councillors could not select one of their own.) He joined the leaderless and nomadic shadow government, which had been traveling with the Army of Tennessee, in Corinth, Mississippi, and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office on May 31. The army's leader, General Braxton Bragg, had been considering an invasion of Kentucky. On August 27, Hawes was dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to favorably recommend this action to President Jefferson Davis, but Davis was non-committal. Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith proceeded with the invasion nonetheless, while the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Hawes's return. They departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2.|$|E

5|$|Ruth Bader Ginsburg (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to be confirmed to the Court (after Sandra Day O'Connor), and one of four female justices to be confirmed (with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found {{the doors to the}} state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still lying on his sick bed, Goebel <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>oath</b> of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing {{that the president should}} set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler was the first to see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E
