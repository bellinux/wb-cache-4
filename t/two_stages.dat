5|$|The {{first of}} the <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> held in Vendée started in Passage du Gois and {{finished}} in Mont des Alouettes, whilst stage two was held in Les Essarts. The Tour left Vendée in Olonne-sur-Mer and headed north to Redon for the finish of the third stage. The following <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> {{took place in the}} region of Brittany. Stage six left the region to the finish in Lisieux. Stages seven and eight took the race through the middle of the country from Le Mans to the Super Besse resort in the elevated region Massif Central, which hosted stage nine. The following <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> headed south through the lower slopes, and stage twelve took the race into the Pyrenees. The mountain range hosted the next <b>two</b> <b>stages.</b> The fifteenth stage took place between Limoux and Montpellier. Stage sixteen took the route into the Alps. The next <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> took the race into Italy, with Pinerolo hosting between them. Stage nineteen was the last in the Alps, before the twentieth, which was held in the foothills around Grenoble. A long transfer took the Tour to its conclusion in Paris with the Champs-Élysées stage.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} class of <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> {{iterative}} methods, called <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> mixed-type splitting (TMS) algorithm, and analyze the convergence of this method for solving large nonsingular system of equations Ax=b. Based on this new method, we establish another <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> models such as <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> (SOR, AOR, SSOR, SAOR) algorithms. The convergence of these algorithms is discussed, {{under the condition that}} A is Z-matrix. Besides, convergence is further studied for splitting of M-matrix. Numerical example is also reported to confirm the convergence analysis...|$|R

Applications of simple random, stratified random, <b>two</b> <b>stage,</b> <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> cluster and three stage sampling were utilized on data of wheat production amounts from 828 towns of 78 cities of 7 geographical regions of Turkey in 1997.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the coalitional {{approach}} to sequential trading processes. We study the allocation of resources through sequential trading, when individuals {{have the option to}} form coalitions and make group decisions. We introduce a new core concept, called the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core, which is appropriate for analyzing asset market and differential information economies, with sequential trade. The <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core characterizes fully optimal allocations. vVe show that the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core always exists under standard continuity and concavity assumptions. We derive the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core of an asset markets economy as a specification of the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core. In order to capture the case of arbitrary short sales we provide a core existence proof for the case of consumption sets with no lower bound. Further, we show that the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core is non empty in the Hart (1975) example where a rational expectations equilibrium fails to exist. Finally, we apply this core concept to differential information economies and show that the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> core is incentive compatible in the sense that no coalition of agents can misreport the true state and provide improvements to all its members, even by redistributing the benefits from misreporting. Thus, our core notion results in allocations that are both fully optimal and incentive compatible. Sequential trades, core, asset markets, differential information, incentives...|$|R

5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} <b>two</b> <b>stages,</b> primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E

Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.|$|E
