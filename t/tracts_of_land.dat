5|$|A large temple also owned sizable <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic {{as well as}} religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} {{circulation of}} coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land, empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes. Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land, yet powerful merchants {{were able to}} avoid registration and own large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
50|$|George Herrold had a 146.2 acre <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> on {{the creek}} in 1765. It is unlikely, but possible, that Peter Shaffer {{settled on the}} creek around 1765. Michael Witmer gained access to a <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> on Mahantango Creek around 1770.|$|R

50|$|In 1899, both {{countries}} dug a channel across {{the heel of}} the horseshoe bend of the river at the dispute site for flood control purpose. This moved a 385-acre <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> to the U.S. side of the river, but as man-made alterations do not change the boundary, this <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> remained Mexican territory. This <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{came to be known}} as Cordova Island, in a sense it was an island belonging to Mexico inside U.S. territory. Thus, there was little or no control by the local authorities, which created a haven for crime and opportunities for illegal crossings.|$|R
5|$|Wendy {{caused a}} large amount of damage in central Japan. The storm flooded {{thousands}} of homes and damaged significant <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Some rivers overflowed and hundreds of bridges were destroyed. Overall, 28 people were killed, and 19 were missing.|$|E

5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor.

40|$|The Diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the current {{legislation}} of residential co-ownership, especially of administration of a building and <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> Its content {{is divided into two}} parts. The aim of {{the first part of the}} thesis is to present fundamental interpretation of an institute of residential co-ownership which is one of the types of co-ownership with a large number of specifics. The thesis includes also an outline of its historical development, an analysis of conceptual theories of residential co-ownership and explanation of essential terms of the institute. As one of the most important terms is considered the term unit. For correct understanding the thesis explains also other terms which the legislation of the unit expressly operates with. The relevant examples are the terms flat, commercial premises, building and <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and share <b>of</b> a building and <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The first part of the thesis serves to obtain fundamental information about an institution of residential co-ownership and its essential elements that will be used during a deeper research in the second part. The second part of the thesis deals with comprehensive legislation analysis of administration of a building and <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The constituent chapters include a definition of administration of a building and <b>tract</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated.

The mining company had buried only a few dead; others remained lying in the open, mangled, decomposing, and partially eaten by dogs, hogs, or other animals.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep farming is more common in the northwestern provinces of the country, where such <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> exist. China does have a native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E
