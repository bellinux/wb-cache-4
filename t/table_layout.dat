50|$|The {{instruction}} set is a reasonably simple MIPS-like traditional RISC using a 3-operand load-store architecture, with 16 or 32 general-purpose registers and a fixed 32-bit instruction length.

This paper introduces a typed assembly language whose type system is expressive enough to type-check a Cheney-queue copying garbage collector, so that ordinary programs and garbage collection can co-exist and interact inside a single typed language. The only built-in types for memory are linear types describing individual memory words, so that TAL programmers can define their own object <b>layouts,</b> method <b>table</b> <b>layouts,</b> heap layouts, and memory management techniques. 1...|$|R
