25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He just sat in his {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

500|$|In September 1952, Kennan made a {{statement}} that cost him his ambassadorship. In an {{answer to a question}} at a press conference, Kennan compared his conditions at the ambassador's residence in Moscow to those he had encountered while interned in Berlin during {{the first few months of}} the Second World War. While his statement was not unfounded, the Soviets interpreted it as an implied analogy with Nazi Germany. The Soviets then declared Kennan persona non grata and refused to allow him to re-enter the USSR. Kennan acknowledged retrospectively that it was a [...] "foolish <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have said".|$|E
5000|$|Lyonne {{feels that}} she can relate closely to Nichols' storyline as she has had {{experience}} of drug addiction. She says, [...] "believe me, there's no shortage of <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> draw on {{when it comes to}} Nicky's backstory". The scar that is visible on Nichols' chest during the series is a real scar from Lyonne's heart surgery in 2012. Orange Is the New Black is Lyonne's first time as a series regular.|$|R
5000|$|Unable {{to have a}} {{conversation}} due to their language barrier, Dumont and DeCarlo communicated through his cartoons. In a later interview, Josie explained their early courtship, [...] "We communicated with drawing...He would draw <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make <b>me</b> understand what he had in mind. He was really so amusing. Instead of just using words, he would use cartoons to express himself. Right away, we knew that we were meant for each other." ...|$|R

He says: [...] "And when I {{was sent}} away on duty to another village, and so {{could not find}} time to write either to you or to her, she came close {{to the place where}} I was and where no one is {{permitted}} to come and asked to see her boy. She brought with her a great parcel of <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> eat. What more am I to say for the concern she has for my welfare?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{following}} the attempted change in Senate leadership, Governor David Paterson {{announced that he}} would avoid out-of-state travel, saying [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do is to stay here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rodger had a YouTube {{account and}} a blog titled [...] "Elliot Rodger's Official Blog", {{both of which}} {{contained}} posts expressing loneliness and rejection.

2500|$|She said, [...] "It is one <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{come before}} a public magistracy {{and there to}} speak {{what they would have}} me speak and another when a man comes to me in a way of {{friendship}} privately." [...] Hutchinson's defense was that she had spoken only reluctantly and in private, and that she [...] "must either speak false or true in my answers" [...] in the ministerial context of the meeting. [...] The court, however, did not make any distinction between public and private statements.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story was}} partly {{inspired}} by Oscar, a therapy cat who allegedly predicts {{the deaths of}} terminally ill patients. King said, [...] "I thought to myself: ‘I {{want to write a}} story about that.’ And then I made the connection with Danny Torrance as an adult, working in a hospice. I thought: ‘That’s it. I’m gonna write this book. The cat had to be there. It always takes two <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get going. It’s like the cat was the transmission and Danny was the motor." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} {{if he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adlai Stevenson {{enjoyed his}} role as vice president, {{presiding}} over the U.S. Senate, [...] "the most august legislative assembly known to men." [...] He won praise for ruling in a dignified, nonpartisan manner. In personal appearance he stood six feet tall and was [...] "of fine personal bearing and uniformly courteous to all." [...] Although he was often a guest at the White House, Stevenson admitted that he was less {{an adviser to the}} president than [...] "the neighbor to his counsels." [...] He credited the President with being [...] "courteous at all times" [...] but noted that [...] "no guards were necessary to the preservation of his dignity. No one would have thought of undue familiarity." [...] For his part, President Cleveland snorted that the Vice President had surrounded himself with a coterie of free-silver men dubbed the [...] "Stevenson cabinet." [...] The president even mused that the economy had gotten so bad and the Democratic party so divided that [...] "the logical <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do ... was to resign and hand the Executive branch to Mr. Stevenson," [...] joking that he would try to get his friends jobs in Stevenson's new cabinet.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. Maybe it is because they are the easiest and yet the hardest <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach this in my first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if I fail, I have to build up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself. I don't know whether other actresses get this same reaction or not, but it does worry me." ...|$|R
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do because I liked him but I really felt {{what he did was}} awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
2500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest, {{the leak}} that Tony Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as {{evidence}} that the dam was leaking {{on the day of the}} break, and that both the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and Mulholland were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy about this thing are the ones who are dead." [...] In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, [...] "Whether it is good or bad, don't blame anyone else, you just fasten it on me. If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won't try to fasten it on anyone else." ...|$|E
