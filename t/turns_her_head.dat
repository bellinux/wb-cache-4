25|$|In the {{painting}} generally titled The Lady with an Ermine (about 1483) {{he sets the}} figure diagonally to the picture space and <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> so that her face is almost parallel to her nearer shoulder. The {{back of her head}} and the further shoulder are deeply shadowed. Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way that}} the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the lyrics}} of the song like [...] "Do {{you want to see}} me down on my knees?" [...] portray female helplessness, the video {{performance}} acts as a counter-text to it. When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling on the road in front of the advancing car, then <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{to the side and}} looks into the distance, as the camera pans away.|$|E
60|$|She half <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Her</b> {{expression}} was scarcely encouraging.|$|R
60|$|Without <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> toward him, Eleanor {{addressed}} Trowse.|$|R
60|$|Letty {{advanced}} doubtfully {{into the}} room. Wilhelmina <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She never <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Lady or servant, she has {{a purpose}} in her and can follow it. She never <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> until she comes to the {{crossing}} where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs. Still, she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other side. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, [...] "Come here!" ...|$|E
60|$|RAINA (indignantly). I did {{not send}} it to you. (She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away, and adds, reluctantly.) It was {{in the pocket of}} that coat.|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE. Take me as I am: I ask no more. [She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to {{the study}} door and cries] Yes: come in, come in.|$|E
60|$|Millicent <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> half-indignant, half-embarrassed, and Mrs. Keith laughed.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Groves {{had come}} once more within hearing.|$|R
60|$|Virginia <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{away and}} stared out over the fields.|$|R
60|$|Mercury in {{attendance}} with coffee informs Sir Leicester, hereupon, that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner. My Lady <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> inward for the moment, then looks out again as before.|$|E
6000|$|As {{she turns}} he looks swiftly at her, {{sweeping}} {{her up and}} down. She [...] <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and catches his glance, which is swiftly dropped. [...] Will Monsieur not 'ave anything to eat? ...|$|E
6000|$|... [She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to {{hide her}} emotion, and withdraws. NAPOLEON [...] steps up to her, and offers his arm. She takes it silently, and [...] he {{perceives}} the tears on her cheeks. They cross towards the ante- [...] room, {{away from the other}} guests.] ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Mortimer <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to Billy, who {{was just}} entering.|$|R
60|$|PICKERING. You're {{certainly}} not going to <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> with flattery, Higgins.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> towards me, and {{answered}} in her gayest tones.|$|R
60|$|Overhead, {{the larger}} stars {{came out and}} winked at me, and then, as the fields of space {{became more and more}} lighted with star-points, the hearth-fires to other homes of worlds, I thought how local, after all, is the great cone of shadow we men call night; for it is only nature's nightcap for the nodding earth, as she <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away from the sun to lie pillowed in space.|$|E
6000|$|CRAVEN. At your service, Paramore: at your service. (Craven and Paramore go {{into the}} {{consulting}} room. Julia <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and stares insolently at Charteris. His nerves play him false: he is completely out of countenance in a moment. She rises suddenly. He starts, and comes hastily forward between {{the table and the}} bookcase. She crosses to that side behind the table; and he immediately crosses to the opposite side in front of it, dodging her.) ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (starts to {{his feet}} with wild, bewildered eyes--confusedly). Oh--you---- (Miss Gilpin cannot {{restrain}} an exclamation of dismay as she sees his face wrung by despair. Eileen <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away with a little cry, as if she would hide {{her face in the}} bedclothes. A sudden fierce resolution lights up Murray's countenance--hoarsely.) You're just in the nick of time, Miss Gilpin! Eileen! Listen! You'll believe Miss Gilpin, won't you? She knows all about it. (Eileen turns her eyes questioningly on the bewildered nurse.) ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the garden}} door Barbara <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> smiled, and passed through.|$|R
60|$|It seemed terribly intimate. Irene blushed {{deeply and}} <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away.|$|R
60|$|Miss Garland blushed and, <b>turning</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> gazed {{steadily}} at the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine, then. When I gave her, {{just to be}} friends, because--because I loved her, {{a little}} ivory box, nothing of any value, of course, but which I have loved and treasured since childhood, she left it without a thought. It's in my {{wardrobe}} drawer--shall I show it to you? I say it was nothing in itself; but what I mean is that she just makes use of me, and with far less generosity than--than other people do. Her eyes, her voice, when she moves her hand, <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> looks back--oh, I know! But," [...] and I turned on him in the light, [...] "does it mean anything? Let us just help her all we can, and--keep away." ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and in a}} {{flash of}} {{laughter}} [...] Looks up at him: and helplessly he feels [...] That life has circled with returning wheels [...] Back to a starting-point. Before and after [...] Merge in this instant, momently the same: [...] For it was thus she leaned and laughing turned [...] When, manifest, the spirit of beauty burned [...] In her young body with an inward flame, [...] And first he knew and loved her. In full tide [...] Life halts within him, suddenly stupefied. [...] Sight blackness, lightning-struck; but blindly tender [...] He draws her up to meet him, and she lies [...] Close folded by his arms in glad surrender, [...] Smiling, and with drooped head and half closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|As the {{afternoon}} wears away, and long shadows come creeping up the hillside, the mother rises suddenly {{and goes back}} to the den; the little ones stop their play, and gather about her. You strain your ears for the slightest sound, but hear nothing; yet there she is, plainly talking to them; and they are listening. She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and the cubs scamper into the den's mouth. A moment she stands listening, looking; while just within the dark entrance you get glimpses of four pointed black noses, and a cluster of bright little eyes, wide open for a last look. Then she trots away, planning her hunt, till she disappears down by the brook. When she is gone, eyes and noses draw back; only a dark silent hole in the bank is left. You will not see them again--not unless you stay to watch by moonlight till mother-fox comes back, with a fringe of field-mice hanging from her lips, or a young turkey thrown across her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Then Yvonne <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{slowly and}} looked calmly on her enemy.|$|R
5000|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{into the}} sky, {{and then they}} heard her cry! ...|$|R
60|$|She slowly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> toward him, and a faint sigh escaped her.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{she throws}} around a glance, and two streams of liquid light pour from her hazel eyes on his. It was a rapid, graceful movement, unstudied as {{the motion of}} a fawn, and was in a moment withdrawn, yet was it long enough to stamp upon his memory a memorable countenance. Her face was quite oval, her nose delicately aquiline, and her high pure {{forehead}} like a Parian dome. The clear blood coursed under her transparent cheek, and increased the brilliancy of her dazzling eyes. His never left her. There was an expression of decision about her small mouth, an air of almost mockery in her curling lip, which, though in themselves wildly fascinating, strangely contrasted with all the beaming light and beneficent lustre of {{the upper part of}} her countenance. There was something, too, in the graceful but rather decided air with which she moved, that seemed to betoken her self-consciousness of her beauty or her rank; perhaps it might be her wit; for the Duke observed that while she scarcely smiled, and conversed with lips hardly parted, her companion, with whom she was evidently intimate, was almost constantly convulsed with laughter, although, as he never spoke, it was clearly not at his own jokes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This was the period, {{about three}} months after she had commenced, that the first report of her case was made, {{in which it was}} stated that [...] "she has just learned the manual alphabet, as used by the deaf mutes, and it is a subject of delight and wonder to see how rapidly, correctly, and eagerly, she goes on with her labours. Her teacher gives her a new object, for instance, a pencil, first lets her examine it, and get an idea of its use, then teaches her how to spell it by making the signs for the letters with her own fingers: [...] the child grasps her hand, and feels her fingers, as the {{different}} letters are formed; she <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> a little on one side like a person listening closely; her lips are apart; she seems scarcely to breathe; and her countenance, at first anxious, gradually changes to a smile, as she comprehends the lesson. She then holds up her tiny fingers, and spells the word in the manual alphabet; next, she takes her types and arranges her letters; and last, to make sure that she is right, she takes the whole of the types composing the word, and places them upon or in contact with the pencil, or whatever the object may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{midday sun}} was {{streaming}} into Hetty's bedchamber, {{and there was}} no blind to temper the heat with which it fell on her head as she looked at herself in the old specked glass. Still, that was the only glass she had in which she could see her neck and arms, for the small hanging glass she had fetched out of the next room--the room that had been Dinah's--would show her nothing below her little chin; and that beautiful bit of neck where the roundness of her cheek melted into another roundness shadowed by dark delicate curls. And to-day she thought more than usual about her neck and arms; for at the dance this evening she was not to wear any neckerchief, and she had been busy yesterday with her spotted pink-and-white frock, that she might make the sleeves either long or short at will. She was dressed now just as she was to be in the evening, with a tucker made of [...] "real" [...] lace, which her aunt had lent her for this unparalleled occasion, but with no ornaments besides; she had even taken out her small round ear-rings which she wore every day. But there was something more to be done, apparently, before she put on her neckerchief and long sleeves, which she was to wear in the day-time, for now she unlocked the drawer that held her private treasures. It is more than a month since we saw her unlock that drawer before, and now it holds new treasures, so much more precious than the old ones that these are thrust into the corner. Hetty would not care to put the large coloured glass ear-rings into her ears now; for see! she has got a beautiful pair of gold and pearls and garnet, lying snugly in a pretty little box lined with white satin. Oh, the delight of taking out that little box and looking at the ear-rings! Do not reason about it, my philosphical reader, and say that Hetty, being very pretty, must have known that it did not signify whether she had on any ornaments or not; and that, moreover, to look at ear-rings which she could not possibly wear out of her bedroom could hardly be a satisfaction, the essence of vanity being a reference to the impressions produced on others; you will never understand women's natures if you are so excessively rational. Try rather to divest yourself of all your rational prejudices, as much as if you were studying the psychology of a canary bird, and only watch the movements of this pretty round creature as she <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on one side with an unconscious smile at the ear-rings nestled in the little box. Ah, you think, it is {{for the sake of the}} person who has given them to her, and her thoughts are gone back now to the moment when they were put into her hands. No; else why should she have cared to have ear-rings rather than anything else? And I know that she had longed for ear-rings from among all the ornaments she could imagine.|$|E
60|$|She slowly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} at him with a dull surprise.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away, and I {{could see}} that she was crying.|$|R
60|$|She <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly, {{and looked}} at him with frightened, wide-open eyes.|$|R
