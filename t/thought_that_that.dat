5|$|The Griffin {{family first}} {{appeared}} on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998. Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{was the place to}} create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E

500|$|After {{playing for}} the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico, Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946. He made the All-Star roster, batted [...]360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six). Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles, {{including}} Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit [...]372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering {{a career in the}} MLB, Doby said, [...] "I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was the way it was going to be. There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in '46." ...|$|E

500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E
2500|$|The Minnesota Orchestra {{was founded}} in 1903 as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Although it {{was among the first}} to perform on the radio and to record, it {{initially}} was not known as one of the country's great orchestras. In the 1930s, Eugene Ormandy transformed it into an excellent ensemble and expanded its repertory, making it the most-recorded orchestra in the United States, and giving it an international reputation. Other illustrious conductors included Dimitri Mitropoulos and Antal Dorati. Osmo Vänskä, a Finnish conductor, music director since 2003, took the orchestra into its second century. Its live performances and recordings in a program of the complete works of Ludwig van Beethoven have been received with enthusiasm, the group has been called [...] "brilliant", and a critic has stated the musicians are enjoying [...] "their first golden age" [...] since the days of Ormandy and Mitropoulos. Another critic wrote for The New Yorker of a concert in 2010 and its [...] "uncanny, wrenching power, the kind you hear once or twice a decade" [...] and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> day the Minnesota Orchestra was [...] "the greatest orchestra in the world". [...] The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the only full-time professional chamber orchestra in the country, [...] and also tours and records. [...] Professional orchestral ensembles outside the Twin Cities include the Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra and the Rochester Symphony Orchestra and Chorale.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the success}} of Hellbilly Deluxe, Zombie {{released}} American Made Music to Strip By in October of 1999. The album was composed solely of remixes of songs featured on Hellbilly Deluxe, featuring contributions from Charlie Clouser and Rammstein, among others. The album was a commercial success in the United States, entering the top forty of the Billboard 200. In 2010, Zombie announced that his fourth studio album would be titled [...] (2010). When asked about the album's title, Zombie was quoted as stating [...] "Well, it was around the ten- year anniversary of the first record, and the idea just popped into my head. It really wasn’t this big master plan by any means, I just knew I wanted to return to the old ways of doing things, and I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> would be a good starting point." [...] Songs taken from Hellbilly Deluxe were featured in Zombie's retrospective album Past, Present & Future (2003). The album featured songs from both Zombie's work with White Zombie as well as his solo career, along with some new material. Songs from Hellbilly Deluxe would later appear in Zombie's greatest hits collections The Best of Rob Zombie: 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection (2006) and Icon (2010). Zombie has included songs taken from the album on all of his subsequent tours, including his Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour (2009-12). The music found on the album has been used extensively in the media, including films, video games, and television. [...] "Dragula" [...] and [...] "Superbeast" [...] have been covered by acts such as Motionless In White and Suicide Silence, respectively. The songs [...] "Superbeast", [...] "Dragula", [...] "Living Dead Girl", [...] "Meet the Creeper", [...] "How to Make a Monster", and [...] "Demonoid Phenomenon" [...] were all covered on the tribute album The Electro-Industrial Tribute to Rob Zombie (2002).|$|E
