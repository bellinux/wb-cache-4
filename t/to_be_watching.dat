5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he always seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E

500|$|During World War II, the 91st Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces {{referred}} to the gesture as the [...] "rigid digit" [...] salute. It was used in a more jocular manner, to suggest an airman had committed an error or infraction; the term was a reference to British slang terms for inattentiveness (i.e. [...] "pull your finger out (of your bum)"). The [...] "order of the rigid digit" [...] continued after the war {{as a series of}} awards presented by the veteran's association of the 91st, marked by wooden statuettes of a hand giving the single finger gesture.

500|$|While {{the film}} portrays Andy {{escaping}} to freedom through a sewer pipe {{described as a}} [...] "river of shit," [...] Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, {{you want to be}} a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. However, the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, and producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemptions domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda.|$|E
500|$|... "Her chief characteristics… were {{a strong}} will and a {{singularly}} straightforward habit {{of thought and}} action", wrote her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova, who recalled Olga's hot temper and her struggles to keep it under control. [...] "Admirable qualities in a woman, these same characteristics are often trying in childhood, and Olga {{as a little girl}} sometimes showed herself willful and even disobedient." [...] Olga idolized her father and wore a necklace with an icon of St. Nicholas on her chest. She, like her siblings, enjoyed games of tennis and swimming with her father during their summer holidays and often confided in him when she went with him on long walks. Though she also loved Alexandra, her relationship with her mother was somewhat strained during her adolescence and early adulthood. [...] "Olga is always most unamiable about every proposition, though may end by doing what I wish", wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on March 13, 1916. [...] "And when I am severe — sulks me." [...] In another letter to Nicholas during World War I, Alexandra complained that Olga's grumpiness, bad humor and general reluctance to make an official visit to the hospital where she usually worked as a Red Cross nurse made things difficult. Olga also occasionally found her mother's attitude trying. Parlormaid Elizaveta Nikolaevna Ersberg told her niece that the Tsar paid closer attention to the children than Alexandra did and Alexandra often was ill with a migraine or quarreled with the servants. In 1913, Olga complained in a letter to her grandmother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna about her mother's invalidism. [...] "As usual her heart isn't well", Olga wrote. [...] "It's all so unpleasant." [...] Queen Marie of Romania, who met Olga and her sisters when they visited Romania on a state trip in 1914, commented in her memoirs that the girls were natural and confided in her when Alexandra wasn't present, but when she appeared [...] "they always seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> her every expression so as to be sure to act according to her desires." ...|$|E
