5|$|Along {{with several}} other roads in <b>the</b> <b>Highlands,</b> the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads in <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E

50|$|Behind <b>the</b> <b>Highland</b> Towers was a {{small stream}} of water known as East Creek.

5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is the distinction between <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and Islands {{in the north and}} west and the Lowlands in the south and east. <b>The</b> <b>highlands</b> are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England ran. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width and, because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional government. However, the Southern Uplands, and particularly <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, in the extreme case of the upper Grampians an ice free season of four months or less and for much of <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and Uplands of seven months or less. The early modern period also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, with 1564 seeing thirty-three days of continual frost, where rivers and lochs froze, leading to a series of subsistence crisis until the 1690s.|$|E
5|$|The deposed Jacobite Stuart claimants had {{remained}} popular in <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and north-east, particularly amongst non-Presbyterians, including Roman Catholics and Episcopalian Protestants. However, two major Jacobite Risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed {{to remove the}} House of Hanover from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the Battle of Culloden, Great Britain's last pitched battle. This defeat {{paved the way for}} large-scale removals of the indigenous populations of <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and Islands, known as the Highland Clearances.|$|E

5|$|Armies {{of workers}} would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in <b>the</b> <b>highlands</b> above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the {{trenches}} behind each successive retaining {{wall of the}} step pyramids with the stone-filled bags.|$|E
5|$|Episcopalianism had {{retained}} supporters {{through the}} civil wars and changes of {{regime in the}} seventeenth century. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions {{in the first half}} of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement benefited the secessionist churches who gained recruits.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 local {{government}} in Scotland was again reformed, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, to create 32 unitary council areas. <b>The</b> <b>Highland</b> region became <b>the</b> <b>Highland</b> unitary council area, and {{the functions of}} the district councils were absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>Highland</b> Council.|$|R

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

5|$|In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became {{governor}} of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As {{a result of the}} survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered {{the construction of a new}} port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into <b>the</b> <b>highlands.</b> Indigenous guides scouting the route from <b>the</b> <b>highlands</b> would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below Quiriguá, because the area was inhabited by the hostile Toquegua.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Highland</b> School is a {{democratic}} school for day and boarding students in Highland, West Virginia.

50|$|To {{many people}} within the area, using <b>the</b> name <b>Highland</b> as a noun sounds wrong. Dingwall in Highland, for example, sounds strange and is not idiomatic usage. To refer {{specifically}} to the area covered by the council, people tend to say <b>the</b> <b>Highland</b> Council area or <b>the</b> <b>Highland</b> area or <b>the</b> <b>Highland</b> region. Otherwise, they may also refer to the traditional county names, such as Ross.|$|R

5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, popular {{education}} was challenged by problems of distance and physical isolation, {{as well as}} teachers' and ministers' limited knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, the primary local language. Here the Kirk's parish schools were supplemented by those established from 1709 by the Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Its aim in <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> was to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. Though the SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture. Literacy rates were lower in <b>the</b> <b>Highlands</b> than in comparable Lowland rural society, and despite these efforts illiteracy remained prevalent into the nineteenth century.|$|E
