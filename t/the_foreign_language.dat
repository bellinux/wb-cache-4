These procedures were slightly modified for the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, with the Academy deciding to institute a two-stage process in determining the nominees: {{for the first time}} in the history of the award, a nine-film shortlist was published one week before the official nominations announcement. In the meantime, a smaller thirty-member committee which included ten New York City-based Academy members was formed, and spent three days viewing the shortlisted films before choosing the five official nominees.
