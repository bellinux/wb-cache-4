5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi lack an {{efficient}} {{system for the}} long-distance <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{data from}} an {{autonomous}} ocean glider in the Ibiza Channel (Western Mediterranean Sea) show {{variations in the}} <b>transport</b> volumes <b>of</b> <b>water</b> over timescales <b>of</b> days-weeks, as large as those previously only identifiable as seasonal or eddy driven. High frequency variation in <b>transports</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> masses has critical implications for ocean forecasting. Three potential modes <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> are proposed, which {{have the potential to}} simplify the previously observed complex pattern of flows. Restricted ‘choke points’ between ocean basins are critical locations to monitor water transport variability; the Ibiza Channel is one such ‘choke point’, where variation in the <b>transports</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> masses are known to affect the spawning grounds of commercially important fish stocks...|$|R

25|$|The general {{movement}} of the EGC is southward along the eastern Greenland continental margin. The currents are quite strong with annual averages of 6–12cm/s in {{the upper part of}} the EGC (<500 m) with inter-annual maximums of 20–30nbsp&cm/s. It was estimated in 1991 by Hopkins et al. that the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> southward ranged from 2–32 sverdrups. That is quite a large variation that they attributed to the widely varying strength of the Atlantic Water flow at intermediate depths. More recent estimations of water transport in the top layers (<800 m) of the EGC is between 3 and 4 sverdrups.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} potential is explained here {{since it is}} the true driving force for the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the {{chemical potential}} (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The chemical potential of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} S.sempervirens is {{closely tied to}} fog availability; taller trees become less {{frequent}} as fog becomes less frequent. As S.sempervirens’ height increases, transporting water via water potential to the leaves becomes increasingly more difficult due to gravity. Despite the high rainfall that the region receives (up to 100cm), the leaves in the upper canopy are perpetually stressed for water. This water stress is exacerbated by long droughts in the summer. Water stress is believed to cause the morphological changes in the leaves, stimulating reduced leaf length and increased leaf succulence. To supplement their water needs, redwoods utilize frequent summer fog events. Fog water is absorbed through multiple pathways. Leaves directly take in fog from the surrounding air through the epidermal tissue, bypassing the xylem. Coast redwoods also absorb water directly through their bark. The uptake of water through leaves and bark repairs and reduces the severity of xylem embolisms, which occur when cavitations form in the xylem preventing the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and nutrients. Fog may also collect on redwood leaves, drip to the forest floor, and be absorbed by the tree's roots. This fog drip may form 30% of the total water used by a tree in a year.|$|E

500|$|Particularly {{since the}} mid-1960s {{there have been}} {{advances}} in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> within plant tissues), [...] the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the leaf surface and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, {{and the rate of}} photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. Frederick Campion Steward pioneered techniques of micropropagation and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones. The synthetic auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D {{was one of the first}} commercial synthetic herbicides.|$|E

Unlike standard MS, the attacks are not believed to be mediated by the immune system's T cells, but rather by antibodies called NMO-IgG, or simply NMO antibodies.
