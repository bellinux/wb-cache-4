40|$|The {{production}} of chemokines, RANTES and IL- 8 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts {{and the effects}} of <b>tacalcitol</b> (1 α, 24 (R) -dihydroxyvitamin D 3) were studied using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the unstimulated condition, RANTES and IL- 8 were at a trace level in the culture supernatant. On stimulation with TNF-α alone for 24 [*]h, RANTES and IL- 8 production were induced. <b>Tacalcitol</b> suppressed RANTES and IL- 8 production dose-dependently at concentrations between 10 − 12 [*]M and 10 − 7 [*]M. When the cells were treated with TNF-α and IFN-γ in combination, RANTES production was enhanced, but IL- 8 production was not changed, compared to TNF-α-treated cells. <b>Tacalcitol</b> decreased IL- 8 production dose-dependently as observed in the TNF-α-treated cells. On the other hand, RANTES production was enhanced by 10 − 11 [*]M and 10 − 10 [*]M of <b>tacalcitol,</b> and dose-dependently suppressed by <b>tacalcitol</b> concentrations higher than 10 − 9 [*]M. Active vitamin D 3 compounds, betamethasone valerate and cyclosporin A were compared with respect to their effects on chemokine production. Three active vitamin D 3 compounds, <b>tacalcitol,</b> 1 α, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and MC 903 (calcipotriol), inhibited the {{production of}} RANTES and IL- 8, with very similar potencies. Betamethasone valerate also inhibited these chemokine productions, but with greater potency than active vitamin D 3 compounds. Cyclosporin A significantly stimulated RANTES production at 10 − 6 [*]M and IL- 8 production at 10 − 7 [*]M and 10 − 6 [*]M.

40|$|Aim. An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} the modifications of the superficial capillary bed in a psoriatic plaque and the perilesional healthy skin during treatment with <b>tacalcitol</b> by means of video-capillaroscopy (VC). Methods. Twenty-four patients suffering from psoriasis vulgaris over no more than 15 % of the body were studied for a period of 3 months during treatment with 4 mg/g <b>tacalcitol</b> ointment Once a psoriatic plaque had been selected, a visual clinical assessment was made and capillaroscopic measurements were taken with VC at the time of recruitment (TO), after 4 weeks (T 1), after 8 (T 2) and after 12 weeks (T 3). Results. The lesions studied gradually improved {{and at the end of}} the study the psoriatic plaques had disappeared in 12 patients. Even the diameter of the "basket" type capillaries had reduced significantly (average diameter: 67. 64 at the beginning of the study; 34. 08 at the end of the study), but only in 4 patients did the surface capillary plexus reappear with altered capillary loops. In the apparently healthy perilesional skin, 14 patients had abnormally elongated capillary loops. At the end of treatment, only 4 patients still had altered capillary loops. Conclusion. <b>Tacalcitol</b> proved to be effective in reducing the clinical and capillaroscopic alterations. Nevertheless, the microcirculatory improvement does not perfectly follow the clinical improvement. We also noted that the <b>tacalcitol</b> action on the microcirculation is not only limited to the area of application, but also extends to the surrounding areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to therapeutic options such as steroid ointment, immunosuppressive drug and ultraviolet phototherapy, recent reports {{have demonstrated the}} clinical efficacy of topical vitamin D 3 for vitiligo vulgaris.

In the present study, we evaluated the clinical difference of sun irradiation vs. narrowband UVB in combination with <b>tacalcitol</b> assessing the change of lesion size and color tone by a spectrophotometer. Thirty-three vitiligo patients were composed of 19 treated with sun illumination and 14 treated with narrowband UVB in combination with topical use of <b>tacalcitol.</b> The mean % size reduction was higher in the group of sunbathing than narrowband UVB (29 % vs. 23 %).

40|$|AbstractEosinophils are {{important}} inflammatory cells {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Vitamin D and its derivatives, {{in addition to their}} classic role as regulators of electrolytes homeostasis, have modulatory effects in immunological and inflammatory responses. Such properties suggest that vitamin D might also play a role in inflammatory airway diseases such as CRSwNP. In this study, we investigated the effect of vitamin D derivatives (calcitriol and <b>tacalcitol)</b> on the secretion of eotaxin and Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), the two major eosinophil chemoattractants, in fibroblasts derived from the polyps of Taiwanese CRSwNP patients. Patients diagnosed with eosinophilic CRSwNP but without malignancies or asthma and undergoing elective endoscopic sinus surgery were recruited. Three primary fibroblast cultures were established using the polyp specimens obtained from these patients. The third to eighth passages of the fibroblasts were used for in vitro studies. Nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts were stimulated with IL- 1 β (10  ng/mL) for 24 hours, followed by replacement with media alone or with calcitriol or <b>tacalcitol</b> (10 μM) and incubation for another 24 hours. After the treatments, the levels of secreted eotaxin and RANTES were evaluated by ELISA assays. The results showed that IL- 1 β could substantially stimulate the secretion of eotaxin (p <  0. 01) and RANTES (p <  0. 01) in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts. More importantly, this stimulatory effect was significantly suppressed by adding calcitriol (p ≤  0. 002 for eotaxin and p ≤  0. 008 for RANTES) or <b>tacalcitol</b> (p ≤  0. 009 for eotaxin and p ≤  0. 02 for RANTES). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of vitamin D derivatives on eotaxin and RANTES secretion might shed light not only on the disease mechanism, but also on the potential use of vitamin D in pharmacotherapy of Taiwanese patients with CRSwNP...|$|E

However, the risk factors for hypercalcemia resulting from these ointments, and interactions with underlying disorders and age are unclear. We performed a retrospective study of psoriasis patients at Nagoya City University Hospital between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, treated with a vitamin D 3 -containing topical drug, either calcipotriol, maxacalcitol, or <b>tacalcitol.</b> Data from blood samples and clinical scores collected during routine visits throughout the study period were analyzed. We assessed changes in the serum calcium levels over time in association with age, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, concomitant medication, and concomitant therapy. Serum calcium levels were significantly lower in the calcipotriol group than in the maxacalcitol group (P &lt; 0. 05), regardless of other factors, at the observation period. Calcipotriol was associated with lower serum calcium levels than maxacalcitol in patients &ge; 65 years (P &lt; 0. 05), those with renal disease (P = 0. 0362), and those with liver disease (P = 0. 0255). Only three patients using calcipotriol developed hypercalcemia that {{did not seem to}} be related to the treatment. Hypercalcemia was observed in 10 patients using maxacalcitol, although serum calcium levels rapidly recovered when use was discontinued. Only one patient using <b>tacalcitol</b> developed hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia tended to occur in patients with conditions in which the skin is more vulnerable, even at standard doses; patients taking oral etretinate; patients requiring concomitant systemic therapy, even if the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was not severe; and patients with renal or liver dysfunction. These findings highlight the importance of the awareness of the risk factors for hypercalcemia in patients treated with topical vitamin D 3 ointment, and point to calcipotriol as the first-choice treatment for those over 65 years old, or those with renal or liver disease.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to further {{investigate}} and to objectively assess the effects of <b>tacalcitol</b> on psoriasis by means of double-blind comparisons with placebo and betamethasone valerate, documented by instrumental evaluation. The study was conducted as intrasubject half-side right-left comparisons. Twelve subjects entered a double-blind placebo-controlled treatment (tacalcitol/placebo group), whereas 14 subjects received double-blind medication with tacalcitol/betamethasone valerate. Medications were applied once daily without occlusion to affected skin areas. Instrumental evaluations were carried out {{by means of a}} colorimeter and a 20 -MHz B scanner. The colour co-ordinate a*, representing the colour range from green (-) to red (+), was used for assessing erythema. B scan images were processed according to segmentation procedures. A 0 - 10 interval, marking the hyporeflecting dermal areas, was used for assessing oedema and inflammatory infiltration at psoriatic plaque sites. Twenty-two patients (11 of the tacalcitol/betamethasone group and 11 of the tacalcitol/ placebo group) completed the treatment period. Mean a* values showed an increase in the tacalcitol/betamethasone group after the first week of therapy on both sides, followed by a slight decrease, the values of which did not reach statistical relevance for either treatment. The decrease observed at tacalcitol-treated sites in patients of the tacalcitol/placebo group was not significant either with respect to baseline values during the first weeks of therapy. The extension of 0 - 10 dermal areas decreased both in betamethasone- and tacalcitol-treated areas in both patient groups. No significant differences were noticeable between the two treatments at all assessment points, although both by clinical and echographic evaluation a more pronounced decrease in clinical scores and in echogenicity values was observable at betamethasone-valerate-treated sites, especially at weeks 6 and 8. According to our data, assessment of erythema does not always represent a valid method for monitoring the response to therapy in psoriatic patients.

Among a series of tested analogs the diastereomeric analog PRI- 2202 showed the strongest antiproliferative activity on the human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7, whereas the geometric analog PRI- 2205 was the weakest. Both analogs were less potent in antiproliferative activity against HL- 60 cells compared to the reference compounds. The ability to potentiate antiproliferative effect of cisplatin or doxorubicin against HL- 60 cells or that of tamoxifen against the MCF- 7 cell line was observed at higher doses of PRI- 2202 or PRI- 2205 {{than those of the}} reference compounds.

40|$|AbstractTopical agents {{containing}} vitamin D 3 (VD 3) analogues such as calcipotriol, maxacalcitol and <b>tacalcitol</b> and {{the combination}} of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (betamethasone) are prescribed for patients with psoriasis. However, they are known to occasionally cause hypercalcemia, {{and the frequency of}} hypercalcemia is suggested to vary according to the VD 3 analogue used. In this study, to address the reason for these differences, the calcemic effects of maxacalcitol-, calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments in rats were evaluated. The serum calcium levels in rats treated with ointments containing maxacalcitol, but not calcipotriol or calcipotriol/betamethasone, were significantly elevated, which is consistent with clinical observations. The serum concentration of VD 3 analogue in rats treated with ointments containing calcipotriol and calcipotriol/betamethasone was lower than that in rats treated with maxacalcitol-containing ointment. Thus, the calcemic effects appear {{to be associated with the}} systemic exposure of VD 3 analogues in rats. To understand the mechanism underlying the different systemic exposures of VD 3 analogues, skin permeation and metabolic stability of VD 3 analogues were evaluated. The cumulative amount of calcipotriol permeated through rat skin was significantly lower than that of maxacalcitol. On the other hand, the metabolic clearance of calcipotriol in rat hepatocytes was higher than that of maxacalcitol. Similar results were obtained using human skin and human hepatocytes. The current study demonstrates that the lower calcemic effects of calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments are caused by the low systemic exposure of calcipotriol according to low skin permeability and rapid hepatic elimination after topical application...|$|E

Two primary fibroblast cultures were established from nasal polyp tissues obtained during surgery. The nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; 10  ng/mL) for 24 hours, followed by replacement with media alone or with vitamin D derivatives (calcitriol or tacalcitol; 10 μM) and incubated for another 24 hours. After the treatments, the levels of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 secreted were evaluated by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immunogenetic disorder. Factor XIIIa+ dermal dendrocytes (DD) {{are part}} of the pathobiological changes in the plaque type of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at {{comparing}} the effect of 3 vitamin D(3) derivatives on the epidermis, microvasculature and DD in psoriasis. METHOD: Twenty men suffering from chronic plaques of psoriasis on the trunk were enrolled in this study. They applied twice a day for 3 weeks calcipotriol, <b>tacalcitol</b> and calcitriol, each to one plaque. Another similar lesion received petrolatum as a placebo treatment. Skin biopsies were taken at entry and at completion of the 3 -week treatment phase. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the lectin of Ulex europaeus and an antibody to factor XIIIa. Computerized image analysis served to measure the stratum Malpighii area, the microvasculature area and the DD numerical density in the papillary dermis. RESULTS: At entry in the study, the 4 test sites were indistinguishable with regard to the stratum Malpighii area, the papillary microvasculature area and the papillary DD density. The 3 histometric parameters appeared correlated with each other. At completion of the 3 -week treatment phase, the 3 vitamin D derivatives had decreased the size of the stratum Malpighii. In addition, calcitriol had also reduced the DD density in the papillary dermis. No other significant changes were yielded. CONCLUSION: As assessed by histometry, the psoriatic epidermis responded to a short treatment using the 3 vitamin D derivatives. The better result compared to the control site was achieved by calcitriol. DD appeared to be most controlled by the same drug.

Analysis was performed on pooled 8 -week safety data from nine clinical trials evaluating once-daily Cal/BD treatment of scalp (n = 6) and body (n = 3) psoriasis. Pharmacovigilance data were also assessed. Patients were treated with Cal/BD [n = 1953 (scalp), n = 824 (body) ], betamethasone dipropionate gel (BD; n = 1214, n = 562), calcipotriol gel (Cal; n = 979, n = 175), gel vehicle (VEH; n = 173, n = 226), calcipotriol scalp solution [n = 104 (scalp only) ] and <b>tacalcitol</b> ointment [TAC; n = 184 (body only) ]. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild-moderate severity. The proportion of scalp psoriasis patients with >/= 1 AE was lowest with Cal/BD (35 % versus 38 - 57 %). A similar proportion was found with Cal/BD for body psoriasis (32 %), however, lower proportions were reported with BD (24 %) and Cal (29 %). The most common AEs with Cal/BD included nasopharyngitis, pruritus and upper respiratory tract infection (2 - 5 % of patients). Overall, only 5 % of patients treated with Cal/BD reported >/= 1 lesional/perilesional AEs: the lowest incidence versus scalp comparators (6 - 19 %) and second lowest to BD (3 %) for body psoriasis. Similarly, Cal/BD treatment resulted in the lowest incidence of >/= 1 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in scalp psoriasis patients (8 % versus 9 - 27 %) and second lowest to BD (6 % versus 4 %) for body psoriasis. Overall, incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) was low (0 - 1 %). Data received postmarketing through spontaneous reporting revealed that SAEs reported more than once with Cal/BD treatment were psoriasis (n = 5); and alopecia, erythrodermic psoriasis, pruritus, skin atrophy and urticaria (n = 2 each). In this large subset of patients treated with Cal/BD, incidence of AEs and ADRs is consistently low.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{mechanism}} of 1 a, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1 a, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3) induced apoptosis was investigated in human keratinocytes. This was done with different methods at distinct cellular levels. It could be demonstrated that 1 a, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 mediated its effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human keratinocytes via upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a gene expression. After treatment of cells with 1 a, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 increased TNF a mRNA is detected, which is then translated into protein. TNF a protein is secreted and it affects the cell through an autocrine mechanism via the 55 kDa receptor. When cells are preincubated with neutralizing antibodies against the 55 kDa TNF a -receptor, the 1 a, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 induced inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis are partially blocked. TNF a leads to sphingomyelin hydrolysis in HaCaT cells, whereby ceramide is generated, which as a second messenger transduces the signal into the cell. The reduction of the basal ceramide concentration with fumonisin B 1, a specific inhibitor of an enzyme in the ceramide biosynthesis, the sphinganin- N -acyltransferase, antagonizes 1 a, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 -induced apoptosis. Exogenously applied cellpermeable ceramide analogues such as C 2 -Cer=O (N -acetylsphingosine), C 2 -Cer=S (N -thioacetylsphingosine) and FS- 5 (4 -dodecanoylamino-decan- 5 -ol) lead also to inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis in HaCaT cells, whereas the analogues C 2 -Cer=O and C 2 -Cer=S are strong agonists and FS- 5 a weak agonist of the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis. The weak effect of FS- 5 could be most probably explained {{by the lack of}} the double bond between carbon atom 4 and 5 of the sphingosine backbone. In addition to 1 a, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 its analogues EB 1213, GS 1500, <b>Tacalcitol</b> and Calcipotriol were also tested in HaCaT cells. All four analogues caused sphingomyelin hydrolysis, whereas with EB 1213 the hydrolysis was detectable even after 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, the analogues were shown to be antiproliferativ and proapoptotic. Nevertheless, only EB 1213 could upregulate the mRNA for TNF a, which could be {{explained by the fact that}} the analogues have different promotor selectivity. </FONT...|$|E
40|$|Some steroids in {{the brain}} and {{peripheral}} nervous system have been shown to have neuroprotective effects but the knowledge is limited. The present study examines the effects of steroids including oxysterols, vitamin D and vitamin D analogs on cell viability/growth and steroidogenesis in the nervous system. Both 24 - and 27 -hydroxycholesterol reduced staurosporine-induced toxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells. In addition, 27 -hydroxycholesterol decreased the staurosporine-mediated induction of caspases, known to be important in apoptotic events. From the findings it may be concluded that effects of oxysterols on cellular viability are dependent on the concentration and on the type of oxysterol. 24 -Hydroxycholesterol was also found to attenuate oxidative stress both in SH-SY 5 Y cells and astrocytes. The results indicate that during some conditions, oxysterols may have neuroprotective effects. The vitamin D analogs <b>tacalcitol</b> and calcipotriol strongly reduced proliferation, cell viability and migration of human glioblastoma T 98 G cells, similarly as 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, the physiological form of vitamin D. Glioblastoma is the most lethal type of primary tumors in the CNS. These findings suggest that vitamin D analogs are potential candidates in treatment of brain tumors, most likely in combination with other therapies. Astrocytes were found to be a major site for expression of 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD) whereas expression of CYP 17 A 1 was found in both astrocytes and neurons. 3 β-HSD and CYP 17 A 1 are important steroidogenic enzymes. Vitamin D inhibited both CYP 17 A 1 - and 3 β-HSD -mediated activity and mRNA levels, with a stronger effect on mRNA expression than on enzyme activity. This indicates that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 could affect the production of sex hormones {{in the brain}}. In summary, results from this thesis contribute to the knowledge on the effects of oxysterols on cell viability and oxidative stress in cells from the CNS. Also the results provide data on the effects of vitamin D {{in the brain and}} suggest that vitamin D analogs may be promising candidates for treatment of certain brain tumors...|$|E
40|$|Healthcare {{providers}} {{and policy makers}} are faced with an ever-increasing number of medical publications. Searching for relevant information and keeping up to date with new research findings remains a constant challenge. It has been widely acknowledged that narrative reviews of the literature are susceptible to several types of bias and a systematic approach may protect against these biases. The aim of this thesis was to apply quantitative methods {{in the assessment of}} outcomes of topical therapies for psoriasis. In particular, to systematically examine the comparative efficacy, tolerability and cost-effectiveness of topical calcipotriol in the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Over the years, a wide range of techniques have been used to evaluate the severity of psoriasis and the outcomes from treatment. This lack of standardisation complicates the direct comparison of results and ultimately the pooling of outcomes from different clinical trials. There is a clear requirement for more comprehensive tools for measuring drug efficacy and disease severity in psoriasis. Ideally, the outcome measures need to be simple, relevant, practical, and widely applicable, and the instruments should be reliable, valid and responsive. The results of the meta-analysis reported herein show that calcipotriol is an effective antipsoriatic agent. In the short-tenn, the pooled data found calcipotriol to be more effective than calcitriol, <b>tacalcitol,</b> coal tar and short-contact dithranol. Only potent corticosteroids appeared to have comparable efficacy, with less short-term side-effects. Potent corticosteroids also added to the antipsoriatic effect of calcipotriol, and appeared to suppress the occurrence of calcipotriol-induced irritation. There was insufficient evidence to support any large effects in favour of improvements in efficacy when calcipotriol is used in combination with systemic therapies in patients with severe psoriasis. However, there was a total absence of long-term morbidity data on the effectiveness of any of the interventions studied. Decision analysis showed that, {{from the perspective of the}} NHS as payer, the relatively small differences in efficacy between calcipotriol and short-contact dithranol lead to large differences in the direct cost of treating patients with mildto-moderate plaque psoriasis. Further research is needed to examine the clinical and economic issues affecting patients under treatment for psoriasis in the UK. In particular, the maintenance value and cost/benefit ratio for the various treatment strategies, and the assessment of patient's preferences has not yet been adequately addressed for this chronic recurring disease...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} of vitamin D actions in the brain and bone. In this study, the metabolism of vitamin D and its regulation in various cell cultures of the nervous and skeletal systems were examined. Human osteosarcoma Saos- 2 cells, human primary osteoblasts (hOB) and murine motor neuron-like NSC- 34 cells were found to express mRNA for all enzymes required in vitamin D 3  metabolism as well as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that mediates vitamin D actions. Also, production of 24, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3  was found in these cells. Studies on vitamin D metabolism in NSC- 34 cells and in primary neuron-enriched cells from rat cerebral cortex indicate formation of a previously unknown major metabolite formed from 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3. Evaluation of the NSC- 34 cells suggests that this cell line could be a novel model for studies of neuronal vitamin D metabolism and its regulation by endogenous and exogenous compounds. Treatment with glucocorticoids down regulated mRNA expression for the CYP 24 A 1 gene in Saos- 2 and hOB cells. Additionally, the glucocorticoid prednisolone showed suppression of CYP 24 A 1 -mediated metabolism and CYP 24 A 1 promoter activity in Saos- 2 cells. In NSC- 34 cells, CYP 24 A 1 mRNA levels were up-regulated by prednisolone, 1 α, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3  and its synthetic analogues, EB 1089 and <b>tacalcitol.</b> Formation of an endogenous glucocorticoid, 11 -deoxycortisol, was observed in Saos- 2 cells. Effects of glucocorticoids on the vitamin D system in bone cells may contribute to the adverse side effects in long-term treatment with glucocorticoids. Also, there may be a correlation between the administration of corticosteroids and adverse effects in the CNS. Expression and effects of vitamin D on steroidogenic enzymes were studied in primary neuron-enriched rat cortex cells, primary rat astrocytes and human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells. These different cell cultures all expressed CYP 17 A 1, whereas only astrocytes expressed 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD). 1 α, 25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D 3  suppressed mRNA levels and enzyme activity of CYP 17 A 1 in SH-SY 5 Y cells and astrocytes. 1 α, 25 -Dihydroxyvitamin D 3  suppressed enzyme activity and mRNA levels of 3 β-HSD in astrocytes. The results suggest that vitamin D-mediated regulation of CYP 17 A 1 and 3 β-HSD {{may play a role in}} the nervous system. The results presented here contribute to our understanding of vitamin D metabolism and effects of glucocorticoids in the brain and bone...|$|E
40|$|Las funciones que realiza la vitamina D 3 pueden tener lugar a través de la interacción con su {{receptor}} nuclear (respuestas genómicas) o con un receptor de membrana (respuestas no genómicas). Los estudios realizados hasta la fecha no han aclarado el mecanismo por el que transcurren las funciones no genómicas. Sin embargo, existe un conocimiento mayor de aquellas actividades que tienen lugar a través del receptor de la vitamina D (VDR) y esto ha servido como base para varias aplicaciones terapéuticas. El uso de la hormona calcitriol como fármaco frente a enfermedades como la osteoporosis, psoriasis, osteodistrofia renal, raquitismo y diversos tipos de cáncer (próstata, mama, leucemia), está muy limitado {{debido a}} los efectos calcémicos que produce (hipercalcemia) entre los que se encuentra la calcificación de los tejidos blandos. Esto es lo que ha promovido la búsqueda de nuevos análogos de la 1 α, 25 - (OH) 2 -D 3 con un bajo poder calcificante y que conserven o incrementen los efectos terapéuticos. A pesar de los grandes avances logrados en el tratamiento de estas enfermedades, que mejoraron la calidad de vida y alargaron la supervivencia en algunos tipos de cáncer, aún resulta muy necesario profundizar la búsqueda de terapias novedosas evaluando nuevos compuestos. En la presente tesis, se han sintetizado una biblioteca de análogos diasteroisómeros con un anillo de oxolano en la cadena lateral, para ello nos hemos basado en antecedentes bibliográficos de Moras y Col. 2008 que muestran indicios de que optimizar la cadena lateral con este tipo de estructuras exhiben resultados superagonistas sin ejercer toxicidad. También se han desarrollado ensayos biológicos de los mismos, con unos resultados prometedores en cuanto a su toxicidad y efectos antineoplásicos. Por otro lado, también se ha querido diseñar una nueva estrategia sintética para análogos hidroxilados en la posición C 24, de manera que se pueda acceder de forma sencilla y rápida a este tipo de compuestos. Se sabe que la hidroxilación en esta posición es el primer paso para la degradación metabólica de la vitamina D 3. Las funciones biológicas de estos metabolitos no han sido muy estudiados debido a la dificultad de acceso a estos compuestos. En la actualidad se pueden encontrar en el mercado el <b>tacalcitol</b> y calcipotriol utilizados con éxito en el tratamiento de la psoriasis. Vitamin D is one the oldest hormones present in primitive life forms {{and which has}} lasted more than 750 million years. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and most plants and animals which are exposed to solar rays, possess the capacity to synthesize it. Its presence in the organism is of vital importance. Vitamin D 3 or cholecalciferol, through its active form, the 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3 or calcitriol, carries out {{the vast majority of}} its biological functions, standing out in this way the intestinal absorption of calcium and thus facilitating the mineralization of the bones. These are the classical functions of the 1 α, 25 - (OH) 2 -D 3 which are carried out in the cells go the intestine, bone, kidney and parathyroid gland. In addition to these classical functions, vitamin D 3 possess other functions (notclassical) where other organs and systems are implicated, as shows the fact that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in different cell tissues (skin, skeleton, digestive tract, heart, lungs, immune system, colon, etc.), 2 amongst these the cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and the regulation of the immune system are highlighted. It is the non-classical activities which are having a high index search of new analogues, from a chemical point of view as from a pharmacological one. The functions that vitamin D 3 carry out through the interaction with its nuclear receptor (genomic responses) or with a membrane receptor (non-genomic responses). The research carried out, up to date, not explained the mechanism through which the non-genomic functions elapse. However, the bibliography shows a bigger knowledge of those activities which take place through the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and this has served as a base for several therapeutic applications. In spite of the great advances gained in the treatment of these diseases, the survival/rate has increased in some types of cancer, therefore it is fundamental to Delve into the search for new therapies to evaluate new compounds. In this thesis, a library of diasteromic analogues have been synthesized with an oxolane moiety in their side chains. This is based on bibliographical precedents Moras y col. 2008 where the show evidence that optimizing the side chain with these types of structures show superagonist results without toxicity or low toxicity. Moreover, biological tests of the same have been developed with promising results regarding its toxicity and its antineoplasic interest. On the other hand, we have also wanted to design a new synthetic strategy for hydroxylated analogues in the C 24 position, so we can access in a simple and efficient way to this type of compounds. It is known that hydroxylation in this position is the first step for the metabolic degradation of vitamin D 3 and the biological functions of these metabolites have not been studied in detail {{due to the lack of}} suitable synthetic methods. At present, the synthetic analogues <b>tacalcitol</b> and calcipotriol are sold for the treatment of psoriasis...|$|E
