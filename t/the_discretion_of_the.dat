5|$|New {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the passing of the Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document.|$|E

5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered.

Larger wings may have an optional subordinate echelon of groups, at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing commander. Each Group encompasses at least five squadrons or flights.|$|E
5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within the {{parameters}} of a rhythmic mode is a must. As with gamelan orchestras, each kulintang mode {{has a kind of}} theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This occurs at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} non-political Lords-in-Waiting are also appointed, {{as well as}} Permanent Lords-in-Waiting, who are usually retired senior {{officials}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Household. These, being non-political, are at <b>the</b> personal <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign. For example, Lord Janvrin who was, until 2007, the Private Secretary to the Queen, was installed upon his retirement as a life peer in <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Lords and serves as one of Her Majesty's Permanent Lords-in-Waiting.|$|R
50|$|Board {{members are}} {{appointed}} at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> and by <b>the</b> permanent secretary.

Notable examples of Scottish criminal proceedings which have been filmed, in whole or in part, include; HMA v Al Megrahi and Fhimah, Megrahi v HMA, Fraser v HMA, and HMA v Fraser (2012).|$|R
5|$|A PIL {{was filed}} in the Karnataka High Court where in the {{petitioner}} requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple {{times in the past}} and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest authority in the Government.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E
5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to <b>the</b> subjective <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted <b>the</b> executive's <b>discretion</b> to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive's rationale and explanations.|$|R
50|$|Governor Togiola Tulafono {{appointed}} Liamatua as Secretary of Samoan Affairs on January 7, 2009. He succeeded outgoing Secretary Mauga Tasi Asuega.

5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Queen Victoria in 1901 {{are regarded as}} heirlooms owned by the Queen in right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added to that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Collection at <b>the</b> sole <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarch. It {{is not possible to}} say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|R
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E
5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at <b>the</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} in 1957 of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) created new duplicate institutions to the ECSC (except for the Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice, which were shared). On 7 January 1958, {{it was decided}} that Brussels, Luxembourg, and Strasbourg would again be provisional venues until a final decision. Strasbourg would retain the Assembly, Luxembourg the Court and both Brussels and Luxembourg would host meetings of the Councils and Commissions (or High Authority). <b>The</b> <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exact meeting place of the new Councils was given to the President of the Council. In practice, this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it would move to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels. Meanwhile, the ECSC Council was still based in Luxembourg, holding its meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved within the city on numerous occasions, but between 1955 and 1967, it was housed in the Verlorenkost district.|$|E
50|$|According to English and Welsh procedure, {{the jury}} has no power to {{determine}} the punishment to be awarded for an offense. The sentence, with certain exceptions in capital cases, is within <b>the</b> sole <b>discretion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judge, subject to the statutory prescriptions as to the kind and maximum of punishment. It is common practice for juries to add to their verdict, guilty or not guilty, a rider recommending the accused to mercy on <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> grave provocation received, or other circumstances which in their view should mitigate the penalty.|$|R
