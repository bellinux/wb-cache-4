Norman then goes to meet with Hammerhead, revealing that he helped them steal the suit from Tri-Corp as they are his company's competitor.

5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E

25|$|Howard {{reported}} to camp {{for his second}} NBA season having added 20 pounds of muscle during the off-season. Orlando coach Brian Hill—responsible for grooming former Magic superstar Shaquille O'Neal—decided that Howard should be converted into a full-fledged center. Hill identified two areas where Howard needed to improve: his post-up game, and his defense. He exerted extra pressure on Howard, saying that the Magic would need him to emerge as a force in the middle before the team had a chance at the playoffs. Even though <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> played tentatively at times, {{he was able to}} build on his strong rookie year with an impressive sophomore season. On November 15, 2005, in a home game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Howard scored 21 points and 20 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to score 20 or more points and gather 20 or more rebounds in the same game. He was selected to play on the Sophomore Team in the 2006 Rookie Challenge during the All-Star break, and on April 15, 2006, he recorded a career-high 26 rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers; his 28 points in that game also brought him close to an NBA rarity, a 30–30 game. Overall, he averaged 15.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, ranking second in the NBA in rebounds per game, offensive rebounds, and double doubles; and sixth in field goal percentage. Despite Howard's improvement, the Magic finished the season with a 36–46 win-loss record and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the second consecutive season since Howard's arrival.|$|E

500|$|In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon {{opened his}} first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players {{the finer points}} of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> plays the right way. On defense, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, {{make it easier for the}} entire team." [...] He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. [...] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.|$|E

The story was broken by The Sunday Mirror; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as [...] "secret", while writers for The Daily Mail claimed that the lessons were [...] "likely to upset fellow contestants", and were evidence that Smith was [...] "already being groomed for stardom". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but {{she and her family}} turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said [...] "We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> says your daughter is special, you listen."

Brought back to Dublin for regular check-ups, one day Murphy asked his father if he could go into Croke Park.

Ó Muircheartaigh shook the hand of young Murphy and asked him did he [...] "know <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> – Anthony Molloy?" [...] Murphy said, [...] "I do. He's the captain of Donegal."

A double turn took place as Demolition turned face while the Powers of Pain turned heel. Interviewed after the contest, Fuji claimed that he had turned on Demolition because, since winning the championship, they had become insubordinate and disrespectful towards him, whereas the Powers would be utterly obedient and loyal apprentices. [...] For their part, Demolition denounced their former manager as a parasite, labelling him [...] "Fuj the Stooge." [...] Ax and Smash also memorably squared off against each other as entrants #1 and #2 in the Royal Rumble match at the Summit in Houston in 1989, tearing into {{each other for the}} full two minutes before being joined in the ring by the third entrant André the Giant, where they once again joined as Demolition and targeted <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When O'Neal {{arrived at}} his new club, new coach Isiah Thomas—who had pushed for the O'Neal/Davis trade—told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed. At that time, Indiana was {{rebuilding}} and still revolved around veteran All-Star Reggie Miller. [...] O'Neal {{turned out to be}} a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team. Starting in 80 of the 81 regular season games he played in for the 2000–01 season, his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> helped his team to a 41–41 record and the eighth playoff seed; he also led the league in total blocks (228, a franchise record), and led the Eastern Conference in double doubles. O'Neal kept up his form into the playoffs as well, averaging almost 9.8 points and 12.5 boards a game in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers, although the series was short-lived as the latter emerged victorious in four games.|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal {{was given}} jersey #6 for the Raptors since his number with the Pacers (#7) was already owned by Andrea Bargnani. While he was {{expected}} to combine with Toronto's three-time All-Star Chris Bosh to form a strong frontcourt and provide greater rebounding and interior defense for the Raptors, O'Neal's arrival was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk; in the team's second game, Toronto's center blocked a dunk from Golden State's Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say [...] "Don't come back here again." [...] Even so, it took O'Neal some time to find his offensive game: he reached the 20-point mark just twice in his first 23 games, before notching three straight thereafter. By the All-Star break, injuries had ruled <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> out for almost a quarter of Toronto's games, while Bargnani regained his starting spot with a streak of solid performances. This, coupled with the Raptors entering the break placed 14th in the conference and 13 games under [...]500, Toronto General Manager Bryan Colangelo looked to move O'Neal to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space.|$|E
