5|$|The Imperial {{government}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> {{the church}} and appointed a series of well educated, reforming bishops. Although these bishops agreed with the government on the need <b>to</b> <b>reform,</b> they did not share Pedro II's views on the subservience of the Church to government and tended {{to be influenced by}} Ultramontanism which emphasised loyalty to the Papacy over loyalty to the civil powers.|$|E

5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E

At the same time, Isabella and the Fireside Girls are starting the stage building. Lawrence, at the same time, tries to cater a small dinner and hires a singing telegram; unfortunately, the dinner catches fire, and Lawrence's hastily planned evening goes up in smoke. Phineas and Ferb arrive and assure Lawrence that all is well, explaining that the band has agreed <b>to</b> <b>reform.</b> Meanwhile, Candace continues keeping Linda {{away from the house}} by taking her to the mall to try on some dresses.|$|E

5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> the welfare system, adding {{changes such as}} work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E

5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} he took <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> {{the government of}} the empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
5|$|Archduke Charles, {{brother of}} the Austrian Emperor, had started <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council {{responsible}} for decisionmaking in the Austrian armed forces. Charles was Austria's best field commander, but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria {{decided to go to}} war with France.|$|E

With her support, in 1764 he was elected king of Poland. Against expectations, he attempted <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> and strengthen the ailing Commonwealth. His efforts met with external opposition from Prussia, Russia and Austria, all interested in keeping the Commonwealth weak; and from internal conservative interests, which saw reforms as threatening their traditional liberties and prerogatives.|$|E

Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims of press gangs, and those unjustly accused of violating the game laws.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke.

The Russian infantry had started <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded.

Next, the agency sought <b>to</b> <b>reform</b> land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
