5|$|A Congressman named David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) {{visits the}} club and becomes {{infatuated}} with Erin. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin {{with a plan to}} manipulate the congressman to settle the custody battle and help her get Angela back. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

25|$|In Ireland the {{granting}} of arms to Irish citizens or to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> prove Irish ancestry {{is considered to be}} a cultural tradition which is allowed through the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. This Office was established under the English Crown in 1552 as the Ulster King of Arms and was converted to the Chief Herald's Office after the 1937 Constitution of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|About 111 verses were {{translated}} into English Rhyme {{and published by}} Arbab Hidayatullah, himself a Ghoryakhel Mohmand, in 2009. The original Pashto version has been transliterated into the Roman alphabet {{in order to make}} it easier to read for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> not read the Pashto alphabet. This translation, with a tilt to the romantic side of Rahman Baba's poetry, has been very well received.|$|E

25|$|The high {{morale of}} the Arab fighters and {{politicians}} was not shared by the Palestinian Arab civilian population. The UN Palestine Commission reported 'Panic continues to increase, however, throughout the Arab middle classes, {{and there is a}} steady exodus of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford to leave the country. 'From December 1947 to January 1948, around 70,000 Arabs fled, and, by the end of March, that number had grown to around 100,000.|$|E
25|$|Since it puts {{a premium}} on {{conscious}} understanding of the case, the party restricts membership to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> pass a membership test on the party’s policies and principles. For example, the satirist John Bird is quoted as saying, I {{was a member of}} something called the Socialist Party of Great Britain at school for a while. You had to pass an exam, you know. You could not just join.|$|E
25|$|UNRWA {{has taken}} very few steps {{to detect and}} {{eliminate}} terrorists {{from the ranks of}} its staff or its beneficiaries, and no steps at all to prevent members of organizations such as Hamas from joining its staff. UNRWA has no preemployment security checks and does not monitor off-time behavior to ensure compliance with the organization's anti-terror rules. No justification exists for millions of dollars in humanitarian aid going to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford to pay for UNRWA services.|$|E

25|$|Moscoe {{has called}} for Ontario's {{disabled}} parking system to be overhauled, arguing that the current system is both outdated and rampant with abuse. He says that many non-disabled Ontarians are currently using disabled parking permits for convenience purposes. In a letter published in the Toronto Star in February 2007, Moscoe argues that subsidies should be provided to the disabled poor, rather than to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford their own and drive a car.|$|E
25|$|Visitors to Panama {{require a}} visa {{unless they are}} {{citizens}} {{of one of the}} eligible countries who do not require a visa for up to 180 days. All visitors must hold a passport valid for 3 months. On December 28, 2016, President Juan Carlos Varela decreed that the immigration authorities of the National Immigration Service will issue tourist visas valid for a term not greater than 90 days (three months), however it was later clarified that did not change the situation for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> enter visa-free for 180 days.|$|E
25|$|In Hungary, the police, {{the public}} {{prosecutor}} or the court (depending on what individual cases require) appoints a criminal defender at the state's cost to defend <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> not afford a chosen lawyer. The defence counsel's participation {{is required by}} the Criminal Procedure Act. Usually a private lawyer is appointed, one for each defendant, and conflict of interest between contradicting suspects is avoided, e.g. the same lawyer may not represent two accused whose evidence is mutually contradictory. If convicted, the defendant is in principle liable for the fee, but is rarely pursued.|$|E

25|$|In the {{lowlands}} of Luzon, the Tagalog nobility {{were known as}} the maginoo. Like the Visayans, the Tagalog had a three-class social structure consisting of the alipin (commoners, serfs, and slaves), the maharlika (warrior nobility), and finally the maginoo. Like the tumao, only <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> claim royal descent {{were included in the}} maginoo class. Their prominence depended on the fame of their ancestors (bansag) or their wealth and bravery in battle (lingas). Generally, the closer a maginoo lineage is to the royal founder (puno) of a lineage (lalad), the higher their status.|$|E
25|$|Other {{individuals}} {{have questioned the}} assumptions that link systems of organ gifting with the equitable distribution of human organs arguing that the voluntary and altruistic donation of organs does not necessarily imply the free transplantation of that organ. In other words, under current systems of healthcare in the U.S., not only are organ donations managed by private {{organizations such as the}} United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), but organ transplantation is provided only to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford it and in rare cases to those who desperately need it.|$|E
25|$|For {{some years}} after the Iranian Revolution, {{transgender}} people were classified by the Judiciary as being homosexual and were thus {{subject to the same}} laws. However, in the mid-1980s the Judiciary began changing this policy and classifying transgender individuals as a distinct group, separate from homosexuals, granting them legal rights. Gender dysphoria is officially recognized in Iran today, and the Judiciary permits sexual reassignment surgery for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford it. In the early 1960s, Ayatollah Khomeini had issued a ruling permitting gender reassignment, which has since been reconfirmed by Ayatollah Khamenei.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox Christians who are {{preparing}} to receive the Eucharist do not eat or drink at all from vespers (sunset) until after taking Holy Communion. A similar total fast {{is expected to be}} kept on the Eve of Nativity, the Eve of Theophany (Epiphany), Great Friday and Holy Saturday for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> do so. There are other individual days observed as fasts (though not as days of total fasting) no matter what day of the week they fall on, such as the Beheading of St. John the Baptist on 29 August and the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E

To show the kids {{the importance of}} sports and sportsmanship, Feyenoord invite the children to De Kuip to see what sport can do to people: happiness, disappointment, excitement, emotions, fear and cosines, it brings people together. In Feyenoord's Youth Project visiting a match is the central point, {{but there is also}} an educative and cultural character included. Feyenoord provide schools and amateur clubs with small teaching books and expect these to be filled in by the visiting youth when they enter the stadium on a match day.
