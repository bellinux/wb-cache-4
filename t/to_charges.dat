5|$|After partial {{recovery}} from his lengthy heart surgery, Vladimir Bukovsky responded <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> brought against {{him by the}} UK Crown Prosecution Service earlier in the year. Issuing a High Court writ for libel, Vladimir Bukovsky said that the CPS had defamed him, and claimed damages of £100,000. Bukovsky's attempt to sue the CPS for libel failed in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 2017 KFC {{was fined}} £950,000 after two workers were scalded by boiling hot gravy. The company {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of failing in a {{duty of care}} to employees, and was ordered by Teesside Crown Court to pay fines of £800,000 and £150,000.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{and wife}} Sandi signed plea {{agreements}} in early February 2013. Jackson Jr. agreed {{to plead guilty}} <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of fraud, conspiracy, making false statements, mail fraud, wire fraud, and criminal forfeiture—having used about $750,000 in campaign money for over 3000 personal purchases that included a Michael Jackson fedora and cashmere capes.|$|E

50|$|It is {{currently}} illegal <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> impact taxes {{in certain areas}} of Virginia. The state government passed a law to limit the option for localities <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> impact taxes. The population of the county determines {{whether or not they}} are permitted <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> the taxes. <b>To</b> check out Virginia's policy on income taxes go to the Code of Virginia at Virginia's Legislative Information System (LIS) http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+15.2-2242.|$|R
50|$|Tesla {{supercharging}} stations <b>charge</b> with up <b>to</b> 145 kW {{of power}} distributed between two adjacent cars, {{with a maximum}} of 120 kW per car. That is up to 16 {{times as fast as}} public charging stations; they take about 20 minutes <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>to</b> 50%, 40 minutes <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>to</b> 80%, and 75 minutes <b>to</b> 100%. The <b>charging</b> stations provide high-power direct-current (DC) <b>charging</b> power directly <b>to</b> the battery, bypassing the internal charging power supply. The next version of Supercharging is expected <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> with more than 350 kW.|$|R
5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over {{the merits of the}} early work on the hydrogen bomb project into a matter of a security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> by a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|By resubmitting the discredited treaty {{through a}} House-sponsored bill, the Tyler {{administration}} reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission. Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation {{in their home}} states during the 1844 presidential campaigns. Now, northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler's slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Fastow and his wife, Lea, both {{pleaded guilty}} <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> against them. Fastow was {{initially}} charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, and conspiracy, among other crimes. Fastow {{pleaded guilty to}} two charges of conspiracy {{and was sentenced to}} ten years with no parole in a plea bargain to testify against Lay, Skilling, and Causey. Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.|$|E

50|$|Epyon opened Europe’s first {{commercial}} fast-charging station in May 2010 in the Netherlands. The system can deliver 50 kilowatts of power <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> a nine-person taxi van in 30 minutes.Epyon’s system offers the ability <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> multiple vehicles {{at the same}} time, remote configuration, and an Internet-based system that lets Dutch utility Essent bill customers for use. The Netherlands-based station will be used <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> two nine-person taxi van EVs from local taxi company Kijlstra.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the Parliamentarian {{right wing}} of horse under Cromwell and the Royalist Northern Horse faced each other, neither willing <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>to</b> the aid of their {{infantry}} while the other could threaten their flank. Eventually after half an hour, the Royalist cavalry began <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> and Cromwell's troops moved to meet them. Langdale's men were not only outflanked and outnumbered two to one, but forced <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> up a slope broken up by bushes and a rabbit warren. After a brief contest they were routed.|$|R
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, {{and it took}} several days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
5|$|IRS {{officers}} raided Bell's home on April 1, 1997. He {{was arrested}} in May of that year, and, in July, he pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of obstruction of IRS agents {{and the use of}} a false Social Security number (officials alleged that he had used four such numbers since 1984 in order to conceal his assets; Bell said that he did not believe anyone had a right to know his real Social Security number).|$|E
5|$|Nixon, as he {{related in}} his address, {{came from a}} family of modest means, and had spent much of his time after law school either in the military, campaigning for office, or serving in Congress. After his {{successful}} 1950 Senate campaign, Nixon's backers continued to raise money to finance his political activities. These contributions went to reimburse him for travel costs, postage for political mailings which he did not have franked, and similar expenses. Such a fund was not illegal at the time, but, because Nixon had made a point of attacking government corruption, it exposed him <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> he might be giving special favors to the contributors.|$|E
50|$|Some devices can {{use their}} USB ports <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> {{built-in}} batteries, while other devices can detect a dedicated charger and draw more than 500 mA (0.5 A), allowing them <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> more rapidly. OTG devices are allowed to use either option.|$|R

5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto {{the wrong side of the}} road before colliding with a Renault Scénic. A {{passenger}} in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured. Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of riot and conspiracy to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony {{and the possibility that}} White had died from a pre-existing thrombotic condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect was}} to {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant’s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine’s purpose of rallying Protestants to the Republican party and promoting himself as one of the party’s foremost leaders.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the Contingency Fees Act, it is now {{possible}} for attorneys <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> on a contingency basis. The attorney and client may agree that the attorney will charge the client only if he succeeds in the case. If the client loses, he is not charged for fees by his own attorney. Owing to the risk involved, the Act allows the attorney <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> a larger amount than he would be entitled <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> if the matter were conducted on a normal basis.|$|R
5|$|The {{reign of}} Nyuserre Ini {{witnessed}} the unabated {{growth of the}} priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai. Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication {{in the number of}} titles, reflecting the creation of new administrative offices. These in turn, reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> attached to very specific duties.|$|E
5|$|Vincent Crabbe is a recurring, minor {{character}} who appears in every book and dies in a pivotal scene in Deathly Hallows. Jamie Waylett portrays the {{character in the}} first six films. During production of the seventh film, Waylett pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of growing marijuana. Joshua Herdman, who plays Crabbe's best friend Gregory Goyle, said in August 2009 that Waylett would not be reprising his role and Herdman's character would die instead.|$|E
5|$|While the Spruce Production Division {{was quickly}} demobilized after the war, {{there was some}} post-war {{controversy}} over the cost of its operations. Disque, by then a brigadier general, spent months answering <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> that his division had wasted taxpayers' money. Congress was particularly critical of the $4million spent on an unfinished railroad located in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. Disque responded that {{it was to be}} used for transporting spruce lumber. Eventually, the charges proved to be unfounded.|$|E
50|$|As for the {{charging}} patterns, the 2013 {{survey found that}} 85% of the respondents could charge in their own garage or parking lot, and 10% had access <b>to</b> <b>charging</b> in the shared apartment building where they live. This means that 95% {{of the respondents were}} able <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> their electric cars at home during the night. The survey showed that 59% of the respondents had access <b>to</b> <b>charging</b> where they work, and 48% at public charging stations in the area they normally use the electric car.|$|R

5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Jackson {{signed a}} three year, six million dollar {{contract}} with the Cleveland Indians. Jackson served as the primary setup man to closer José Mesa {{for the first half}} of the season, but took over the closer position while Mesa answered <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> of rape. Finishing the year with an 86–75 record, the Indians finished first in the American League Central and made the playoffs. After winning against the New York Yankees in the American League Divisional Series (ALDS) and the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Indians played in the World Series against the Florida Marlins. In the World Series, Jackson recorded an ERA of 1.93 over four games pitched, although the Indians lost the World Series, four games to three.|$|E
