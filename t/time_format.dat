500|$|... "Fragments" [...] {{was written}} {{to be in}} real <b>time</b> <b>format.</b> Kindler {{described}} the episode as a [...] "nice procedural, with heart," [...] that follows the same style as episodes of the medical drama ER, where [...] "stuff goes down {{and you have to}} kind of follow the team in different aspects and see how they're handling the situation." [...] The idea behind [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] came when Kindler and Wood noticed a rescue helicopter that was available for rent, prompting the two {{to come up with a}} [...] "helicopter story." [...] The episode also introduces a next level in Will and Magnus' friendship; arguments, which would create a [...] "far more realistic thread of tension" [...] between the two characters who [...] "obviously love each other," [...] and [...] "obviously get along," [...] which Kindler felt made a [...] "cool character layer." [...] This was also based on the producers themselves, who despite being good friends, often argue while producing the series.|$|E
500|$|Before filming took place, David-Lloyd {{met with}} Caroline Chikezie {{and got to}} know each other to help give their {{respective}} characters their chemistry. The episode was filmed as part of the third production block of the first series, along with eighth episode [...] "They Keep Killing Suzie". Director James Strong wanted to film the episode in a sort of real <b>time</b> <b>format.</b> Filming largely took place at the Upper Boat Studios outside Pontypridd, where the Torchwood Hub set is located. The scene where Jack threatens to kill Ianto if he does not kill Lisa was the first scene to be shot. The flashback scene where Ianto finds a half-converted Lisa in Canary Wharf took a full day to film; it was originally supposed to take only a few hours, but the camera failed to record the scene. It was replaced, but the second camera failed to record also. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a [...] "secret agent." [...] Strong noted that they both held the gun and torch in each hand like professionals.|$|E
