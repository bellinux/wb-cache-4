40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} long-time asymptotics of periodic (and {{slightly more}} generally of algebro-geometric finite-gap) solutions of the doubly infinite Toda lattice under a short-range perturbation. We {{prove that the}} perturbed lattice asymptotically approaches a modulated lattice. More precisely, let g be the genus of the hyperelliptic curve associated with the unperturbed solution. We show that, apart from {{the phenomenon of the}} solitons travelling on the quasi-periodic background, the n/t-pane contains g + 2 areas where the perturbed solution is close to a finite-gap solution on the same isospectral torus. In between <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>g</b> + 1 regions where the perturbed solution is asymptotically close to a modulated lattice which undergoes a continuous phase transition (in the Jacobian variety) and which interpolates between these isospectral solutions. In the special case of the free lattice (g = 0) the isospectral torus consists of just one point and we recover the known result. Both the solutions in the isospectral torus and the phase transition are explicitly characterized in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying hyperelliptic curve. Our method relies on the equivalence of the inverse spectral problem to a vector Riemann–Hilbert problem defined on the hyperelliptic curve and generalizes the so-called nonlinear stationary phase/steepest descent method for Riemann–Hilbert problem deformations to Riemann surfaces. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduced {{is a new}} {{inductive}} inference paradigm, dynamic modeling. Within this learning paradigm, for example, function h learns function g iff, in the i-th iteration, h and g both produce output, h gets the sequence of all outputs from g in prior iterations as input, g gets all the outputs from h in prior iterations as input, and, from some iteration on, the sequence of hʼs outputs will be programs for the output sequence of g. Dynamic modeling provides an idealization of, for example, a social interaction in which h seeks to discover program models of gʼs behavior it sees in interacting with g, and h openly discloses to g its sequence of candidate program models to see what g says back. Sample results: every g can be so learned by some h; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>g</b> {{that can only be}} learned by an h if g can also learn that h back; there are extremely secretive h which cannot be learned back by any g they learn, but which, nonetheless, succeed in learning infinitely many g; quadratic time learnability is strictly more powerful than linear time learnability.
