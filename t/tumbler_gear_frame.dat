50|$|One of the {{original}} designs, a fixed <b>gear</b> <b>frame</b> with 135mm rear dropout spacing and less aggressive geometry, intended for road use vs. on the track. These were lugged, and painted custard-yellow with black headtubes.|$|R
50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the change gears (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a quick change gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm <b>gears.</b> <b>Tumbler</b> <b>gears</b> (operated by H5) are provided between the spindle and gear train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|R

5000|$|In 1926, four Class FD Modified Fairlies entered service, {{designed}} and built by NBL in 1925. They had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> plate <b>frames</b> and were superheated.|$|R
50|$|Modern day aero bike {{comes with}} {{aerodynamic}} components such as aero wheels and aero helmets. Most brands also {{come with a}} combination of <b>gears,</b> carbon <b>framing</b> and strong durable wheels.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Greg {{was offered}} a spot on Team G Cross Honda, which used one-off {{internally}} <b>geared</b> <b>frames</b> made by Honda, with a Showa suspension. He accepted and stayed for four years, winning his second World Cup points series overall victory in 2005. The 2007 season ended on a bittersweet note with a dislocated and fractured shoulder early in his winning World Championship final run although Greg got back on the bike to salvage a painful 4th-place finish. In addition, Greg was forced to switch teams yet again when Honda {{pulled out of the}} sport and he chose the Santa Cruz Syndicate team, alongside riders Steve Peat, Nathan Rennie, and Josh Bryceland for the 2008 season.|$|R
50|$|A {{gear train}} is a {{mechanical}} system formed by mounting <b>gears</b> on a <b>frame</b> so {{the teeth of}} the gears engage.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{previous}} Mallet locomotive, these five had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> bar <b>frames</b> and used saturated steam. They differed little from {{the previous}} Mallet, basically only in respect of their larger boilers which made them slightly heavier and their tenders with a 1 lt 10 lcwt t larger coal capacity.|$|R
50|$|At the 1912 Olympia Motor Cycle and Cycle Car show Matchless {{showed a}} V-twin powered cycle car, with two wheels {{at the front}} and a single drive wheel at the rear. Unusually the drive was by shaft and bevel <b>gear.</b> The <b>frame</b> was of pressed steel channel. It was priced at 100 guineas.|$|R
5000|$|A fixed <b>gear</b> <b>frame,</b> with a cream color {{known as}} [...] "Kustard" [...] and the {{signature}} {{color of the}} mark, with 120mm rear dropout spacing. The G typified the eclectic nature of Koswell frames: steel frame and fork, with lugged joints, but a TIG-welded bottom bracket and threadless fork, melding both traditional styles (see Rivendell) and contemporary innovations. [...] The frame was built with road geometry, but used track dropouts and a narrow dropout spacing, which precluded installation of a derailleur or multi-speed hub. Fender and rack mounts, and generous clearances that allowed for wide tires and fenders both, signalled clearly that this bike {{was meant to be}} used on the road. But its unwillingness to slavishly imitate traditional designs and geometries, or outdated and inferior manufacturing techniques, set it apart from a retro style of other boutique manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Sparrow {{bicycles}} has a semi-upright riding position, silver grey color, {{male and}} female frame option, single or two-speed “kick-shift” <b>gearing</b> option, two <b>frame</b> size options.|$|R
50|$|With {{its wide}} range of <b>gearing</b> options, stiff <b>frame</b> and basic suspension, the Birdy is {{suitable}} not only for commuting but also for longer distance touring.|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, ten Class U Union Garratt {{locomotives}} {{were placed}} in service. The locomotives, designed and built by Maffei, were superheated and had Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and bar <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of items}} that are steel {{castings}} include: hydroelectric turbine wheels, forging presses, <b>gears,</b> railroad truck <b>frames,</b> valve bodies, pump casings, mining machinery, marine equipment, turbocharger turbines and engine cylinder blocks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1924, {{a single}} {{experimental}} Class FC Modified Fairlie entered service, {{designed and built}} by North British Locomotive Company (NBL). It had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> a plate <b>frame</b> and was superheated.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Heusinger-Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> bar <b>frames</b> {{and were}} superheated. They had round-topped fireboxes, unlike the earlier Modified Fairlie locomotives which had Belpaire fireboxes. They were fitted with the Parry soot-blower which enabled the boiler tubes {{to be cleaned}} during running conditions. Reversing was effected from the driver's cab by Hendrie's steam reversers. Provision was made for steam to either engine unit to be cut off in emergencies.|$|R
50|$|A {{fundamental}} issue with bicycle shaft-drive systems is {{the requirement to}} transmit the torque of the rider through bevel gears with much smaller radii than typical bicycle sprockets. This requires both high quality <b>gears</b> and heavier <b>frame</b> construction.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{applications}} for injection-molded POM include high-performance engineering components such as small <b>gear</b> wheels, eyeglass <b>frames,</b> ball bearings, ski bindings, fasteners, guns, knife handles, and lock systems. The material {{is widely used}} in the automotive and consumer electronics industry.|$|R
50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring <b>gears,</b> side <b>frames,</b> hoist motors, drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as toothed rims, require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed <b>gear.</b> <b>Frames</b> with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, power-operated reversing <b>gear,</b> American-style bar <b>frame</b> construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|R
50|$|The {{flagship}} bicycles Paula and Gustav have <b>gearing,</b> {{color and}} <b>frame</b> size options, Tom and Greta bicycles {{has the same}} Matt black colour, two-speed gearing and an option of the frame size. Paula and Greta have a female frame, Gustav and Tom - a male frame.|$|R
50|$|The Class FD was {{a heavier}} and more {{powerful}} version of the experimental Class FC which {{had been placed in}} service in 1925. It was the Modified Fairlie equivalent of the Class GD 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects, hence the Class FD designation of these Modified Fairlies. The FA and FB classifications were never used by the SAR. The Class FD locomotives had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> plate <b>frames</b> and were superheated. They proved to be powerful locomotives and good steamers, but they were less successful than their Garratt equivalent.|$|R
50|$|Gear {{trains are}} usually {{formed by the}} meshing {{engagement}} {{of two or more}} <b>gears</b> on a <b>frame</b> to form a transmission. This can provide translation (linear motion) or rotation as well as mechanically alter displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, direction and torque {{depending on the type of}} gears employed, transmission configuration and gearing ratio.|$|R
40|$|Identification of {{specific}} areas for the technology development; payload/facility requirements; crew safety {{as the highest}} priority for the space station; identification of preliminary operational constraints (facilities/experiments requiring specialized equipment and/or procedures, and crew limitations and protective <b>gear</b> requirements); <b>frame</b> of reference of baseline of applicable waste handling experience; use of the workshop {{as a basis for}} assessing the current and applicable space station requirements; provision of an educational, and informational forum for government employees, contractors, experimental facility developers, and potential hardware suppliers involved with the Space Station program; and documentation of workshop results and follow-on study issues are examined...|$|R
50|$|The NGR 2-6-6-0 Mallet {{locomotive}} had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> a bar <b>frame</b> {{and used}} saturated steam. It {{was the first}} articulated compound steam locomotive to enter service in South Africa and its design and large proportions represented a big advance in motive power on Cape gauge. At the time, {{it was the most}} powerful locomotive in the country.|$|R
5000|$|In Bed One Night and Other Brief Encounters, the {{shortest}} and slightest of Coover's fiction {{is an example}} of [...] "metafiction".Per Gass, metafictions are [...] "the forms of fiction (that) serve as the material upon which further forms can be imposed." [...] Coover's style causes the reader to shift one's <b>gears,</b> widen one's <b>frames,</b> and expand one's consciousness.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, the SAR placed two Class GH {{passenger}} train versions of its Class U Union Garratt in service, {{designed and built}} by Maffei, to work the named fast {{passenger train}}s of the era, the Union Express and Union Limited, forerunners of the Blue Train. They were superheated and had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> bar <b>frames</b> and mechanical stokers. They made several trips working the two Union trains out of Cape Town, {{but they were not}} as successful as had been hoped and they were soon taken off that duty. Their mechanical stokers also proved to be troublesome and were eventually removed. Both remained in service until 1958.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had round-topped fireboxes, Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and bar <b>frames.</b> To {{enable the}} longest boiler possible without increasing the overall {{length of the}} locomotive, the front engine unit was tucked in underneath the boiler frame somewhat further than was usual on a purebred Garratt locomotive. An additional underbelly water tank compensated for the resulting diminished water capacity of the front water bunker.|$|R
50|$|A raised relief on the Sarcophagus of {{a certain}} Marcus Aurelius Ammianos, a local miller, depicts the {{earliest}} known machine to incorporate a crank and connecting rod. On the pediment a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a <b>gear</b> train two <b>frame</b> saws cutting rectangular blocks by the way of connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks (see diagram). The accompanying inscription is in Greek.|$|R
50|$|Like their {{predecessor}} 40 Tonners, the 46 Tonners had Heusinger valve <b>gear,</b> outside plate <b>frames</b> {{and used}} saturated steam. The original {{design of the}} 46 Tonner called for a straight-backed coal bunker, but the last sixteen Esslingen-built and the twenty Werkspoor-built locomotives had bunkers that sloped outwards towards the top at the back, which increased the coal capacity by 20%. Their water tanks were also enlarged to a 10% larger capacity.|$|R
5000|$|The Dragonfly {{is made of}} {{lightweight}} materials that are strong and crash-resistant. Its <b>gears</b> and internal <b>frame</b> are made of Delrin. These parts, and its other internal electronics, are protected by a body molded from Expanded Polypropylene. Carbon fiber rods give the Dragonfly's wings strength, while Mylar film give them lift and thrust. [...] At 25 grams, its very light nature makes it easily susceptible to gentle wind currents.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, the Central South African Railways (CSAR) placed 36 Class 11 Mikados in service. Built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL), it was {{designed}} by P.A. Hyde, Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CSAR from 1902 to 1904, for goods train service on the Witwatersrand. It was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and plate <b>frame.</b> The Class 11 designation was retained when the CSAR was amalgamated into the SAR in 1912.|$|R
