5|$|Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival {{where it}} {{received}} the Golden Lion {{award for best}} picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the film's visual style and its empathy {{for a handful of}} characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{accepted}} the document {{and moved to}} the balcony to submit it directly to the people for ratification. But, because of the late hour and the weather, {{the number of people in}} the plaza had declined. Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to speak on behalf of the people. This wore <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the few who were still in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} of her resignation {{was met with}} speculation that San Miguel had been forced by Binibining Pilipinas pageant organizers to relinquish her title {{due to a lack}} of professionalism during preparatory training sessions, which strained <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> her mentors and superiors. In a later interview, she admitted that due to multiple conflicts in schedule she was unable to attend all the training sessions arranged for her by pageant organizers, which included sessions to improve her speaking ability. She also admitted to throwing a fit in the middle of a rehearsal when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and demanded that she be allowed to leave.|$|E

5|$|While the Polish {{king and}} the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action, <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> foreign powers was running out. Eventually, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands, bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński, was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw, where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm (the entire Polish parliament) to ratify the partition. In another sign of their influence, the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation (those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty, the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk). When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative was available save passive submission to their will. Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the foreign powers, with their forces commanded by the Austrian (or Russian, sources vary) general Abram Romanius (Abraham). On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene.|$|E

Their provocative behavior may potentially start flame wars (see below) or other disturbances.

25|$|An aging legacy-huntress named Philomela {{places her}} son and {{daughter}} with Eumolpus, ostensibly for education. Eumolpus makes love to the daughter, although because of his pretence of ill health he requires the help of Corax. Encolpius reveals that he has somehow been cured of his impotence (140). He warns Eumolpus that, because the wealth {{he claims to have}} has not appeared, <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the legacy-hunters is running out. Eumolpus's will is read to the legacy-hunters, who apparently now believe he is dead, and they learn they can inherit only if they consume his body.

25|$|While the Romans {{were busy}} raising an army and sorting out political/religious matters, Hannibal had marched in a leisurely manner south from Hartia. His army, rested, {{restored}} to health, retrained and re-equipped, cut {{a path of}} destruction through central Italy as they collected grain, cattle, provisions and supplies during the march. Hannibal followed the coastal plain before turning west. Near the town of Arpi, the Roman army under Fabius made contact with the Carthaginian army and camped at Aecae, six {{miles away from the}} Carthaginian camp. Hannibal drew up his army and offered battle, but Fabius ignored the offer and the Roman army remained in their camp. The stage was set for Fabius to reveal his plans, which would tax <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the Romans and the political clout of Fabius to the limit and ultimately be credited by later historians as the most prudent, if economically costly, strategy against the threat of Hannibal.|$|E
25|$|The {{refusal of}} Hadrian II to ordain a {{candidate}} approved by Boris exhausted <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the Bulgarian prince. After a three-month stay in Bulgaria Silvester returned to Rome {{with a letter}} to the Pope in which for the last time Boris I insisted that either Formosus or Marinus be ordained, but the Pope declined the proposal once again. During that time the Bulgarian ruler had already started negotiations with the Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatius, who was trying to improve the relations with Rome, which had been strained after the mutual anathemas made in 863 by his predecessor Photios I and Pope Nicolas I. Just like Photios, however, Ignatius did not want to allow a permanent establishment of the Roman Church in Bulgaria. In order to settle {{the differences between the two}} Churches, the Eighth Ecumenical Council was planned to be held in Constantinople in 869. After a long stay in Rome (868–869), Peter returned to Bulgaria and was immediately sent to participate in the council.|$|E
25|$|Journalists {{were able}} to play The Last Guardian at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 and the 2016 Tokyo Game Show {{in the months before}} the game's release, and several {{expressed}} further concerns {{about the nature of the}} game's lengthy development period. Patrick Garrett, writing for VG247, found that the visuals felt flat and aged considering modern hardware capabilities, and expressed concern that while older gamers would readily purchase the title, The Last Guardian may not draw in enough newer gamers to be a commercial success. Philip Kollar for Polygon, though still impressed with the characters, graphics, and core gameplay, found controlling the character difficult and managing the game's camera tricky, elements that made the game feel like a PlayStation 2 title rather than something on modern hardware. Wireds Chris Kohler found much of the demo to require patient observation of Trico's movements and puzzle solving, which, he commented, some players would appreciate but were elements that have slowly been phased out of action games over the last console generation, and other players may not have the patience for these. Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku also noted that the demo's pace was often set by how fast Trico would respond or react, which may test <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> players looking for a more action-based experience.|$|E

500|$|Placed under {{surveillance}} {{due to his}} involvement in revolutionary politics by 1894, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was eventually expelled from France, despite Huysmans' intervention in his favor. Reputedly, the deportation document identified him as a [...] "threat to public order". One urban legend recounts that Bogdan-Pitești was present at Vaillant's public execution and leaned over to kiss Vaillant's mangled body, which both disgusted and alarmed the judicial establishment. Zambaccian suggests {{that the decision to}} deport the Romanian provocateur was not politically motivated. He writes that Bogdan-Pitești had exhausted <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> French authorities by trafficking in stolen bicycles.|$|E
500|$|During {{his early}} years with the News, Grant was one of up to ten staff photographers, {{including}} Jack Beers, Tom Dillard, Doris Jacoby and Joe Laird. He gained a reputation for generosity as a mentor while with the newspaper, accompanying many young photographers on their early assignments; one of them later recalled that whenever the Morning News needed a feature photograph, they would send [...] "the trusty Clint Grant" [...] to the zoo to work with an animal. His evocative photographs often featured animals and children, and his editor said Grant's knack for putting subjects at ease came largely because he [...] "had <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> Job." ...|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Blue Lotus showed {{evidence}} of Hergé's [...] "left-wing counter-tendency" [...] that rejected his earlier right-wing worldview. He {{believed that this}} was {{partly due to the}} influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Hergé's [...] "European absolutism", and overall thought of it as [...] "the most visually rich of all the Tintin books". Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi– who was poisoned with Raijaijah– inverted [...] "the model of justice ruling the world of the Good". He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have [...] "feline suppleness, a devotion to good causes, and <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> an animal stalking its prey". He furthermore argued that Didi's desire to behead people when under the poison's influence expressed his Oedipus complex and was a substitute for castration.|$|E

[...] He gave the episode a grade of B. James Hunt for the website Den of Geek, watched the episode in November 2012.

500|$|Even {{during the}} second Cleveland administration, Americans took keen {{interest}} in the ongoing revolt in Cuba, then a Spanish colony. [...] Most Americans believed that Cuba should be independent and that Spain should leave the Western Hemisphere. [...] Beginning in 1895, Congress passed a number of resolutions calling for Cuban independence. [...] Although Cleveland pursued a policy of neutrality, his Secretary of State, Richard Olney, warned Spain that <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the United States was not inexhaustible. [...] Sherman, then a senator, favored neutrality but believed that the US would inevitably go to war over Cuba. [...] Soon after Hanna {{was appointed to the}} Senate, McKinley called Congress into special session to consider tariff legislation. [...] Despite the stated purpose of the session, a number of resolutions were introduced calling for independence for Cuba, by force if necessary. [...] When the press asked Hanna if he felt there would be action on Cuba during the session, he responded: [...] "I don't know. [...] You can't tell about that.

500|$|Ostensibly, the Staatsbewind did {{its part}} by prohibiting {{the import of}} all enemy goods on 5 July 1803. Later it banned cheese exports and butter. These {{gestures}} were, however, of little practical effect: in 1804 the volume of general exports to Britain was nearly equal {{to that in the}} last year of peace: 1802. British goods reached Dutch destinations via neutral German ports, or disguised as [...] "American cargo." [...] The republic was therefore an important [...] "keyhole into Europe" [...] that undermined the economic sanctions against Britain. As the members of the Staatsbewind, and their friends, often profited from this clandestine trade directly, <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> <b>of</b> the French was wearing thin. Matters came to a head when the French commander in the Republic, Auguste de Marmont, ordered in November 1804 that French naval patrols and customs officials were to take over the responsibility for the surveillance of cargoes in Dutch ports, with powers of confiscation without reference to Dutch authorities. This was the last straw for the Staatsbewind. On 23 November 1804, they forbade any Batavian official to take orders from the French.|$|E
