40|$|We {{summarise}} {{some recent}} results about nearby galactic bulges {{that are relevant}} to their formation. We highlight a number of significant advances in our understanding of the surface brightness profiles, stellar populations, and especially <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> spiral galaxies. We also view our own Milky Way {{as if it were an}} external galaxy. Our main conclusions are that bulges of earlytype spirals (S 0 – Sb) contain central nuclear components, just like late-type spirals and most other types of galaxies. The luminosities of these central components correlate best with total bulge luminosity, and not as well with morphological type. Bulges of early-type spiral galaxies follow the fundamental plane and the colour/line strength vs. luminosity relations of elliptical galaxies. Although we have a reasonable idea about bulges of early-type spirals we know much less about late-type bulges. However, the close resemblance of our Milky Way Bulge to bulges in external disk galaxies makes us suspect that bulges of late-type spirals might be very similar as well.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} Black Holes inevitably affects the distribution of dark and baryonic matter {{in the neighborhood of}} the Black Hole. These effects may be particularly relevant around Supermassive and Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs), the formation of which can lead to large Dark Matter overdensities, called spikes and mini-spikes respectively. Despite being larger and more dense, spikes evolve at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> galactic halos, in regions where numerous dynamical effects tend to destroy them. Mini-spikes {{may be more likely to}} survive, and they have been proposed as worthwhile targets for indirect Dark Matter searches. We review here the formation scenarios and the prospects for detection of mini-spikes, and we present new estimates for the abundances of mini-spikes to illustrate the sensitivity of such predictions to cosmological parameters and uncertainties regarding the astrophysics of Black Hole formation at high redshift. We also connect the IMBHs scenario to the recent measurements of cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra by the PAMELA, ATIC, H. E. S. S., and Fermi collaborations. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|Since {{globular}} clusters (GCs) are old, low-N systems their dynamics {{is widely believed}} to be fully dominated by collisional two-body processes, and their surface brightness profiles are fit by King models. However, for many GCs, especially those with HST-resolved central regions, and `extra-tidal' features, King models provide poor fits. We suggest that this is partly because collisionless dynamics is also important and contribute to shaping the cluster properties. We show using time-scale and length-scale arguments that except for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> clusters, collisionless dynamics should {{be more important than}} collisional. We then fit 38 GCs analyzed by Noyola and Gebhardt (2006) with (collisional) King and (collisionless) DARKexp models over the full available radial range, and find that the latter provide a better fit to 29 GCs; for six of these the fit is at least ~ 5 x better in term of rms. DARKexp models are theoretically derived maximum entropy equilibrium states of self-gravitating collisionless systems and have already been shown to fit the results of dark matter N-body simulations.

25|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the existence of blue stragglers.
