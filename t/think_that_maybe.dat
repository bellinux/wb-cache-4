5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) brings Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{along to}} a dinner party hosted by his friend Gavin Volure (Steve Martin). Gavin becomes {{intrigued}} by Liz and invites her to spend the weekend with him, which she accepts. She wonders how the relationship between them will work, as he is agoraphobic. Gavin explains his daily routines to Liz, and also discloses that due to his phobias, he cannot be intimate with women. Liz starts to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> a relationship with Gavin could work. As Liz gets ready to leave, Gavin admits {{to her that he}} is not agoraphobic, and that he is under house arrest for arson, fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering. This shocks Liz, and when she returns to New York, she tells Jack about it. Jack feels awful for investing NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) money with Gavin, after Gavin told him he was forming a new company and interested Jack to be part of it. Later, Gavin escapes from house arrest and shows up at the 30 Rock studios. There, he tells Liz that {{he was on his way}} to the Canada–US border but came back to bring her with him. After Liz refuses to go with him, and not wanting to go to prison, Gavin climbs to the top of the TGS with Tracy Jordan set and threatens to jump. Jack tries to talk Gavin out of jumping, distracting him in the process, resulting in Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tackling Gavin down.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} Roberts' idea {{to bring back}} the Cybermen, because there were no other {{returning}} monsters in the series and he thought [...] "there should be a sense of history about the Doctor's final battle to save Earth before he heads off to meet his death". He felt that this was consistent with the theme of [...] "death and lingering darkness" [...] that had run throughout the sixth series. Roberts wanted the audience to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> Craig would really be converted. Moffat felt the [...] "blowing the Cybermen up with love" [...] conclusion was the Doctor Who version of a father bonding with his son. Roberts felt that the episode's depiction of the Cybermen put it on the [...] "silly/terrifying axis" [...] that was common in Doctor Who.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
5000|$|September 2010, they {{released}} their video clip of their song [...] "Tetthakkareen" [...] تتذكرين, this video {{was produced by}} UTN1 and they {{worked so hard to}} prove themselves by releasing this video, the video represents the new style and the real image of UTN1, people <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> this is the real image and they should stick to it, the video is making a great success and great feedbacks are coming from both Arabic media and audience.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Jjaks awakens {{having no}} memory of {{anything}} that happened after his fight with Sam. Seeing Freddie's body in the room along with the gun, he briefly <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he killed Freddie. After being tipped off by Sam, the police arrive but Jjaks hastily avoids being caught. He drives Freddie's body to a remote area in the woods to lay her to rest. All the while, Sam has been watching these events from afar, hoping to see his brother arrested.|$|R
50|$|Twelve-year-old New Yorker Evan Goldman is soon to {{have his}} Bar Mitzvah, and he wants his party to be amazing, but that might not happen because his parents are {{splitting}} up as his father starts {{to fall in love}} with a stewardess, which causes his mother to file a divorce against her husband ("Thirteen/Becoming A Man"). Just as Evan <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> things will be fine, his mother calls to tell him that they are moving to Appleton, Indiana. Once there, however, Evan finds a friend in his neighbor, Patrice, who develops a small crush on Evan while telling him how Appleton, Indiana is ("The Lamest Place in the World").|$|R
500|$|The {{experience}} with King, despite only {{resulting in the}} completion of one track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized {{that they needed to}} work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, [...] "It was kind of seductive to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> someone else [...] solve all of our problems, but in the end you gotta do it yourself".|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2006, Yankovic {{began working}} on the album's parodies. During these sessions, three parodies were recorded; the first of these, [...] "Canadian Idiot", is a play on [...] "American Idiot" [...] by Green Day. It is a satirical {{commentary}} on American nationalism and the stereotypical American view of Canadians. The song is ironic, and Yankovic has stated that the song's anger is a joke and that he loves Canada. Next, Yankovic {{began working on}} [...] "Trapped in the Drive-Thru", a parody of R. Kelly's [...] "Trapped in the Closet". Yankovic was inspired to pen the spoof after hearing the [...] "brilliant and wonderful and ridiculous" [...] original. Efforts to make the parody more convoluted than the original were first considered but then abandoned by Yankovic; he eventually reasoned, however, {{that he could make}} his version [...] "a little more stupid". Thus, the song is an excruciatingly detailed narrative about a couple getting hamburgers at the drive-thru, which was [...] "the most banal thing [...] could think of at the time." [...] Because the song was three times the length of a normal song, legally, Yankovic would have been required to pay thrice the statutory rate for royalties. This in turn would have forced Yankovic to remove one of his parodies from the album. However, R. Kelly allowed Yankovic to only pay the royalty rate for one song. To round out the first session, Yankovic recorded [...] "Confessions Part III", a play on [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] by Usher. The song purports to be a continuation of the Usher songs [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II", focusing on trivial, silly, strange, and disturbing confessions; Yankovic explained that, [...] "After hearing Usher do , I couldn’t help but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he’d left a few things out, that there were a few confessions he had yet to make." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Rachel and {{eliminate}} Sarah, saying [...] "I {{have to think}} as a producer and I do think Rachel was rock solid, and there were moments that I did <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> you were a bit fragile", adding [...] "but you were wonderful and you did exactly what I asked." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{suffering}} with Caleb's betrayal, Hanna now has {{to decide}} if she'll be able to forgive him, or just let him go. Meanwhile, Hanna has to struggle with the marriage between her father, Tom, and her soon-to-be step-mother, Isabel. Her friendships Aria, Emily and Spencer grow — angering Mona, who <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> she has lost her friendship with Hanna. Hanna ultimately forgives Caleb, and they reunite. In order {{to find out who}} is [...] "A," [...] the girls ask Caleb for help, and Hanna worries about it. The season ends with Hanna finding out that Mona is the person behind the anonymous [...] "A." ...|$|R
25|$|If {{you climb}} a {{mountain}} {{for the first}} time and die on the descent, is it really a complete first ascent of the mountain? I am rather inclined to <b>think</b> personally <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> it is quite important, the getting down, and the complete climb of a mountain is reaching the summit and getting safely to the bottom again.|$|R
2500|$|The tenth {{season was}} {{promoted}} as [...] "Season X", and Michael Weatherly dubbed it the [...] "Year of Tiva", saying, [...] "This is the year. Trust me. This is the year." [...] Cote de Pablo was more apprehensive and said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is <b>maybe</b> Michael and his wishful thinking. I've had {{years in which}} I thought, 'Oh my God, this a Tiva year,' {{and there have been}} years he thought were Tiva years…. The truth is, we have yet to find out where that storyline is going to go. I think they're toying around with us like they always do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Others also <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> the two {{humans are}} symbols of {{misplaced}} asceticism - {{perhaps as much}} [...] "conceptual and imaginative" [...] as [...] "actual denial of the flesh." [...] It {{is quite possible that}} Blake is criticizing the New Testament view of a life of self-denial: the stinting of earthly desires in order to gain entrance to an after-life of bliss. The Sunflower, the Youth and the Virgin may be all mis-spending their lives, instead of living them {{in the here and now}} (what Blake called the [...] "eternal Now").|$|E
2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, I thought he was a chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly make you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> he should stay at this game".|$|E
2500|$|After graduating high school, {{believing that}} she could not make a living as a musician, Johnson {{attended}} Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia studying biology and a year later she was in Edmonton, Alberta studying education. [...] During her college years, she frequently sat-in with local bands at night and encouragement from them caused her to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> she could have a career in the music industry. At the age of 20, she taught herself to play the guitar and realizing that her true calling was in music, she went to Vancouver, British Columbia and there she attended Columbia Academy and learned the technical aspects of the music industry. [...] Johnson focussed on songwriting in her spare time and ordered a video featuring songwriters from Nashville to learn more about songwriting and through this video, she joined the Nashville Songwriters Association International.|$|E

Two men {{arrive in}} a boat and are invited for dinner {{but it turns out}} that they are slave traders who want to capture both Crusoe and Friday. So the latter {{collaborate}} in killing the intruders when their violent motives are revealed, and the ship sails away, leaving the protagonists stranded as before. For a while, a kind of friendship develops between Crusoe and Friday. Friday <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> he <b>maybe</b> can teach Crusoe his more relaxed way of living, and not to be controlled by [...] "thoughts of power, guilt and fear", which are very strong traits in Crusoe's personality.|$|R

"It is us, the {{professional}} artists of flamenco, {{who have to}} make cante flamenco, and nobody else, Flamenco, like any other art, is an art of professionals, {{although there are many}} people who peer at us, with a look as if to say: What interesting little creatures! or maybe: Oh! What music the people are playing! and so on. And people often <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> you have to have fingers swollen from picking potatoes to be able to play the guitar with feeling. Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell you that a man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell you that a man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|E

He tries to kiss her, but she tells {{him that he would}} be better off keeping away from her. However, he continues supporting her and they eventually begin dating. Gina and John go through a rough patch in their marriage and Xavier unsuccessfully tries to convince John to resolve the problems. The next time he returns from the police academy, Xavier and Sasha cook for John and Gina to help mend the rift between them. When Xavier helps Sasha win her court case, they go to the beach and declare their love for one another. However, they later break up and Xavier tells Sasha that she needs to deal with what happened with Stu. Xavier becomes suspicious of Jett James (Will McDonald) when Colleen Smart's (Lyn Collingwood) caravan is broken into and her money is stolen. He tells Senior Sergeant Mike Emerson (Cameron Stewart) and tries to get a confession out of Jett. Xavier also suspects Jett of mugging Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) and tries to question him. Both Xavier and John disapprove of Gina's plan to look after Jett when his mother dies. When Xavier learns Jett attacked his mother, he becomes angry and tells Gina to let him go. Gina refuses and when Jett apologises, Xavier <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> Jett can be helped.|$|R

She likes children. Jameel doesn't want {{children of their own}} but Meena wants. They don't have any children because of Jameel. Meena is living with Jameel for years in hope that he will agree one day. One day, Meena asks him to come home early so they can dinner together. He comes early and says that he is married to another woman and she is pregnant. He asks her to leave his home. She says no. He says I will give you divorce. She immediately hits him with a Goat's [...] "Raan" [...] in his head which she was cooking. He hits her many times with it. She goes to her neighbour, Farida and asks her to go with her as she is making Raan and wants her to give her recipe. Farida is shocked to see Jameel's dead body. She tells Meena and she calls ambulance. He is declared dead. Police doubts Meena but Farida and other police officers say that Meena is not that type of woman. She asks police officers to eat Raan as she made it for Jameel and she will feel bad as when Jameel was alive, he always take care of his guests, but when she sees this Raan, she will remember Jameel. Police officers eats it not knowing that it's the murder weapon. Police officers <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> the killer took murder weapon with him.

2500|$|In a 1985 interview, {{when asked}} what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, [...] "Two things, really. One was the {{completely}} negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, {{even if they were}} flying {{up and down the street}} in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> well, <b>maybe</b> there was something to all this." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kelliher {{also stated}} that the album's theme might be [...] "death". He stated the following: [...] "It always makes for really good story telling. It's kind of the theme {{that we have a}} lot in our music. We've had a lot of friends pass away since the last record. I'm not really sure yet. I think we're kind of {{focusing}} more about living on this earth and what would happen if this was your last year to live. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> sort of <b>maybe</b> {{a little bit of what}} we might be kind of touching on." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{more recent}} 2005 interview, he cited the band's various side {{projects}} as a reason, stating that [...] "I truly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it will <b>maybe</b> never happen as we all have full diaries, families, full time jobs and mortgages... I for instance give lessons and I play in 2 other bands... But we will seriously consider it this time, as {{it will be very}} difficult to get all the guys of the band together to go on tour. Besides it was never our intention in the first place to do live gigs as SG is most and for all a real studio band. Maybe, some day, never say never…." ...|$|R

I nearly did; but something stopped me--something held my hand from it, an' lately I've liked to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> what stopped me was something in me that had always been there--something decent that was really a part of me. I hate to think that I was such a beast at heart as I acted like all my life up to that minute. I began to change then. It was mighty slow, an' I'm still a roughneck; but I'm gettin' on. She helped me most, of course, an' now you're helpin' me a lot, too--you an' your poetry stuff. If some dick don't get me I may {{get to be a}} human bein' before I die." ...|$|E

She quit teaching middle school English to afford herself the ability to enroll in an MFA program and pursue a career in poetry. Kathleen said of the experience, [...] "Most poets live humble lives, I <b>think,</b> and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> is by temperament or design, or maybe it is just a necessity." ...|$|R

2500|$|At {{least two}} {{variants}} {{of a conspiracy}} theory about the massacre have been promoted. Interviewed in 2006, Tony Rundle, Premier of Tasmania from 1996 to 1998, admitted that, {{because there was no}} trial, the evidence made public was possibly insufficient to support that Bryant had been the gunman: [...] "At the time, the view was that a trial could do no good for the victims and their families. Now I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> wasn't the case. If all the evidence was heard, then maybe it would have provided some closure and stopped the proliferation of conspiracy theories that sprang up over the years." ...|$|R
