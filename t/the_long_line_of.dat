Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and Bramham was en route after Deucalion had been sunk. The {{main part of the}} convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° MAS, 2° MS and 20° MAS, which made fifteen attacks; <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing an easy target.

25|$|Although the {{production}} of aircraft models continued after the war, the heyday of Dinky ships was between 1934 and 1939. The models were cast from the same unstable alloy that was used across the entire immediate pre-war Dinky range and have therefore also suffered from metal fatigue that makes survivors all the more rare. Small metal rollers were {{also included in the}} design and concealed in the underside of the hull so that the models could be moved smoothly across surfaces. Mirroring the aircraft range, both civilian and military ships were issued, and again, some were disguised. It was not until 1976 that five further models were added to <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> maritime releases from Dinky Toys, these were in the larger scale of 1/180–1/200.

25|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of the}} Chera dynasty is broadly divided into two phases. The Early Cheras {{are said to have}} spanned the period between the 4th century BCE to 5th century CE. The Later Cheras, also known as the Kulasekharas, were in power between the 8th and 12th century. Little is known about the Cheras between these two prominent phases which is often called a 'historical darkness'. The age and antiquity of the Early Cheras is difficult to establish. Most of their history is reconstructed from a body of literature known as the Sangam literature written in Old Tamil around the 3rd century CE. Traveller's accounts suggest that the Cheras existed during the 4th century BCE. Sangam literature records the names of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Chera kings, princes, and the court poets who extolled them. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled and a connected account {{of the history of the}} period is an area of active research. Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems. Senguttuvan, the most celebrated of the Chera kings, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the epic Silapathikaram.|$|E

500|$|In {{evoking the}} English countryside, the poem {{belongs to the}} picturesque {{tradition}} found in John Dyer's Grongar Hill (1726), and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> topographical imitations it inspired. However, it diverges from this tradition in focusing {{on the death of}} a poet. Much of the poem deals with questions that were linked to Gray's own life; during the poem's composition, he was confronted with the death of others and questioned his own mortality. Although universal in its statements on life and death, the poem was grounded in Gray's feelings about his own life, and served as an epitaph for himself. As such, it falls within an old poetic tradition of poets contemplating their legacy. The poem, as an elegy, also serves to lament the death of others, including West, though at a remove. This {{is not to say that}} Gray's poem was like others of the graveyard school of poetry; instead, Gray tried to avoid a description that would evoke the horror common to other poems in the elegiac tradition. This is compounded further by the narrator trying to avoid an emotional response to death, by relying on rhetorical questions and discussing what his surroundings lack. Nevertheless, the sense of kinship with Robert Blair's [...] "The Grave" [...] was so generally recognised that Gray's Elegy was added to several editions of Blair's poem between 1761-1808, after which other works began to be included as well.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Todd McCarthy of Variety {{thought that}} the film should have {{remained}} an episode of Tales from the Crypt. Critic James Berardinelli believed that although The Frighteners wasn't [...] "a bad film", it was [...] "a disappointment, following Jackson's powerful, true-life matricide tale, Heavenly Creatures", {{and because of that}} [...] "The Frighteners fell short of expectations by being just one of many in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> 1996 summer movies." [...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert, felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs, computer animation, and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline. Ebert and critic Gene Siskel gave it a [...] "two thumbs down" [...] rating on their TV show At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, described the film's special effects as [...] "ugly, aggressive" [...] and [...] "proliferating", saying that [...] "trying to keep interested in [...] was like trying to remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in [...] ear". Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that [...] "instead of moving the horror genre in new directions, The Frighteners simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the overmixed onslaught of Danny Elfman's music score". The Austin Chronicles Joey O'Brien, said that although the screenplay was [...] "practically loaded with wild ideas, knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations", it [...] "switched gears" [...] too fast and too frequently that [...] "the audience is left struggling to catch up as [...] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out-of-this-world finale".|$|E

500|$|The troubled times {{enveloping}} Copán at {{this time}} are evident from the funerary tomb of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, which bears sculptures of the king performing war dances with spear and shield in hand. The sculpted column from the temple shrine has a hieroglyphic text reading [...] "toppling of the Foundation House" [...] that may refer to {{the fall of the}} Copán dynasty. Shortage and disease afflicted the massively overpopulated valley of Copán when its last known king, UkitTook', came to the throne on 6February 822. He commissioned AltarL in the style of AltarQ but the monument was never finished — one face shows the enthronement of the king and a second face was started but two others were completely blank. <b>The</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite. With the end of political authority at the city the population collapsed to a fraction of what it had been at its height. This collapse of the city-state, which people believe occurred sometime between 800 and 830 AD, was sudden. However, the population continued to persist and even flourish between the years 750 and 900 AD, and then gradually declined soon thereafter. [...] In the Postclassic period the valley was occupied by villagers who stole the stone from the monumental architecture of the city in order to build their simple house platforms.|$|E
500|$|After {{the game}} was renamed, Doug Church {{recruited}} Dan Schmidt, a college friend who had just graduated from MIT, as a programmer. The team abandoned the Space Rogue engine and created a new one that could display a believable 3D world—one with varying heights and texture-mapped floors and ceilings. Church estimated that {{the first year of}} production was dedicated to creating the game's technological base. However, Neurath stated that the team spent [...] "comparatively little" [...] time on the game's technology, and that [...] "most was spent working on game features, mechanics, and world building". Their ultimate goal was to create the [...] "finest dungeon game, a game that was tangibly better than any of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> dungeon games that came before it." [...] Each member of the small team assumed multiple roles; for example, the game's first two levels were designed by Paul Neurath, while the rest were built by artists, designers and programmers. According to Schmidt, Neurath contracted a writer to create the game's story and dialogue, but the relationship was a [...] "mismatch"; and so the team decided to write the plot themselves. Alongside his programming work, Church co-wrote the game's story with Dan Schmidt, and he gradually took on project leader responsibilities. Writing duties for each level were given to the person who created that level; Schmidt's role was to edit the dialogue of each level to fit with that of the others. Schmidt also created the game's sound effects, which were synthesized—no recorded sounds were used—in a graphical sound editor. Neurath, who Church said was [...] "very day to day {{at the beginning of the}} project", became more involved with the company's business and finances.|$|E
