Guest, his mother and {{stepfather}} Martin moved to north London, and he began the process of experiencing adolescence in a society different from <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> the Rajneesh movement. Guest reentered society at age 11, and faced confusion over the contrast in experiences between his childhood in the Rajneesh movement and his new experiences as a teenager in London. He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London, but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol. He had difficult relations with his stepfather, and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London. Anne and Martin went through a period of time where they thought they were beings from a different world, and read books on UFOs. Guest fostered his interest in reading, and went on to study at university.|$|E

It was recorded <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> the house were plain, old-fashioned furniture and homemade rag rugs laid on painted wood floors. Frances Stover wrote: “Mr. Layton enjoyed visiting the fine homes of his friends; he praised their taste, he admired architectural niceties. But for himself, the small square house was sufficient.” Frederick and Elizabeth had no children. Elizabeth died on 3 June 1910.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 May, the Soviets stormed the Reich Chancellery. In the {{official}} Soviet version, the battle {{was similar to that}} of the battle for the Reichstag. There was an assault over Wilhelmplatz and into the building with a howitzer to blast open the front doors and several battles within the building. Major Anna Nikulina, a political officer with Lieutenant-General I. P. Rossly's 9th Rifle Corps of the 5th Shock Army carried and unfurled the red flag on the roof. However, Beevor suggests that the official Soviet description is probably an exaggeration, as most of the German combat troops had left in the breakouts the night before, resistance must have been far less than <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> the Reichstag.|$|E
25|$|A type long-familiar on French {{railways}} was the 4-cylinder de Glehn compound. The prototype, Nord 701, was a 2-2-2-0 {{designed by}} Alfred de Glehn, an {{engineer at the}} Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM), and ordered by Gaston du Bousquet, chief engineer of the Nord Railway. It had a 4-cylinder layout with the driving wheels uncoupled, and bore a superficial resemblance to a Webb compound, except <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> HP cylinders drove the leading driving axle whilst the LP cylinders were outside, driving the trailing axle. In 1891 two production locomotives, Nord 2.121 and 2.122, were placed in service with the cylinder positions inverted at du Bousquet's insistence, that is outside HP and inside LP, one of which initially had uncoupled driving axles as before but this arrangement proved inferior to the coupled version.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Stevens, who {{reviewed}} [...] "La Couchette" [...] alongside [...] in the Daily Mail, {{speculated that}} there may have been a degree of political satire in episode. He noted <b>that</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 storylines [...] "were never meant to be topical satires, but we're so steeped in electioneering that everything is starting to look like political comment now". He compared the character of Hugo, a [...] "public school chancer ... with a breezy nonchalance and an answer for everything", to David Cameron, and the character of Maxwell, [...] "the uptight little man with the funny voice ... who had committed murder to win his comfy berth and was now beginning to wonder if he’d made a mistake", to Ed Miliband. Stevens claimed <b>that</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 [...] "is bizarre enough for any interpretation".|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by the intimacy of sleeper carriages, in which people aim to sleep in close proximity to strangers. [...] "La Couchette" [...] draws upon the literary tropes associated with stories, such as Murder on the Orient Express and Strangers on a Train, following characters unknown to one another while travelling. The various characters—played by actors somewhat typecast—correspond to British comedy archetypes, and much of the episode's story and humour derives from the characters' unlikability. Critics responded positively to [...] "La Couchette", commending the cast and script, but noted <b>that</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 is something of an acquired taste. On its first showing, the episode was watched by 1.1 million viewers (6.1% of the audience).|$|E
500|$|The {{exterior}} freighter {{scenes were}} filmed on an actual freighter, while interior scenes were filmed both on sets {{and in the}} freighter. The production crew had intended for the engine room scene where Michael goes to detonate the bomb and sees Libby to be shot in the freighter's engine room; instead, they built a new engine room set based on <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> the freighter. It was [...] "so stifling hot" [...] at around [...] and the crew found that [...] "to get air conditioning down here … was an impossible task", according to the Kahanas real life chief engineer Bob Bower. Sculptor Jim Van Houten created twin twenty four foot (seven meter) marine engines for the set, primarily from urethane foam.|$|E

You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise <b>that</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|Another {{key event}} {{in the history of}} PKA {{occurred}} when Susan Taylor and Janusz Sowadski at the University of California San Diego solved the three dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. It was also realized <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> cells, PKA catalytic subunits are found in complex with regulatory subunits and inhibitor proteins that block the activity of the enzyme. [...] An additional facet of PKA action that was pioneered by John Scott at the University of Washington and Kjetil Tasken at the University of Oslo is that the enzyme is tethered within the cell through its association with a family of A-kinase Anchoring proteins (AKAPs). [...] This led to the hypothesis that the subcellular localization of anchored PKA controls what proteins are regulated by the kinase.|$|E

500|$|At {{some time}} in the 19th century, the Arabs began {{referring}} to the wall as the al-Buraq Wall. This was based on the tradition <b>that</b> <b>inside</b> the wall was the place where Muhammad tethered his miraculous winged steed, al-Buraq. The tradition on which this is based only states that the Prophet, or the angel Jibra'il (Gabriel), tethered the steed at the gate of the mosque, meaning: at the gate of the Temple Mount. The location of the entry gate identified as the one used by Muhammad varied throughout the centuries, from the eastern and southern walls, to the southwest corner, and finally at the western wall, and specifically at Barclay's Gate immediately adjacent to the [...] "Wailing Place" [...] of the Jews. Israeli archaeologist Meir Ben-Dov concluded that the Muslim association with Western Wall began {{in the late nineteenth century}} in response to renewed Jewish identification with the site.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of his review of [...] "La Couchette", Stevens {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 is something of an acquired taste. He noted, though, that [...] "even if they don’t make you laugh, you have to concede this duo are the most febrilely inventive writers on TV." [...] Wollaston, who reviewed the episode for The Guardian, observed that humour generally is extremely personal, and said that he [...] "never really got Shearsmith and Pemberton's stuff". He said he could appreciate the narrative and artistry of [...] "La Couchette", and could understand why others found it funny, but that he does not love Inside No. 9, and that, when watching, he is [...] "just not laughing". A viewer unimpressed with the episode wrote to The Times. Disagreeing with Billen's review, the reader claimed that the episode's [...] "puerile humour [...] flatulent as its one-dimensional figures".|$|E
500|$|... "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] was {{extremely}} well received by television critics.

Comedy critic Bruce Dessau {{said he could not}} [...] "speak highly enough of this episode", while McDowall (The Herald and The National) said it was the [...] "best thing [...] seen all year", and [...] "surely the best thing the ingenious Shearsmith and Pemberton have done". Bennion (The Independent) finished his review of the episode by saying <b>that</b> <b>Inside</b> No. 9 was [...] "one of the best pieces of British television in years", and, in a review in i, the episode was described as [...] "unmissably good". After the conclusion of the second series, Victoria Segal and Julia Raeside, writing in The Sunday Times, described [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] as [...] "emotionally affecting and brilliantly crafted", highlighting it as the strongest episode in the series.|$|E
