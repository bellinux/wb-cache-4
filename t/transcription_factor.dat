5|$|About 1500 {{genes are}} linked to {{outcomes}} in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example C-Met and MUC-1, and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> PELP1.|$|E
5|$|Being a <b>transcription</b> <b>factor,</b> {{a protein}} that binds to {{specific}} DNA sites and thereby regulates {{the activity of}} specific genes, Tbr1 is localized in the nucleus where the cell’s DNA is located. Tbr1 is expressed in glutamergic neurons rather than GABAergic neurons.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{periodically}} expressed {{genes are}} driven by <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> (about 20% of all non-essential <b>transcription</b> <b>factors)</b> that show cell cycle progression defects. Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that drive phase-specific gene expression. The expression profiles of these <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> {{are driven by}} the <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{established}} the pivotal role of liver-enriched <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> in organ development and cellular function, {{and there is}} conclusive evidence for <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> to act in concert in liver-specific gene expression. During organ development and in progenitor cells the timely expression of certain <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> is necessary for cellular differentiation, and there is overwhelming evidence for hierarchical and cooperative principles in a networked environment of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors.</b> The search for molecular switches that control stem cell imprinting and liver-specific functions has lead {{to the discovery of}} many interactions between such different molecules as <b>transcription</b> <b>factors,</b> coactivators, corepressors, enzymes, DNA, and RNA. Many of these interactions either repress or activate liver-specific gene expression. It thus can be demonstrated that specific mutational changes in liver-enriched <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> lead to altered intermolecular interactions with the consequence of human disease. This review provides an overview of our current knowledge about liver-enriched <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> and their role in liver function and development.

5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound <b>transcription</b> <b>factor)</b> become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E

5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a <b>transcription</b> <b>factor,</b> Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
40|$|Most oncogenes encode {{activators}} of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> or <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> themselves. <b>Transcription</b> <b>factors</b> {{that are}} induced by growth stimuli are, {{in contrast to}} <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that regulate house keeping genes, tightly regulated and only active, when a stimulus (e. g. cytokines or other growth factors) is given. Examples of such <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> {{are members of the}} jun, fos, myc, NFkB and STAT gene families. In cancer cells this regulation is interrupted, resulting in constitutive activities of <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> that are normally silent. This in turn results in the increased expression of target genes that are necessary for growth and protection from apoptosis. Since inducible <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> are activated by specific pathways, the identification of unusual constitutively active <b>transcription</b> <b>factors</b> also identifies the involved signal transduction pathway. Inhibitors of the components of these pathways may be effective anti-cancer agents, as they interrupt the abnormal signalling and in cancer cells.

5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating <b>transcription</b> <b>factor),</b> NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E

The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved <b>transcription</b> <b>factor</b> with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species.
