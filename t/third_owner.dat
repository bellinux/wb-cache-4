5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's <b>third</b> <b>owner</b> {{and father}} of Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows to hold in contempt, though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E

500|$|The White Sox {{have won}} American League regular season Division Championships in 1983, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2008 under Reinsdorf and {{they won the}} 2005 World Series. [...] In addition, they were in first place of the central {{division}} {{at the conclusion of}} the strike-shortened 1994 Major League Baseball season. [...] The World Series victory made him only the <b>third</b> <b>owner</b> in the history of North American sports to win a championship in two different sports. The baseball championship boosted the value of the franchise to over $300 million. [...] When Reinsdorf signed Jordan after Jordan's announcement that he wanted to play baseball, many thought Jordan's drawing power provided an ulterior motive. [...] Reinsdorf, however, had tried to convince Jordan not to give up basketball, but he did not attempt to make Jordan the highest paid player in the game like some feel he should have.|$|E
60|$|The primary settler, therefore--who, however, {{will not}} usually {{have been the}} primary owner--goes to work upon his land amid all the wildness of nature. He levels and burns the first trees, and raises his first crop of corn amid stumps still {{standing}} four or five feet above the soil; {{but he does not}} do so till some mode of conveyance has been found for him. So much I have said hoping to explain the mode in which the frontier speculator paves the way for the frontier agriculturist. But the permanent farmer very generally comes on the land as the <b>third</b> <b>owner.</b> The first settler is a rough fellow, and seems to be so wedded to his rough life that he leaves his land after his first wild work is done, and goes again farther off to some untouched allotment. He finds that he can sell his improvements at a profitable rate and takes the price. He is a preparer of farms rather than a farmer. He has no love for the soil which his hand has first turned. He regards it merely as an investment; and when things about him are beginning to wear an aspect of comfort, when his property has become valuable, he sells it, packs up his wife and little ones, and goes again into the woods. The Western American has no love for his own soil or his own house. The matter with him is simply one of dollars. To keep a farm which he could sell at an advantage from any feeling of affection--from what we should call an association of ideas--would be to him as ridiculous as the keeping of a family pig would be in an English farmer's establishment. The pig {{is a part of the}} farmer's stock in trade, and must go the way of all pigs. And so is it with house and land in the life of the frontier man in the Western States.|$|E

Lazio's sporting director Igli Tare criticized the <b>third</b> part <b>owner</b> Doyen Sports for numerous times delaying the transfer, “It will remain in history as the most paradoxical and shocking negotiations I have ever been a part of,” said Tare. “These <b>third</b> party <b>owners</b> changed their minds continually.

50|$|When the <b>third</b> <b>owners</b> moved in, {{they too}} remodeled the home, however {{not to the}} extent of the 1920s remodel. The <b>third</b> <b>owners</b> {{completely}} redesigned the kitchen from the ground up. Interestingly, they found several layers of flooring in the kitchen that had been put {{on top of each other}} including linoleum and wood. They redid the flooring in the great room. They redid the plaster in the butler's pantry only to later find out that pipes above the redo were leaking, so everything would have to be taken out, the pipes replaced, and then put back in. A large amount of plaster repair took place as well as some modernization. New pipes were put in on the first floor. A new gas furnace was installed to replace the coal fired furnace that was being used into the 1990s. Upstairs, new showers were put in to replace two old ones. The servants' quarters were turned into a variety of rooms including two guest bedrooms, an office and a laundry room. A new mudroom was added to the back entrance, and the former servants' dining room was turned into the breakfast room.|$|R
