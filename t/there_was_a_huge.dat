5|$|In 1846, 57 {{percent of}} Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish {{as their primary}} {{language}} while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. Under {{one percent of the}} population spoke German. Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, often as a second language, and French was the language of the legal system and government. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions.|$|E

That day, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War {{broke out}} the orchestra's plans {{had to be}} almost {{completely}} changed. During the First World War the public's appetite for concert-going diminished drastically, but {{from the start of}} the Second it was clear that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> demand for live music. The LSO arranged a series of concerts conducted by Wood, with whom the orchestra was completely reconciled. When the BBC evacuated its orchestra from London and abandoned the Proms, the LSO took over for Wood. The Carnegie Trust, with the support of the British government, contracted the LSO to tour Britain, taking live music to towns where symphony concerts were hitherto unknown.|$|E

5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|Various factors {{lay behind}} this sudden mass response. Economically, the news {{had reached the}} US {{at the height of}} a series of {{financial}} recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The gold standard of the time tied paper money to the production of gold and shortages {{towards the end of the}} 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded. This had contributed to the Panic of 1893 and Panic of 1896, which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge,</b> unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil and, for individuals, the region promised higher wages or financial security.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

Others explained how his death allowed Costilla Sánchez to take full directive of the cartel, and that would tighten relations with Colombia and straighten the Gulf Cartel's path, something quite difficult with Ezekiel as co-leader.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Cyrenaica {{was characterized by}} {{the contrast between the}} coastal towns of the Pentapolis, inhabited by Greeks, and the territories inhabited by Libyans.

In some of these cities <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> minority of the population made of Hebrews, who were organized with their own rules.

The Barn became the victim of its own success. After a riot led by students from Bart’s Hospital in 1869, locals complained about the Barn’s increasingly riotous and bawdy clientele. This led to a court case and in 1871 authorities revoked the Barn’s dancing licence.|$|E

It was finally deposed by the Carnation Revolution (Revolução dos Cravos), launched in Lisbon with a military coup on 25 April 1974. The movement was joined by a popular campaign of civil resistance, leading to {{the fall of the}} Estado Novo, the restoration of democracy, and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies and East Timor.

25|$|Philip's troops {{conquered the}} {{important}} trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, then {{the most important}} port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city. Many settled in Amsterdam. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly Sephardi Jews from Portugal and Spain and, later, the Huguenots from France. The Pilgrim Fathers also spent time there {{before going to the}} New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed {{into one of the most}} important commercial centres in the world.
