He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things}} that made Knights of the Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
