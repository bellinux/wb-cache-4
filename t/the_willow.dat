5|$|Two other {{original}} {{sections of}} I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names. The westernmost {{of these is}} <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway, named for <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run complex. The plants at Willow Run produced B-24 Liberator bombers for Ford Motor Company during World War II. The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at Willow Run {{during the war and}} were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit–Chicago highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} originally {{designated as}} <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway were rebuilt from Rawsonville Road in Belleville to Ozga Road in Romulus starting in 1972. As {{part of this}} reconstruction, the segment between Haggerty Road and Ozga Road was widened from four to six lanes, and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I-275, a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time. <b>The</b> <b>Willow</b> Run segment was also resurfaced at this point, as the old road bed did not contain steel mesh. Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive.|$|E

5|$|A {{realignment}} in 1937–38 {{moved the}} M-17 designation in Allen Park. Changes made moved {{the highway to}} turn east on Southfield Road to US25 and follow US25 back to the former routing into Detroit. Another larger change came before 1945 with the completion of <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway. M-17 was rerouted west of the Wayne–Washtenaw county line along the expressway that replaced Ecorse Road. M-17 was joined by Bypass US 112 (BYPUS112) along <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway to a southern freeway bypass of Ypsilanti. M-17 continued past the end of BYPUS112 at US112/Michigan Avenue along a two-lane highway to US23. It then followed US23 back to Washtenaw Avenue in Pittsfield Township to rejoin the original alignment of M-17 west to Ann Arbor. The former M-17 through downtown Ypsilanti was redesignated Business M-17 (Bus. M-17).|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the first}} expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers from Detroit to the defense plants at Willow Run Airport. The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951, which {{proposed}} {{the construction of a}} toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. Interagency politics stalled progress on any proposed turnpikes while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.|$|E

5|$|Described by German {{zoologist}} Friedrich Boie in 1826, {{the genus}} Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly {{part of the}} Old World warbler family Sylvidae, but has now been split off as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff's closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include <b>the</b> <b>willow,</b> Bonelli's, wood and plain leaf warblers.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway {{to carry}} workers from Detroit {{to the defense}} plants at Willow Run Airport. This {{expressway}} was numbered {{as a part of}} US112 initially. During the 1950s, additional highways were converted to freeways before the coming of the Interstate Highway System in 1957. The first highway renumbered as an Interstate was US24A in the southeastern corner of the state, which became part of Interstate 75 (I-75) in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored <b>the</b> <b>willow</b> and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, several {{changes were}} made to US12's routing. A {{southern}} bypass of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti was converted to a freeway. US12 was rerouted to follow the bypass, supplanting the M-17 and Bypass US112 designations used previously on the bypass. US112 was also rerouted, and it ran concurrently with US12 along the bypass. The former route of US12 along Plymouth Road from Ann Arbor east to Detroit was renumbered M-14, and the M-112 designation on <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run and Detroit Industrial expressways was replaced by US12. At {{the same time as}} these {{changes were made}}, the Jackson bypass was upgraded to a full freeway. By the middle of 1958, the Kalamazoo bypass was converted to a full freeway.|$|E
50|$|The Wind in <b>the</b> <b>Willows</b> is a TV {{series that}} was {{originally}} broadcast between 1984 and 1987, based on characters from Kenneth Grahame's classic story The Wind in <b>the</b> <b>Willows</b> and following <b>the</b> 1983 film The Wind in <b>the</b> <b>Willows.</b> It {{was made by}} animation company Cosgrove Hall for Thames Television and shown on the ITV network. An hour-long feature, A Tale Of Two Toads, was broadcast in 1989, and a fifth season of 13 episodes was shown in 1990 under the title Oh! Mr Toad in some countries, whilst retaining the title The Wind in <b>the</b> <b>Willows</b> in others.|$|R

5|$|Kartik {{played in}} ten {{first-class}} matches for Middlesex, taking 33 wickets at 22.87. He took his season's innings best of 5/65 and then 2/26 {{in the season}} opener against cross-London rivals Surrey, and then took 3/32 and 4/53 in a hard-fought 47-run win over Kent, {{and a total of}} 6/139 in the next match against Essex, but his season fell away at the end, managing only six wickets in the last three matches. With the bat, he made 336 runs at 24.00, the most prolific season of his career with <b>the</b> <b>willow,</b> including 62 against Essex and 57 not out against Gloucestershire. He played in a solitary one-dayer, taking 2/19 against Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, <b>the</b> <b>willow</b> warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the wood warbler (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike <b>the</b> <b>willow</b> warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segments}} of upgraded highways along the future route of I-94 were added during World War II. Construction on <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run Expressway started in 1941 before the US entered the war. It was opened on September 12, 1942, to provide improved access to Ford's Willow Run bomber plants. The highway {{was given the}} M-112 designation at the time. The expressway was extended eastward as the Detroit Industrial Expressway into Detroit; the first section opened in 1943 and the remainder was completed in March 1945. Land acquisition for the Edsel Ford Freeway started in 1945. Originally {{referred to as the}} Crosstown Freeway, the freeway became known as the Edsel Ford Freeway following an April 1946 petition. The interchange between the Lodge Freeway and the Edsel Ford Freeway was built in 1953 as the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States. In mid-1956, the M-112 designation was decommissioned and replaced by a rerouted US12. During the mid-1950s, the Detroit Streets and Rails campaign proposed a high-speed rail line in the median of <b>the</b> <b>Willow</b> Run, Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways; instead of building the rail line, special boarding stations adjacent to dedicated bus lanes in the interchanges along the highway were used.|$|E
