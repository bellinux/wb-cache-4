5|$|Homarus gammarus is {{susceptible}} to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> only been seen in captive H.gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H.americanus could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|In April 1973 {{it found}} that Dutch elm <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> been {{imported}} on Rock Elm logs from North America. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> first appeared in 1965. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> originally been shipped to the North America from Britain in <b>the</b> 1930s. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> in Britain <b>had</b> then become less known. There were outbreaks of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> in 1965 in north Gloucestershire and in 1967 in south Essex. Two scientists at the station discovered two strains of <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>The</b> areas affected were southern Hampshire, north-west Kent, the Severn valley, and Ipswich. The scientists realised that these outbreaks {{could have been prevented}} by controlling imports of logs. It had been assumed that as Britain <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> in <b>the</b> 1930s that trees would not be affected. By 1984 Dutch elm <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> reached Scotland. Other diseases of trees to be controlled were Oak wilt and Chestnut blight.|$|R
5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity), both cryosurgery and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} blindness as an outcome. Where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E

5|$|The bark beetle, {{elm leaf beetle}} and the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack elm trees. Bark beetles (Scolytidae) carry Dutch elm disease as they move from {{infected}} breeding sites to healthy trees. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> devastated elm trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn {{a correlation between}} hypothesized causes {{and the history of}} patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission does not mean <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
40|$|Ephemeral fever is a {{viral disease}} of cattle and water buffalo. The more {{spectacular}} epidemics of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> occurred in subtropical and temperate regions of Africa, Asia and Australia. However, {{the virus has}} its home essentially in the tropics. The clinical effects and epidemiology of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> been better studied in the fringe regions than in its heartland. Without a much deeper study of the ecology of ephemeral fever in the tropics the benefits of control measures cannot be demonstrated for the endemic regions...|$|R

5|$|The {{hospitalization}} {{rate for}} hyperparathyroidism in the United States in 1999 was 8.0 out of 100,000. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> a definite tendency to affect younger individuals, typically appearing {{before the age}} of 40, with a study in 1922 reporting that 70% of cases display symptoms {{before the age of}} 20, and 85% before 35. Primary hyperparathyoidism, as well as OFC, is more common in Asiatic countries. Before treatment for hyperparathyroidism improved in the 1950s, half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism saw it progress into OFC.|$|E
5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
50|$|ARN is {{associated}} {{with people who have}} latent herpes viruses that have been reactivated. The most common causes of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> been linked to VSV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV respectively.|$|R
50|$|It was not by {{the time}} that <b>the</b> Kuru <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> spread into an {{epidemic}} when Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, a virologist, and Vincent Zigas, a medical doctor, first started doing research on <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> in 1957. It was first noted in the Fore, Yate and Usurufa people in 1952-1953 by anthropologists Ronald Berndt and Catherine Berndt. After <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> festered into a bigger epidemic the tribal people called to Charles Pfarr, a Lutheran Medical Officer to come to the area to report <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> to Australian authorities.|$|R
50|$|In June 1770, Peshwas set out {{to conquer}} Hyder Ali for the third time. However, Madhavrao was {{infected}} with tuberculosis which started deteriorating his health. Tuberculosis was also termed as “Raj-Yakshma” or <b>the</b> prince of <b>diseases.</b> Madhavrao <b>had</b> to return from Miraj as the effects of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> started becoming prominent. He was even recommended an English doctor for treatment of <b>the</b> terrible <b>disease</b> and he would follow the advice given by the doctor. However, {{there were no signs}} of improvement and slowly it started developing further. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> affected his intestine. There was no cure for tuberculosis in those times. Madhavrao decided to spend his last days in his favourite Ganesha Chintamani Temple, Theur.|$|R
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>has</b> raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Poverty can {{increase}} the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.|$|E
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} erythroblastosis retails {{has been}} observed in man and in certain strains of horses (1, 2) and donkeys (3), while some features of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> also been produced experimentally in dogs (4) and pigs (5). There are, however, {{a number of important}} differences between <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> as it occurs in man and that found naturally or induced experimentally in animals. In the first place, only the hemolytic aspects of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> been reported in animals; hydrops fetalis, intrauterine death, kemicterns, and other serious manifestations of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> thus far been observed only in man. Furthermore, in erythroblastosis fetalis in human beings the antibodies responsible for <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> cross <b>the</b> placenta from mother to fetus and affect the fetus in utero; whereas in the horse, donkey, dog, and pig the offending antibodies are not acquired from the mother during intrauterine life but during the first few hours after birth from the colostmm or milk (1 - 5). In addition, in <b>the</b> experimentally induced <b>disease</b> of dogs and pigs immunization does not take place incidentally to pregnancy, as it does in human beings, but occur...|$|R
50|$|The Middle East, in 2016, {{seems to}} be {{experiencing}} an increase in <b>the</b> cutaneous leishmaniasis <b>disease</b> due to migrants fleeing the Islamic State. Reports {{of the increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>have</b> surfaced in Turkey, Lebanon, and elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|A. euteiches {{was first}} {{described}} by Drechsler in 1925 as the causal pathogen of root rot in peas. [...] At <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>had</b> plagued Wisconsin and the American Midwest, where monoculture was commonplace in pea production for processing, for decades. [...] The pathogen {{has since been}} recorded in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and throughout the United States, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> may <b>have</b> already been widespread {{at the time of}} its discovery.|$|R
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years. Where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> progressed to the stages requiring surgery, the outcomes are generally {{good for the}} treatment of stage 3 ROP, but are much worse for the later stages. Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces the likelihood of a favourable outcome.|$|E
5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} for DPB susceptibility {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, {{that is more}} likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>has</b> continued.|$|E

50|$|MJD can be {{diagnosed}} by recognizing {{the symptoms of}} <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> and by taking a family history.
