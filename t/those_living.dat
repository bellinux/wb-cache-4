5|$|The annual {{incidence}} is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the United States and France. From 1994 to 2003, the incidence increased threefold; {{this has been}} attributed to the more widespread use of modern imaging modalities rather than a true increase. Similarly, <b>those</b> <b>living</b> in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates of diagnosis in those dwelling in cities.
