He later appeared in the television commercial for Gwalior Suiting on the insistence of a family friend, and was subsequently cast by director Anand Mahindroo. The project eventually got cancelled but [...] Khan relocated to Mumbai {{to pursue a career}} in film; he recalls, [...] "Finally I had some direction and focus. I remember [...] feeling so excited <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to Mumbai, stay in my own place and enjoy the adventure of starting my own career." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975 Barlow gave a lauded recital at New York City's Town Hall, {{performing}} a difficult program which included [...] "O Hoffnung! [...] O komm" [...] from Beethoven's Leonore (what {{would later become}} [...] "Komm, Hoffnung" [...] from the revised Fidelio), the final scene from Anna Bolena, and a fully staged interpretation of the opening monologue from Elektra. Andrew Porter of The New Yorker wrote that Barlow [...] "has a secure, powerful, and well-schooled soprano. She {{is the kind of}} honest, solidly reliable singer, definite in intention and definite about the actual notes, that is becoming increasingly rare." [...] After comparing her versatility to that of soprano Florence Easton, Porter noted that [...] "there is not much sensuous allure in Barlow's firm, strong tone, and no trace of dainty charm in her heroic manner. Yet I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to hear her even in so apparently inappropriate a role as Verdi's Violetta or Puccini's Mimi with the assurance that nothing would be fudged or shirked. She drew long, clear lines. She plainly knew the meaning of everything she sang, and how to express it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} was no chance for me if he wanted her. But why didn't they speak out, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> away? Oh, Mr. Masters!" ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE. God knows I {{have often}} felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> on {{if it had}} not been for the sense <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was only an {{instrument}} in the hands of a Power above us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I wish I hadn't fought {{quite so}} hard, Pertusal, for <b>I</b> had hoped <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{altogether}} escaped recognition. <b>I</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> through the campaign without anyone suspecting who I was." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Margaret {{who came}} to where I was {{stationed}} by the jiggermast and told me what had occurred; and {{it was she who}} took my rifle and relieved me so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> aft.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the sea-side. But {{this happens}} {{to be one of the}} summers when nothing but {{mountains}} can save my mother's life. Shall you get down to Rome before you go back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And as I am made," [...] said Sir Richmond {{with sudden}} insistence, [...] "AS I AM MADE--I {{do not believe}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on without these affairs. I know {{that you will be}} {{disposed}} to dispute that." ...|$|E
60|$|However, I {{went to bed}} {{and slept}} on it. Next morning I {{determined}} to set out for Southampton {{on a tour of}} inquiry to all the steamboat agencies. If <b>that</b> failed, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to Plymouth.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, sir; {{it is not}} any planned {{manner of}} mine at all,' she said earnestly. 'But you will see, <b>I</b> am sure, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> down to the hall with you without putting myself in a wrong light.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She tied {{me to the}} bed-post with a long string, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> out of the room, {{and there}} I stayed all day with the little {{worn-out}} shoes hanging up before me {{to remind me of}} my fault." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} I was so {{thoroughly}} fagged out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> no further, so I threw myself upon the floor, bidding Tars Tarkas to do likewise, and cautioning {{two of the}} released prisoners to keep careful watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trial is}} to be in Dublin. Before that day comes we shall find what they do about Lax. I don't suppose they will want me; or if they did, for the matter of <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> myself as well as ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And am I then a baron--a lord?' {{said the}} boy. 'Great lords have books. Were there not some big {{ones on the}} hall window seats? Did not Brother Eldred begin to teach me my letters? I would <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on to learn more!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Father's face became thoughtful. [...] "I believe I will. Lottridge and Shane are {{planning}} <b>that</b> boat trip. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> with them." ...|$|R

'And perhaps I may {{go on to}} say <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> {{on board}} <b>that</b> ship as your {{accepted}} lover, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do a deal more to make you comfortable, particularly when you land, than just as a mere friend, Miss Melmotte. You can't doubt my heart.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will never}} refuse it again. You shall have it now, tomorrow, next day, any {{day that you}} will ask it. Oh, Agatha! my brain is so turned by what you have said, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>go</b> on my knees to beg him to accept it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Francisco," [...] muttered Leonard, for his emotion {{would not}} suffer {{him to speak}} aloud, [...] "you are a saint and a hero. I wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> through this in your stead, for most gladly would I do so, {{but it is not}} possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|I wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> Through the red doors where I {{could put}} off [...] My shame like {{shoes in the}} porch, [...] My pain like garments, And leave my flesh {{discarded}} lying Like luggage of some departed traveller [...] Gone one knows not where.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, now," [...] she added, [...] "don't let's be cross {{just the}} little {{time you have}} to stay with me. I do wish our house were not all torn up, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> home with you, and leave Newport and all its bothers behind." ...|$|E
60|$|She dried {{her eyes}} directly, with a shiver {{as if it}} was cold, and took my arm. I led her back to the house-gate; and then, feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> in to lunch as usual, after what had happened, said I would return to the fishing-place.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} left the priesthood," [...] he told her simply. [...] "I had found out--knew {{certainly}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> on, even before I saw you.

6000|$|... "Of course, you {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> on the Mary Bartlett {{to join you}} and accompany you to Acapulco, for that would have involved too great a loss of time.

6000|$|... "I did a set {{of papers}} last week," [...] the boy replied. [...] "On the given {{percentages}} I came out twelfth or better. Mr. Brown assured me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> in for them at any moment. He promised to write you about it before he left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What needs {{dwelling}} on it?' he muttered; 'doubtless they are engaged by this time! I shall surely do something desperate {{if they come}} here, under my very eye. Would <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the Antipodes, ere I forfeit Louis's love! But my grandmother, Clara! Was ever man so miserably circumstanced?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> with you, {{my white}} brother, and share your dangers {{down to the}} coast," [...] he said; [...] "but I could aid you but little, and {{my life would be}} {{forfeited}} on my return.

5000|$|Following {{his trip}} to Los Angeles in 1959 and being refused entry into Disneyland, on {{security}} grounds, a dejected Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev joked, [...] "...just now <b>I</b> was told <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> to Disneyland, I asked [...] "Why not?" [...] What is it, do you have rocket launching pads there? ...|$|R
60|$|After {{consulting}} my watch, I satisfied myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the mill, and {{get back}} again, before the hour fixed for our late dinner--supper we should have called it in Germany.

6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} chance, Denis, {{though my}} route {{is not as}} clearly marked out as yours is. I wish to heaven <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> by the same ship.

60|$|She had {{the mercy}} to spare me the actual words, yet her tone told me as plainly {{as if she}} had uttered them <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> with her or not, as I should choose.

60|$|Theodore's attic, {{where he}} slept, {{was at the}} top of the house, whilst my room was on the ground floor, and so <b>I</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now <b>go</b> back quite comfortably to my office in the hope that more remunerative work and more lavish clients would come my way before nightfall.|$|R
60|$|Kolk gave me {{explicit}} directions, {{though with}} my map I {{do not believe}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> wrong.

40|$|Let {{me begin}} by saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> came to theory because I was hurting-the pain within me {{was so intense}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> on living.

I saw in theory then a location for healing...|$|R
