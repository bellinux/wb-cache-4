40|$|Significant {{evolutions}} of aircraft, airspace and airport {{systems design}} and operations {{are driven by}} the continuous increase of air transport demand worldwide and by the concurrent push for a more economically viable and environmentally sustainable aviation. In the operational context, novel avionics and air traffic management (ATM) systems are being developed {{to take full advantage}} of the available communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) performance. In order to attain higher operational, economic and environmental efficiencies, the generation of 4 -dimensional trajectories (4 DT) shall integrate optimisation algorithms addressing multiple objectives and constraints in real-time. Although extensive research has been performed in the past on the optimisation of aircraft flight trajectories and very efficient algorithms were widely adopted for the optimisation of vertical flight profiles, it is only in the last few years that higher levels of integration were proposed for automated 4 DT planning and rerouting functionalities. This chapter presents the algorithms conceived for integration in next generation avionics and ATM Decision Support Systems (DSS), to perform the multi-objective optimisation of 4 DT intents. In particular, the algorithms are developed for 4 DT planning, negotiation, and validation (4 -PNV) in online strategic and tactical operational scenarios, and are conceived to assist the human flight crews and ATM operators in planning and reviewing optimal 4 DT intents in high air traffic density contexts. The presented implementation of the multi-objective 4 DT optimisation problem includes a number of environmental objectives and operational constraints, also accounting for economic and operational performances as well as weather forecast information from external sources.

40|$|The {{air traffic}} control domain is facing higher levels of automation. This will shift air traffic {{controller}} tasks to more monitoring and may cause negative impacts such as out-of-the-loop phenomena (OOTL) of controllers. MINIMA (Mitigating Negative Impacts of Monitoring high levels of Automation) will help to understand and mitigate OOTL phenomena of {{air traffic control}}lers in highly automated environments, particularly <b>Terminal</b> <b>Manoeuvring</b> <b>Areas</b> (TMA). With the use of e. g. electroencephalography, eye-tracking and other measures a level of vigilance and attention is computed. Adaptive automation, function allocation, additional tasks, or attention guidance in case attention is not where it is necessary will influence the controllers’ behaviour to ensure safe and secure ATC operations also during rare automation failures. MINIMA's objective is to improve comprehension of OOTL performance problems, particularly in future air traffic scenarios. In MINIMA, tools were developed to detect and compensate {{the negative impact of}} this phenomenon and a carefully selected distribution of tasks between the human agent and the automated system for the selected use case of a highly automated TMA. Specific Tools and a reasonable task distribution are required to profit from the advantages of higher levels of automation while coping with potential disadvantages. MINIMA developed a dynamic task allocation to keep the human in-the-loop, i. e. sufficiently aware of the traffic situation. Within the developed concept not all tasks, that could be automated, will be automated every time. A real-time monitoring system for operators’ vigilance was developed in MINIMA. This serves as base for the dynamic task distribution. Finally a new set of procedures was developed to cope with the new concept and, most importantly, with possible automation failures or the misinterpretation of the situation by the system. These fall-back procedures are required as higher levels of automation will go along with procedures that cannot be followed by operators without the support of automation even when they are kept in the loop...|$|R

40|$|A key {{challenge}} in Air Traffic Management (ATM) {{is to provide}} a schedule with high throughput on the runways, {{and at the same time}} meet objectives connected to taxiing times and punctuality while ensuring safe operations within the apron, taxiway, runway, and <b>terminal</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area.</b> High throughput is achieved through optimised runway sequences. These sequences must frequently be revised, for example due to uncertainty in the available data. Hence, as updated information become available, the flight scheduling process continues throughout the day. Furthermore, since many of the activities and operations at the airport are prioritized and planned due to the previous schedule, it is important that the scheduling process does not create too much deviation from one plan to another. In this thesis we present an approach for rescheduling, where we have modelled stability requirements in the objective function. We present new distance functions for measuring stability, and stability is formulated with respect to time and the runway sequence. We present computational results and analyse the trade-off between stability and optimality.

40|$|International {{audience}} 4 D trajectory {{prediction is}} the core element of future air transportation system, which is intended to improve the operational ability and the predictability of air traffic. In this paper, we introduce a novel model to address the short-term trajectory prediction problem in <b>Terminal</b> <b>Manoeuvring</b> <b>Area</b> (TMA) by application of machine learning methods. It consists of two parts: clustering-based preprocessing part and Multi-cells Neural Network (MCNN) -based machine learning part.

Then, the trajectories are clustered into partitions and noises by Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method. After that, the Neural Network (NN) model is chosen as machine learning method to find out the good predicting model for each individual cluster cell. Finally, with the real traffic data in Beijing TMA, the predicted Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each flight is generated. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method is effective and robust in the short-term 4 D trajectory prediction. In addition, it can make an accurate trajectory prediction in terms of MAE and RMSE with regards to comparative models...|$|E
40|$|Current {{operations}} in the <b>terminal</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>area</b> (TMA) are a bottleneck for the local air traffic system and hence may limit its efficiency. Under today’s circumstances, the operation of a TMA is optimised for high traffic throughput. However, in many cases this optimization is detrimental to the environment with regard to noise and fuel emissions. Continuous descent operations (CDO) have shown {{to be able to}} abate a significant part of these emissions, however prove to be incompatible with a high traffic flow rate through the TMA. It is hence today required to trade the two requirements off against each other. The DLR has developed a traffic management concept for the TMA which allows aircraft equipped with advanced fourdimensional flight management systems (A-FMS) to save route length and fuel while approaching larger airports. Aircraft not equipped with these A-FMS will be guided in path stretching areas like today and do not really benefit from this newly designed TMA.

The MOTO algorithms {{take into account}} updated weather and neighbouring traffic data, {{as well as the}} related forecasts from selected sources. Multiple user-defined operational, economic and environmental objectives can be integrated as necessary. Two different MOTO algorithms are developed for future implementation in ATM systems: an enroute variant and a <b>Terminal</b> <b>Manoeuvring</b> <b>Area</b> (TMA) variant. In particular, the automated optimal 4 DT replanning algorithm for en-route airspace operations is restricted to constant flight level to avoid violating the current vertical airspace structure. As such, the complexity of the generated trajectories reduces to 2 dimensions plus time (2 D+T), which are optimally represented in the present 2 D ATM display formats. Departing traffic operations will also significantly benefit from MOTO- 4 D by enabling steep/continuous climb operations with optimal throttle, reducing perceived noise and gaseous emissions...|$|E
