40|$|The {{alternation}} of contraction and detraction {{processes in}} public administration is linked with long-term tendencies {{in the political}} system. From {{the last quarter of}} the 19 th century <b>the</b> influence of <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> (<b>the</b> Norwegian <b>Parliament)</b> increased, but later the executive power has been strengthened. This is a tendency discernible in all modern industrialized states. The contraction and detraction phenomena can be related to the amount of controversial political issues in the society. It would seem justified to assume that when the amount of conflicts is great, a political contraction will take place. Then, it is important what values the bureaucracy realizes. Conversely in a period of strong values community there will be a political detraction, since the need for an autonomous bureaucracy can be met at a smaller risk. Also, an autonomous bureaucracy functions best in a state of values community and will, moreover, tend to simulate a community of values and ignore conflict. It is in the interest of the autonomous bureaucracy to soften political and social conflicts. Such conflicts can, precisely, be signs of an outbreak of new values systems threatening the autonomous civil servants’ roles. Therefore, an autonomous bureaucracy will be a conservative element. This point of view implies consequences for the idea of the ever-increasing bureaucratization of society, in the sense that bureaucracy will steadily fortify its dominating position in society. The condition for such a bureaucratization is that the production of new values in society comes to a halt. If this is the case, the power chances of bureaucracy will increase: In the long run, professional civil servants can realize established values far more efficiently than can amateurs and voluntary forces. The result will be a biased distribution of information and influence in favour of bureaucracy. As soon as there is a crack in the values community, the civil servants roles will be redefined towards a greater dependence of political authorities (Jacobsen 1964 : 259 - 260) ...|$|R
40|$|That the Church of Norway has now adopted gender {{equality}} as its policy, {{is a new}} situation in a historical perspective, and {{is the result of}} a long process within the framework of the state church system. In this context, the way in which <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> (<b>the</b> Norwegian <b>parliament)</b> dealt with <b>the</b> issue of admitting women to clerical offices in the 1930 s was important. The purpose of this thesis has been to examine the argumentation of <b>the</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>Storting,</b> and <b>the</b> way in which this argumentation was related to developments within the Church and within society. The arguments for and against allowing women to be ministers in the debate in 1934 and in 1938 are expounded and systematized with the help of methodology inspired by the "pro et contra" method of Arne Næss, whilst material from the intermediate debate in 1936 is mainly included in parts of the rest of the analysis, where the arguments are accounted for within their context. The understanding of the debate in this thesis is that it was basically a battle for {{gender equality}}. The study classifies the debate in the following way: the view of women, the view of the Church, the view of the role of the parliamentarians and contemporary understanding. The contextual examination of the debate is organized in corresponding sections. The presentation is based on a more general historical background, involving a thematic analysis of <b>the</b> debate in <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> in 1912 on admitting women to public offices. The thesis shows that the debate took place at a time when sharply opposing views of women were in evidence. It examines the relationship between the fight for equality and the gradual shift in the Church's view about women's service, and how the issue of formal and actucal power within the Church was made vivacious. The Labour Party was unanimously in favour of women ministers, the Christian Democratic Party of Norway was opposed, whilst the compromise proposal, which provided a provisional solution to the matter in 1938, came from the Liberal Party. The conclusion of the thesis is that the underlying reasons for the main divisions in the points of view about women ministers are to be found in the diverging views about the relationship between the sexes, understanding of Christianity, insight as a parliamentarian and the historical development. From a methodological point of view, as reflected upon in the thesis, the main pattern is that the question of how <b>the</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> argued is answered by using an analysis that has its basis in a positivistic orientation, whilst the question of how the argumentation was related to developments within the Church and within society is answered by using a more hermeneutical approach...|$|R
40|$|This master's {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} discourses of {{knowledge}} and learning based on policy documents that helped split an education in Norwegian upper secondary schools. The education program Media and Communication (MK) was changed from a newer hybrid structure to the established academic and vocational preparatory structure for a voting in <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> (<b>the</b> Norwegian <b>Parliament)</b> in June 2013. The first class that started with the hybrid structure of MK was born in 2001, and the model will be phased out after the last class in the spring of 2018 (a total of 15 classes). All had many applicants, and the explanations for the application pattern are different. But there is consensus that this education is (and has been) practical and characterized by an employment- oriented methodology. The fact that the program had many applicants has been explained by several factors. The practical methodology {{is an integral part of}} these circumstances that emerge from the thesis' empirical data. But values behind the practical methodology is not decisive in the political process, it has no consequences for political action. We have followed the political discourse that has taken place in the three-month-long consultation period, from <b>the</b> Report to <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> 20 (2012 - 2013) On the right track. Quality and diversity in public schools, which was published in 2013, until the decision was taken. <b>The</b> Report to <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> 20 (2012 - 2013) emphasizes and requires in many cases a practical pedagogy that is to be implemented in Norwegian primary and secondary education, but this is not a topic when the MK-case is considered. Since this thesis is a qualitative study, we seek explanations for why this discrepancy can occur in practical politics. Inspired by a method called Political Discourse Analysis (PDA), we have identified three discourses that have characterized the process, and we have given them the names knowledge discourse, flexibility discourse and qualification discourse. Different readings of the selected empirical data and analysis for categorization have been the tools behind the findings. The thesis illustrates how an instrumental discourse structures (flexibility discourse) is closely linked with a knowledge discourse, where it collides antagonistically in a qualifying discourse. It is in this qualifying discourse there is dispute about what is valid knowledge and learning. The thesis argues that fundamental values of practical work in learning are at stake in this qualifying discourse: if the practical work has value in itself or is reduced to an instrument for implementation and certification...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Norwegian system for defence planning. More {{specifically}} it is {{an analysis of the}} Chief of defence’s (CHOD) quadrennial defence study process {{and its impact on the}} following Parliamentary White Paper (or long term plan) for the defence sector issued by the Government. The defence studies are regarded as the main input from the military side to the more political process which involves the issue of the White Paper and the subsequent discussion in <b>the</b> <b>Storting</b> (<b>Parliament).</b> <b>The</b> survey comprises the six CHOD defence studies that have been issued since the first in 1986 and the subsequent six White Papers. The analysis identifies some characteristics of the defence study process and compares the main content of the defence study with the following White Paper. The objective has been to identify key issues that may have an impact on the planning process, and to investigate to what extent the recommendations from the CHOD defence study process is taken into account and transferred into the Parliamentary White Paper. The document studies have been supplemented by interviews with key personnel. The thesis suggests that the defence studies have had a varying impact on the following White Paper. It is also suggested that the impact has been gradually increasing over time since the first one, and that the impact is depending on the level of integration with other participants in the defence planning process such as the Department of Defence and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment. Moreover the analysis suggests that the defence studies have little influence on the budget proposals, but may be more important for overall direction setting and conceptual change. Another finding is that the defence studies may be contributing to underestimation of cost and conservation of the existing defence structure...|$|R
