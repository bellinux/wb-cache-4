50|$|Centennial Park has a {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} that makes its home in the park or uses it frequently. The range includes pelicans, black swans, mallard ducks, White ducks, purple swamphens, Common moorhens, coots, <b>Toulouse</b> <b>geese,</b> Emden geese, turtles and eels, plus European carp that were introduced into the park's ponds and are now regarded as a pest. There is also a colony of flying foxes in the Lachlan Swamp (including the grey-headed flying fox).|$|R
40|$|Phenetics of 22 breeds of geese, strains and {{varieties}} {{reared in}} Russia and Ukraine and previously described from {{the historical and}} genetic standpoints were studied. A total of 58 non-metrical variations (phenes) from the main exterior complex were used for cluster analysis. Emden and some other European white goose breeds are {{close to each other}} and differ from greylag goose (Anser anser). The breeds derived from both the swan goose (A. cygnoides) and greylag goose formed the second, third and fourth clusters. The fifth cluster included the breeds and strains similar to their direct progenitor - greylag goose. The Vladimir Clay geese originated from the crossing between the Kholmogory White and <b>Toulouse</b> <b>geese</b> demonstrated considerable phenetic and phylogenetic isolation. Domestic geese of the first and fifth clusters (phenons) were united into the European breed group with two subgroups, Emden and Toulouse. The breeds of the second, third and fourth clusters (phenons) were ranked in the Euro-Chinese (Euro-Asiatic) group...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Geese {{are one of}} {{the most}} ancient poultry species, domesticated about 3000 – 2500 B. C. There are {{currently}} several different goose production techniques, some of them known from time immemorial: 1) force-feeding for fat liver (Egypt, 2686 – 2181 B. C.); 2) selection for extremely large body size, exceeding that of modern <b>Toulouse</b> <b>geese</b> (Egypt, 600 B. C. – 200 A. D.); and 3) feather plucking, introduced by ancient Egyptians and Romans. Commercial goose breeding today is dispersed as almost cosmopolitan. The majority of world goose flocks are concentrated in Asia, predominantly in China. In Europe, especially eastern Europe, we observe plentiful goose breed diversity (Fig. 1). The main goose products are raw and processed foodstuffs (meat, fat liver, and goose fat) and down and feathers for stuffing [...] . Conclusion. Further progress in goose production will depend on new tendencies in world market development and diversification, and will rely on advances in selection and management utilizing goose biological and economic features. Integration of genetic, nutritional, reproductive and management approaches — all of which are necessary for more complete utilization of goose genetic potential and adjustment to specific production systems — will aid sustainable production of a variety of healthy and high-quality goose products...|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} {{strain of the}} <b>Toulouse</b> <b>goose</b> was bred to be fast growing, gaining weight rapidly {{when there is an}} abundance of food and no room for exercise. It is thus an important meat producer and, with its oversized liver, a source of foie gras. Geese of the type without dewlaps lay 25-40 eggs extra-large white eggs per year, while geese of the dewlap type lay 20-35. Additionally, the goose's fluffy feathers are a good source of down feather.|$|E

40|$|Abstract It is {{commonly}} accepted that avian influenza viruses (AIVs) bind to terminal α 2, 3 sialic acid (SA) residues whereas human influenza viruses bind to α 2, 6 SA residues. By {{a series of}} amino acid changes on the HA surface protein, AIVs can switch receptor specificity and recognize α 2, 6 SA positive cells, including human respiratory epithelial cells. Animal species, like pigs and Japanese quail, that contain both α 2, 3 and α 2, 6 SA become ideal environments for receptor switching. Here, we describe the SA patterns and distributions in 6 common minor domestic poultry species: Peking duck, <b>Toulouse</b> <b>geese,</b> Chinese ring-neck pheasant, white midget turkey, bobwhite quail, and pearl guinea fowl. Lectins specific to α 2, 3 and α 2, 6 SA (Maakia amurensis agglutinin and Sambuca nigra agglutinin, respectively) were used to detect SA by an alkaline phosphotase-based method and a fluorescent-based method. Differences in SA moieties {{and their ability to}} bind influenza viruses were visualized by fluorescent labeling of 4 different H 3 N 2 influenza viruses known to be specific for one receptor or the other. The geese and ducks showed α 2, 3 SA throughout the respiratory tract and marginal α 2, 6 SA only in the colon. The four other avian species showed both α 2, 3 and α 2, 6 SA in the respiratory tract and the intestines. Furthermore, the turkey respiratory tract showed a positive correlation between age and α 2, 6 SA levels. The fact that these birds have both avian and human flu receptors, combined with their common presence in backyard farms and live bird markets worldwide, mark them as potential mixing bowl species and necessitates improved surveillance and additional research about the role of these birds in influenza host switching. </p...|$|R
