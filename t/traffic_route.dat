5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary <b>traffic</b> <b>route,</b> including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more, and by 1939 the whole road had been sealed. Congestion at the Perth end of the road in the 1930s led to parallel roads Berwick Street and Shepparton Road being upgraded to provide bypasses. The entire Perth−Albany road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, in recognition of its importance as an arterial <b>traffic</b> <b>route.</b> From the late 1970s, $49 million over ten years was spent on repairing Albany Highway, and the experience saw Main Roads develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction. Since the 1990s Main Roads has been upgrading various portions along the length of Albany Highway, including widening sections to dual carriageways in Perth, and the construction of the Kenwick Link bypass.|$|E

Forest Avenue, too, is intersected by both roads; however, Forest and the Staten Island Expressway are on the opposite extremities of the island.|$|E
25|$|Mount Price is {{near the}} highly {{populated}} southwest corner of British Columbia, indicating that it poses {{a serious threat to}} the surrounding area. Even though Plinian eruptions have not been identified at Mount Price, Peléan eruptions can also produce large amounts of volcanic ash that could significantly affect the nearby communities of Whistler and Squamish. Mount Price is also situated in the immediate proximity of a major air <b>traffic</b> <b>route.</b> Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Peléan eruptions may cause short and long term water supply problems for the city of Vancouver and most of the Lower Mainland. The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from Mount Price. An eruption producing floods and lahars could destroy parts of the Sea to Sky Highway, threaten communities such as Brackendale and endanger water supplies from Pitt Lake. Fisheries on the Pitt River would also be at risk. These volcanic hazards become more serious as the Lower Mainland grows in population. More than 60% of British Columbia's people live in the Lower Mainland and it is one of Canada's most rapidly changing ecoregions. This is mostly because of its increasing population and economic development.|$|E

The A3 motorway route is complete since no extensions or alterations to the route are planned by applicable legislation.|$|E
500|$|In November 1939, the State Advisory Committee on Nomenclature {{recommended}} that the Perth–Albany road be named Great Southern Highway, in recognition of its importance as an arterial <b>traffic</b> <b>route.</b> This suggestion followed on from the naming of Great Eastern Highway, in April of the previous year. The committee sent letters to all the local governments {{in the area to}} advise them of the proposal. Feedback was mixed; whilst the name was [...] "thoroughly approved" [...] by the Tambellup Road Board, and the Perth City Council's general purposes committee {{recommended that}} no objection be raised, the Kojonup Road Board believed that [...] "sufficient grounds [...] not exist for the proposed change", and the Albany Municipal Council objected strongly to not retaining [...] "Perth–Albany" [...] in the name.|$|E

500|$|With the {{deterioration}} of the fourth span, the bridge commission and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation started construction on a $9.38 million (2007 USD ($ in [...] )) concrete bridge with steel beams connecting <b>Traffic</b> <b>Route</b> 434 on the Pennsylvania side (assigned in 1967) and Touring Route 55/Sullivan County Route 11 (assigned in 1930). The construction began on February 2004, and since there was no place to perform a groundbreaking ceremony, the construction company hired, Fahs Construction Group of Binghamton, New York performed a [...] "bridge-breaking" [...] ceremony on March 25, 2004, taking sledgehammers to the bridge. The bridge was expected to have resemble the Roebling Aqueduct, which lay to the north in Minisink Ford, New York. The bridge was proposed to be [...] with twin [...] travel lanes and an [...] shoulder. It was to also have three balconies facing upstream of the Delaware River, to offer travelers scenic views.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was {{planning}} to extend PA 145 and US 222. Traffic engineer Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown is one of few Pennsylvania cities without a <b>traffic</b> <b>route</b> going through it. After the plan was introduced, he said that motorists might be aided if US 222 is extended along Hamilton Boulevard {{to connect with the}} proposed PA 145 corridor. PennDOT originally planned the road as US 222 but AASHTO denied the extension, stating that the route [...] "is not the shortest or best available route between major control points on the system, and therefore, does not adhere to the policies established under AASHTO's 'Purpose and Policy Statement for U.S. Numbered Highways'". In addition, the route did not meet the criteria for a business route. In 1991, it was commissioned as PA 222. PA 145 was extended south of the US 22 freeway to the I-78/PA 309 overlap near Lanark.|$|E
500|$|Record {{executives}} {{in the music industry}} believe that music charts will increasingly be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries. Sean Carey, a research fellow in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Roehampton, wrote that the flow of popular music will no longer be a single <b>traffic</b> <b>route</b> from North America and Europe {{to other parts of the}} globe, but will also move the other way as well. According to Adam Sherwin from The Independent, the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the [...] "traditional reluctance" [...] of radio stations to play foreign-language songs. The song is also underlining a shift in how money is being made in the music business. Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have raked in almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in its content. The Harvard Business Review published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts. Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views. As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart. According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen's [...] "Call Me Maybe", pop became the UK's favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion's share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.|$|E
