500|$|In 1969, Skelton {{performed}} a self-written monologue about the Pledge of Allegiance. In the speech, he {{commented on the}} meaning of each phrase of the pledge. He credited one of his Vincennes grammar school teachers, Mr. Laswell, with the original speech. The teacher had grown <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> his students monotonously recite the pledge each morning; he then demonstrated to them how it should be recited, along with comments about the meaning behind each phrase. [...] CBS received 200,000 requests for copies; the company subsequently released the monologue as a single on Columbia Records. A year later, he performed the monologue for President Richard Nixon at the first [...] "Evening at the White House", a series of entertainment events honoring the recently inaugurated president.|$|E

500|$|Campbell's {{production}} improved {{greatly in}} 1983 {{as he had}} 1,301 yards and 12 touchdowns, and was invited to his fifth Pro Bowl. However, the Oilers finished the season tied for the worst record in the league at 2–14. Unhappy after he was pulled {{in the second half}} against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 10, Campbell demanded to be traded. He completed the season with the team but remained adamant with his demand in the off-season. [...] "I'm <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> every week how I'm too dumb, washed up, too dumb to read holes, can't block, can't catch the football," [...] he said. The team's back-to-back dismal seasons also added to his frustration. In 1984, under new head coach Hugh Campbell, Houston started the season with six straight losses. After rushing for 278 yards total in the first six games of 1984, Campbell was traded to the New Orleans Saints, reuniting him with Bum Phillips.|$|E

On the other hand, Sterling Whitaker of The Boot put [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] at number six on his list of Top 10 Jason Aldean Songs. Laura McClellan of Taste of Country ranked the song at number three of Aldean's Top 10 songs, citing it as [...] "the biggest reason the industry is beginning to recognize Aldean with award nominations."

500|$|U2's first {{ideas for}} Zoo TV {{emerged during the}} Lovetown Tour in 1989, when various aspects of radio {{programming}} intrigued the group, particularly the large radio audience their Dublin concerts reached. The wild antics of [...] "morning zoo" [...] radio programmes inspired the band to consider taking a pirate radio station on tour. They were also interested in using video {{as a way of}} making themselves less accessible to their audiences. The band developed these ideas in late 1990 while recording Achtung Baby in Berlin at Hansa Studios. While in Berlin, they watched television coverage of the Gulf War on Sky News, which was the only English programming available. When they became <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> about the conflict, they tuned into local programming to see [...] "bad German soap operas" [...] and automobile advertisements. The band believed that cable television had blurred the lines between news, entertainment, and home shopping over the previous decade, and they wanted to represent this on their next tour.|$|E

Jill Menze of Billboard, while reviewing The Fame Ball Tour, complimented Gaga's vocals on the song by saying, [...] "The fame-obsessed ballad 'Paparazzi' showed how adept she can be with her range." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that, [...] "You may quickly <b>tire</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> the album's theme constantly reiterated, but the tune of 'Paparazzi' takes up residence in your brain and refuses to budge."

She criticizes his overly devout dedication to his training that has seen him distance himself from Ken for a long time, while he <b>tires</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> her desire <b>of</b> revenge against Bison and is aghast at her announcement that she has started working with Interpol. The main storyline did not focus on Chun-Li nor Ryu, but rather the aftermath of Sagat's murder of Ken, which itself was never resolved as the comic was canceled at Capcom's request after only three issues.|$|R
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of America—we are <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Sakic {{was a quiet}} individual, he {{was able}} to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic's {{leadership}} began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen {{as the leader of the}} team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick Eric Lindros, and holding onto Lindros' rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros, saying, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic's leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain Mark Messier, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.|$|E
500|$|In 1989–90, {{his second}} NHL season, Sakic {{was able to}} switch his number back to his {{familiar}} #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At {{the start of the}} next season, 1990–91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991–92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> that name. He's not here {{and there are a lot}} of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.|$|E
