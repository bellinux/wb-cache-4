50|$|This gene encodes a glycosylated {{transmembrane protein}} that is cleaved {{to form a}} mature, {{secreted}} protein. The N-terminus of the precursor protein shares characteristics with other surfactant proteins and is sometimes called chondrosurfactant protein, although no biological activity has yet been defined for it. The C-terminus of the precursor protein contains a 25 kDa mature protein called leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-1 or chondromodulin-1. The mature protein promotes chondrocyte growth and inhibits angiogenesis. This gene is expressed in the avascular zone of prehypertrophic cartilage, and its expression decreases during chondrocyte hypertrophy and vascular invasion. The mature protein likely {{plays a role in}} endochondral bone development by permitting cartilaginous anlagen to be vascularized and replaced by bone. It may also be involved in the broad control of <b>tissue</b> <b>vascularization</b> during development. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic, contrast material-enhanced, fast low-angle shot MR imaging was performed of 100 musculoskeletal lesions in 36 female and 64 male patients (aged 9 - 81 years [mean, 34 years]). The highest slope value of the time-intensity curve was calculated pixel by pixel and displayed on the FP image, with a gray-scale value equal to the slope value. <b>Tissue</b> <b>vascularization</b> and perfusion were evaluated at pathologic and angiographic examinations in 33 lesions. RESULTS: A significant difference (P <. 001) {{was found between the}} FP slope values of benign (mean, 36. 2 % per second) and malignant (mean, 67. 4 % per second) lesions. FP images depicted <b>tissue</b> <b>vascularization</b> and perfusion rather than benignity or malignancy, because there is an overlap in the slope values of highly vascular benign lesions and malignant lesions. CONCLUSION: FP images provide diagnostically useful information by depicting <b>tissue</b> <b>vascularization</b> and perfusion...|$|E

Empirical functions {{can also be used to}} fit experimental data without the need of any assumption about tumour physiology, as in pharmacokinetic models, increasing their diagnostic utility, in particular when automatic diagnosis systems are implemented on the basis of an MRI multi-parametric approach. Phenomenological universalities (PUN) represent a novel tool for experimental research and offer a simple and systematic method to represent a set of data independent of the application field. DCE-MRI acquisitions can thus be advantageously evaluated by the extended PUN class, providing a convenient diagnostic tool to analyse functional studies, adding a new set of features for the classification of malignant and benign lesions in computer aided detection systems.

Although embryonic angiogenesis has been intensively studied, far less is known about tissue revascularization and vessel remodeling in adults due to methodological difficulties. In the current studies, we developed a novel in vivo model of neovascularization that is performed on the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). A provisional matrix placed on the CAM was vascularized in response to FGF- 2. In order to distinguish new from pre-existing vessels, the matrix was separated from the CAM by a nylon grid. Techniques to visualize the three dimensional structure of vascular networks and a method for rapid and semi-automated quantification were developed. This novel model allowed us to {{study the effects of}} potential inhibitors of <b>tissue</b> <b>vascularization</b> and their effects on the pre-existing vasculature. We found that while fumagillin or inhibition of MEK and Src inhibited only neovascularization, addition of cortisol or wortmannin was toxic to pre-existing vessels. The CAM model allowed intravital observations during extended periods of time, which together with immunohistochemical analysis revealed a novel mechanism of <b>tissue</b> <b>vascularization.</b> Tensional forces generated by myofibroblast-mediated contraction of the provisional matrix, induced and directed ingrowth of vascular tissue. During the initial stages of vascularization, the vascular network was recruited from the surrounding tissue through a non-angiogenic mechanism by elongation and enlargement of pre-existing vessels, which were moved as vascular loops with constant functional circulation. Ingrown vessels were remodeled, presumably through intussusception, fusion and pruning.

Since large intravenous sensors are not feasible, measuring inside the interstitial fluid is considered the best alternative. This option, unfortunately, has the drawback of a lag time with blood glucose values. A good strategy to circumvent this is to enhance tissue integration and enrich the peri-implant vasculature. Implants of different optically transparent biomaterials (poly(methyl-methacrylate) [PMMA] and poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS]) - enabling glucose monitoring in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum - were surface-treated and subsequently implanted in goats at various implantation sites for up to 3 months.

In a forward genetic screen, we identified angiogenesis defects in tmem 2 zebrafish mutants that lack both arterial and venous Vegf/Vegfr/Erk signaling. Strikingly, tmem 2 mutants display increased hyaluronic acid (HA) surrounding developing vessels.

The PC 295 tumor used in this study showed promising morphological characteristics, with high tissue viability and high and homogenous GRPr expression (Fig.  1 d and Additional file 1 : Figure S 1), leading to an expected high accumulation of the targeting radiopeptide. In vivo high-resolution SPECT findings revealed, however, that peptide binding was not consistent in all areas of the tumor (Fig.  1, Additional file 2 : Figure S 2).

This behaviour critically depends on chemokine receptor cxcr 4 a function. We show that the relevant Cxcr 4 a ligand Cxcl 12 a selectively accumulates in newly forming bone tissue even when ubiquitously overexpressed, pointing towards a tissue-intrinsic mode of chemokine gradient formation.

Specifically, we show that plasmin processing of PlGF- 2 yields a protease-resistant core fragment comprising the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 1 binding site but lacking the carboxyl-terminal domain encoding the heparin-binding domain and an 8 -amino acid peptide encoded by exon 7. We have identified plasmin cleavage sites, generated a truncated PlGF 118 isoform mimicking plasmin-processed PlGF, and explored its biological function in comparison with that of PlGF- 1 and - 2. The angiogenic responses induced by the diverse PlGF forms were distinct. Whereas PlGF- 2 increased endothelial cell chemotaxis, vascular sprouting, and granulation tissue formation upon skin injury, these activities were abrogated following plasmin digestion.

Subsequently, biodegradation of BG, BM, BME and VN(1) was faster than TD, VN(2), and VN(3). OS showed only a minute amount of superficial biodegradation 24 weeks following implantation. Biodegradation of TD, BM, BME, VN(2), and VN(3) was associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. Within the limits {{of the present study}}, it was concluded that cross-linking of bovine and porcine-derived collagen types I and III was associated with (i) prolonged biodegradation, (ii) decreased <b>tissue</b> integration and <b>vascularization,</b> and (iii) in case of TD, BM, BME, VN(2), and VN(3) foreign body reactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{hepatocyte}} growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) during wound healing {{in the skin}} was investigated, using HGF/SF-overexpressing transgenic mouse model. Histological analysis of HGF/SF transgenic mouse excisional wound sites revealed increased granulation <b>tissue</b> with marked <b>vascularization.</b> Northern blot analysis demonstrated that, relative to control, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in transgenic skin was significantly higher at baseline and was robustly up-regulated during wound healing. Elevated levels of VEGF protein were detected immunohistochemically, predominantly in endothelial cells and fibroblasts within the granulation tissue of HGF/SF transgenic skin. Serum levels of VEGF were also elevated in HGF/SF transgenic mice. Thus, results from our study suggest that HGF/SF has {{a significant effect on}} <b>vascularization</b> and granulation <b>tissue</b> formation during wound healing in vivo, involving with induction of VEGF...|$|R
