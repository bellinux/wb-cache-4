5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>republic,</b> except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic,</b> who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E

5|$|Meiklejohn {{resolved}} {{to open a}} new, experimental liberal arts college in late 1924, but struggled to find funding. Seeking $3 million for the venture, he was rejected by Bernard Baruch and Abraham Flexner but through support from <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic</b> Herbert Croly was offered planning funds from the magazine's main benefactor. The planning team included journalist Mark Sullivan, New School professor Alvin Johnson, and The Century Magazine editor-in-chief Glenn Frank. Frank had previously published Meiklejohn's work and was sympathetic to his cause.|$|E
5|$|The 12 member central {{committee}} of the Free Officers proclaimed themselves the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the government of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>republic.</b> Lieutenant Gaddafi became RCC Chairman, and therefore the de facto head of state, also appointing himself {{to the rank of}} colonel and becoming commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Jalloud became Prime Minister, while a civilian Council of Ministers headed by Sulaiman Maghribi was founded to implement RCC policy. Libya's administrative capital was moved from al-Beida to Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>republic</b> until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E

5|$|The Sundance Channel airings {{attracted}} more viewers in the 18-to-24 age range than was usual for their audience, which typically comprised men over age 25. After the second episode aired, cultural critic Lee Siegel {{wrote about the}} show for <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic.</b> He pontificated on transgender experience, and characterized the story as a unique form of drama or tragedy. In his introduction, he commented on the general absence of reviews for the show in major news publications.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixteenth and}} final {{level of the}} game takes place during Dark Empire, six years after s Battle of Endor. The Rebel Alliance has {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic,</b> which now controls {{three quarters of the}} galaxy. After the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the Galactic Empire collapsed, but was reborn under a mysterious new leader (who is actually a clone of Palpatine). Rogue Squadron, now under the command of Wedge Antilles, continues to fight the Empire to protect the newly formed Republic.|$|E
5|$|While Texas had won its independence, {{political}} battles raged {{between two}} factions of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Republic.</b> The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, {{the expulsion of}} the Native Americans, {{and the expansion of}} the Republic to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War.|$|E

5|$|While minor, Moore {{managed to}} earn much needed media {{interest}} in the later part of the election mostly due to John McCain's red baiting against Barack Obama and making {{an appeal to the}} 5th US Circuit Court to get ballot access in the state of Louisiana. His media campaign included writing articles in several leading newspapers such as <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic</b> and the National Journal and making appearances on television, most notably The Colbert Report.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Republic</b> of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Crittenden {{remained}} {{an outspoken critic}} of Jackson and his successor, Martin Van Buren. He supported Henry Clay's plan for distributing proceeds from the sale of public lands among the states, and also joined Clay in opposing the administration-backed Second Seminole War. One of the few administration proposals he supported was the recognition of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Republic</b> of Texas. During this period of Crittenden's service in the Senate, the issue of slavery rose to prominence. Crittenden was regarded as a moderate on the issue, seeking to keep it out of politics altogether. In 1836, he resisted petitions by the Quakers to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., but he also opposed radical pro-slavery measures such as John C. Calhoun's proposal to ban abolitionist literature from being delivered by mail in the Southern states.|$|E
50|$|The Congress of Panama, {{organized}} by Simón Bolívar in 1826 {{with the goal}} of bringing together <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>republics</b> of Latin America in a permanent alliance, was often referred to as The Amphictyonic Congress, in homage to the above.|$|R
50|$|After Burma's {{independence}} in 1948, the Gurkhas joined the infant Burma Army. Many Gurkhas served in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>republic's</b> various campaigns against ethnic insurgents and the Kuomintang invasions.

5|$|In 1793, {{during the}} War of the First Coalition, Ernouf {{was sent to}} Cassel to {{strengthen}} the French position. The Duke of York laid siege to Dunkirk and blockaded the town of Bergues, on the Belgian border, which had insufficient garrison {{to fend off the}} British. Ernouf assembled a force of a thousand men and joined Jean Nicolas Houchard; together they marched to the relief of Dunkirk. Once there, he led a column in attack on the British camp. On 5 complémentaire an I (21September 1793), which would have been {{the last day of the}} first year of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Republic,</b> he was raised to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed on 9 vendémiaire an II (30September 1793) as chief of staff to the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|In Vision of the Future (1998), the Grand Admiral is {{revealed}} to be an impostor named Flim, employed by Moff Disra to motivate the Imperial troops. Major Grodin Tierce, the clone of a former stormtrooper imbued with Thrawn's tactical intellect by the Grand Admiral himself, strategized that the false Thrawn {{could also be used}} to rally support for the Empire and intimidate <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic.</b> The tactic is successful until Admiral Pellaeon and the smuggler Talon Karrde—on opposing sides but desiring peace—expose Flim. Meanwhile, at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn, Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near-complete clone of Thrawn, which is killed during their escape.|$|E
5|$|Other black {{newspapers}} {{also carried}} significant {{coverage of the}} lynching, as did liberal papers such as <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Republic</b> and The Nation. Freeman traveled around the U.S. to speak to audiences about her investigation, maintaining that a shift in public opinion could accomplish more than legislative actions. Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre. Leaders of the NAACP hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington's death, but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost.|$|E
50|$|After the {{revolution}} {{resulted in the}} formation of the Republic of Texas in 1836, Wharton supported Austin's unsuccessful candidacy for president, losing to Sam Houston.
