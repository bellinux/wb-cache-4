40|$|Collaborative {{working methods}} offer {{the hope of}} reduced waste, lower <b>tendering</b> <b>costs</b> and {{improved}} outputs. The costs of tendering {{may be influenced by}} the introduction of different working methods. Transaction cost economics appears to offer an analytical framework for studying the costs of tendering, but it is more to do with providing explanations at the institutional/industry level, not at the level of individual projects. Surveys and interviews were carried out with small samples in UK. The data show that that while <b>tendering</b> <b>costs</b> are not necessarily higher in collaborative working arrangements, there is no correlation between costs of tendering and the way the work is organized. Practitioners perceive that the benefits of working in collaborative procurement routes far outweigh the costs. Tendering practices can be improved to avoid waste, and the suggested improvements include restricting selective tendering lists to 23 bidders, letting bidders know who they are competing with, reimbursing <b>tendering</b> <b>costs</b> for aborted projects and ensuring that timely and comprehensive information is provided to bidders...|$|E

40|$|This article explores New Zealand's {{experience}} with introducing species into the quota management system (QMS). The Fisheries Amendment Act 1986 {{brought about the}} QMS based on the allocation of individual transferable quota (ITQ) to those who met the eligibility criteria. At that time, 27 commercially valued species were introduced into the QMS. While the intent was to manage more species within the QMS, introduction occurred slower than initially anticipated, with only another 15 species introduced into the QMS by 2000. The last major impediments to the QMS introduction process were removed in 2001 with the full implementation of the Fisheries Act 1996 {{and the development of}} a new registry computer system. The Ministry of Fisheries then embarked on a project to introduce a further 50 species into the QMS by 2004. This article outlines the challenges encountered and legislative and procedural changes made for introducing species into the QMS. This article contributes to the broader discussion on the application of ITQ to the management of fisheries resources and does not necessarily express the views of the Ministry of Fisheries.

40|$|The {{design and}} build {{procurement}} route has witnessed significant growth in the UK construction industry over the last ten years. It is now being used for {{both private and public}} sector projects of varying complexity. There are several advantages associated with this method of construction procurement including shortening of lead times, involvement of the contractor in the design process, greater price certainty, improved communication and reduced construction time amongst others. Conversely, there are also a number of disadvantages ascribed to the {{design and build}} method of procurement. Some of these include reduced design quality, inhibition of changes by clients, and high <b>tendering</b> <b>costs.</b> A new process model is proposed to address many of the procurement route's present shortcomings. In particular, the model facilitates concurrent project development in the design and build process through the integration of all project participants into a multi-functional matrix team capable of resolving potential 'downstream' problems early in the project life-cycle, and the provision of a formal mechanism for the improved abstraction of client requirements based on design function deployment (DFD) - a concurrent engineering design system.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} One {{way in which the}} {{tendering}} process can be further improved is by reviewing and clarifying the high costs that participants face {{during the course of the}} tendering phase. The study aims to provide project teams working in construction tender preparation a clear picture of what to expect when tendering for infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach Firstly, a review of current literature on tendering in infrastructure projects is conducted to identify the associated costs affecting traditional and PPP procurements as well as the potential measures contributing to tendering cost-reduction. A theoretical framework and its corresponding research hypotheses, which are based on the literature reviewed, are then proposed. An industry-wide questionnaire survey is currently under design to solicit industry practitioners’ views on <b>tendering</b> <b>costs</b> and the associated tendering cost-reduction measures. The data collected in the survey will subject to statistical analysis to test the proposed research hypotheses, which will be reported in a forthcoming paper. Findings and value The direct and indirect costs in public-private procurement have been identified and have been categorised into internal and external costs arising from working on tender submissions. A theoretical framework, mainly composed of five mechanisms of cost reduction, has been proposed and will be tested in a forthcoming industry-wide questionnaire survey. Originality/value of paper The findings are expected to lead to a transparent tendering process in infrastructure procurement, in which there is increased engagement from the private sector as well as an increase in competitive tendering...|$|E

40|$|The French {{tendering}} {{system for}} {{urban public transport}} services, introduced by the Sapin law in 1993, has often been criticized for its lack of competition. In order to check the relevance of this criticism, this thesis examines the degree of competition in the French market, using two surveys of the outcomes of tenders in the urban public transport networks outside the Paris region. The first one was conducted by the CER TU (Centre d'Etudes sur les Reseaux, les Transports, l'Urbanisme Et les Constructions Publiques) in 1996. The second survey, undertaken in 1999 {{as part of this}} thesis research, focused on networks serving a population over 200, 000 inhabitants and is based on the official minutes of the organizing authorities on the deliberation of the delegation of urban public transport services, and interviews conducted with organizing authorities, operators, and several organizations involved in urban public transport in France. Based on these two surveys, it is established that there is a small number of participants in most French tenders and that the operators in general lack competitive behavior. From this evidence, the thesis identifies five reasons for the lack of competition in the French tendering system. One obstacle is regulatory: labor law L 122. 12, which imposes the renewal of employment contracts on the new incumbent. The other four obstacles are: asymmetries among bidders, high <b>tendering</b> <b>costs,</b> high operation risks, and the OA' s perceived failure to conduct a fair selection. A literature review of the relevant theories on competition, industry concentration and tendering, is conducted in order to support the analysis of obstacles to competition in French tendering with the necessary theoretical background. It is then shown that all the five factors are barriers to entry, and that they should be removed, or at least reduced, in order to stimulate the entry of new competitors and therefore true competition. The thesis concludes with a presentation of a set of three strategies to improve the competition in the French market, that could be implemented within the current regulatory framework, that is to say, without modifying labor law L 122 - 12. For each strategy, the tradeoffs between increased competition and effectiveness and quality of service are discussed. The first strategy consists of the reduction in the bundle size of service to be tendered out. The second strategy proposes a reduction of contract duration, and the third strategy consists in the improvement of the specification and selection process. It is recommended to combine all three strategies together for maximum impact on competition; this impact may however be modest, as a major barrier to entry, labor law L 122 - 12, has not been removed. The modest {{increase in the number of}} bidders that could be achieved may still lead to an improvement in competition, and therefore in price. by François-Xavier Duporge. Thesis (S. M.)

The object {{of this study was}} to gain an understanding of the factors influencing contractors' cost estimating practice. This was achieved through a comparative study of eighty-four UK contractors classified into four categories, namely, very small, small, medium and large firms. The initial analysis of the 24 factors considered in the study shows that the main factors relevant to cost estimating practice are complexity of the project, scale and scope of construction, market conditions, method of construction, site constraints, client's financial position, buildability and location of the project. Analysis of variance, which tests the null hypothesis that the opinions of the four categories of companies are not significantly different, shows that except for the procurement route and contractual arrangement factor there is no difference of opinion, at the 5 % significance level, on the factors influencing cost estimating. Further analysis, based on a factor analysis technique, shows that the variables could be grouped into seven factors; the most important factor grouping being project complexity followed by technological requirements, project information, project team requirement, contract requirement, project duration and, finally, market requirement.

In this field {{there have been two}} directives adopted {{at the level of the}} European Union that sets preconditions to the national legal systems of Member States. Arthur van Heeswijck has examined the conformity of the Dutch system of legal protection of entrepreneurs in procurement procedures with European law and the consistency of those rules. The Dutch system of legal protection is broadly in line with European law, but the Public Procurement Act 2012 contains a number of gaps. For example, contracting authorities are under the EU Procurement Directives obliged to motivate the decision to withdraw a procurement procedure. This obligation has not been implemented in the Public Procurement Act 2012. In some cases, entrepreneurs are entitled to reimbursement of the <b>tender</b> <b>costs,</b> if the contracting authority has made a mistake. The Dutch legislation lacks this provision. The cohesion of the Dutch system of judicial can be improved too. For example, in European procurement procedures contracting authorities are obliged to keep documents which have been received from tenderers confidential. Without justification, a similar provision lacks for national procurement procedures. A provision for confidentiality should be laid down in the general part of the Public Procurement Act 2012, which is applicable to all documents, regardless of the nature of the procedure...|$|R
