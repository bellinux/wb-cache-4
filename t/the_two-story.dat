Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

Starting in 1979, construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills.

5|$|The Foster–Payne House is a {{historic}} house at 25 Belmont Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Built in 1878, <b>the</b> <b>two-story</b> multi-gabled house is distinguished by its clapboarded and exterior woodwork and opulent parlors in the interior. The property also has a matching carriagehouse with gable roof and cupola. The house was originally constructed and owned by Theodore Waters Foster, but it was sold to George W. Payne in 1882. The Foster–Payne House is architecturally significant as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century suburban residence.

5|$|The {{ground floor}} of <b>the</b> <b>two-story</b> 306ft long {{building}} contained a clothing factory, dry cleaning plant, furniture plant, brush factory, and an office, where prisoners of the federal penitentiary could work for money. They earned a small wage for their labour which was put into an account, known as a Prisoner's Trust Fund, which would be given to them upon leaving Alcatraz. They made items such as gloves, furniture mats, and army uniforms. The laundry room occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time. Each window has 9 panes and there are 17 bays on each floor on either side.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} {{with an eye}} toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff colored brick. Red brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored brick on the majority of the facade. <b>The</b> <b>two-story</b> Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of floor space.|$|E

Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>two-story</b> Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>two-story</b> Roman Revival {{building}} of the observatory was designed by architect Willard Smith after the Roman Tower of the Winds in Athens and was built in 1865. It was named after New York City businessman Daniel S. Schanck, who donated {{a large portion of}} the funds to construct and equip the observatory. Outfitted with telescopes, clocks, and other scientific equipment donated to Rutgers, the Schanck Observatory served as the university's first astronomical observatory and was used to provide instruction to its students through the nineteenth and early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|When Steve Jobs, chief {{executive}} officer of Apple Inc. and Pixar, and John Lasseter, then the executive vice president of Pixar, decided to move their studios from a leased space in Point Richmond, California, to larger quarters of their own, they chose a 20-acre site in Emeryville, California, formerly occupied by Del Monte Foods, Inc. The first of several buildings, a high-tech structure designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, has special foundations and generators to ensure continued film production, even through major earthquakes. The character of the building is intended to abstractly recall Emeryville's industrial past. <b>The</b> <b>two-story</b> steel-and-masonry building is a collaborative space with many pathways.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the mid-19th}} century, all houses and marketplaces in Antananarivo, and {{throughout}} Madagascar, were constructed of woods, grasses, reeds and other plant-based materials viewed as appropriate for structures {{used by the}} living. Only family tombs were built from stone, an inert material viewed as appropriate to use for the dead. British missionaries introduced brick-making to the island in the 1820s, and French industrialist Jean Laborde used stone and brick to build his factories {{over the next few}} decades. It was not until the royal edict on construction materials was lifted in the 1860s that stone was used to encase the royal palace. Many aristocrats, inspired by the royal palace and <b>the</b> <b>two-story,</b> brick houses with wrapped verandas and divided interior spaces built by British missionaries, copied the British model for their own large homes in the haute ville. The model, known as trano gasy ("Malagasy house"), rapidly spread throughout the central highlands of Madagascar, where it remains the predominant house construction style.|$|E
5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house had become a Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though {{the house had been}} heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. <b>The</b> <b>two-story</b> masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E
5|$|The Fuller Houses are {{originally}} {{believed to}} have been constructed as identical -story Queen Anne-styled homes with both having their gable-ends facing the street. The southern flank of the building is visually broken up by a two-story bay window with a gabled peak. A semi-octagonal bay on the northern corner of the houses indicates the position of the front staircase. A single-story porch with a shed-roof overhangs the front doorways. A striking feature of the Fuller Houses is <b>the</b> <b>two-story</b> circular porch on the southwest side. The porches are almost removed from the building and topped with a conical roof and ornamented with Queen Anne-style spindle. The exterior walls of the houses are clapboarded and the tops of the gables have simple metal finials.|$|E
