50|$|The ODOP {{transponder}} is {{a modified}} version of the transponder used by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the Ranger vehicles. Separate antennas are used for the receiver and the transmitter. The transponder consists of a double superheterodyne receiver (890 MHz) and a transmitter (960 MHz).

50|$|GPSDOs {{typically}} phase-align {{the internal}} flywheel oscillator to the GPS signal by using dividers {{to generate a}} 1PPS signal from the reference oscillator, then phase comparing this 1PPS signal to the GPS-generated 1PPS signal and using the phase differences to control the local oscillator frequency in small adjustments via the <b>tracking</b> <b>loop.</b> This differentiates GPSDOs from their cousins NCOs (numerically controlled oscillator). Rather than disciplining an oscillator via frequency adjustments, NCOs typically use a free-running, low-cost crystal oscillator and adjust the output phase by digitally lengthening or shortening the output phase many times per second in large phase steps assuring that on average the number of phase transitions per second is aligned to the GPS receiver reference source. This guarantees frequency accuracy {{at the expense of}} high phase noise and jitter, a degradation that true GPSDOs do not suffer.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the keys}} to the {{usefulness}} of a GPSDO as a timing reference {{is the way it is}} able to combine the stability characteristics of the GPS signal and the oscillator controlled by the <b>tracking</b> <b>loop.</b> GPS receivers have excellent long-term stability (as characterized by their Allan deviation) at averaging times greater than several hours. However, their short-term stability is degraded by limitations of the internal resolution of the one pulse per second (1PPS) reference timing circuits, signal propagation effects such as multipath, atmospheric conditions, and other impairments. On the other hand a quality oven-controlled oscillator has better short-term stability but is susceptible to thermal, aging, and other long-term effects. A GPSDO aims to utilize the best of both sources, combining the short-term stability performance of the oscillator with the long-term stability of the GPS signals to give a reference source with excellent overall stability characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the {{standard}} generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geospatial positioning with global coverage. As of 2007, the United States NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is the only fully operational GNSS. Based on bandwidth optimization criterion, the GPS receiver is proposed for solving the carrier/code phase tracking problem. Tracking {{is the part of}} the baseband signal processing. The carrier phase <b>tracking</b> <b>loop,</b> the frequency <b>tracking</b> <b>loop,</b> and the code <b>tracking</b> <b>loop</b> are the main three tracking loops in receiver. The architecture of the tracking loops are analyzed and designed with respect to thermal noise and dynamic stress errors. The noise bandwidth in the <b>tracking</b> <b>loop</b> is the most important parameter. The optimization method of noise bandwidth is developed in GPS receiver to provide a better tracking performance.

30|$|In addition, the Swarm GPS {{receivers}} {{are affected}} by ionospheric scintillation, which slightly degrades their performance when flying close to the geomagnetic poles and the geomagnetic equator. This affects in particular {{the quality of the}} kinematic orbits, which show larger errors at these locations. To improve the robustness of the Swarm GPS receivers for ionospheric scintillation, the receiver settings have been modified by widening the bandwidths of the <b>tracking</b> <b>loops.</b> With the updated <b>tracking</b> <b>loops,</b> the amount of collected GPS observations increases by about 1.3  % and occasional tracking losses due to severe equatorial ionospheric scintillation are greatly reduced. The wider bandwidths of the carrier loops also significantly reduce the large carrier phase residuals close to the geomagnetic poles, and no degradation is visible for GPS observations at midlatitudes. Both the reduced-dynamic and kinematic orbits show lower SLR residuals, which indicates that the updated <b>tracking</b> <b>loops</b> also improve the POD performance for both orbit types.|$|R
30|$|It is {{expected}} that the modified <b>tracking</b> <b>loops</b> will also improve the determination of kinematic baselines, which suffers from the degraded Swarm GPS receiver performance over the geomagnetic poles. With more robust <b>tracking</b> <b>loops,</b> the larger errors over these areas are greatly reduced, as shown in Figs.  9 and 12. In addition, it is anticipated that the modified <b>tracking</b> <b>loops</b> will also reduce the systematic errors along the geomagnetic equator that {{are present in the}} gravity fields determined from Swarm GPS data. These systematic gravity field errors vary in time and are larger when the satellite crosses the equator during the post-sunset hours. They also show a seasonal dependency, with larger errors during equinoxes and minimum errors during summer. This suggests that the errors are caused by equatorial scintillation. Jäggi et al. (2015) show that these systematic gravity field errors can be reduced by discarding GPS data that are affected by large ionospheric changes. This procedure was also applied for the GOCE satellite, which showed similar disturbances (Jäggi et al. 2015). However, the Swarm receiver was found to be even more sensitive to this effect than the GOCE receiver, and lower threshold values had to be used for the rejection of Swarm GPS data. It {{is expected}} that with more robust <b>tracking</b> <b>loops,</b> the threshold value for the Swarm GPS data can also be relaxed.|$|R
