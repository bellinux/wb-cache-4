5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice as likely to be affected as men.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} in raising <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for <b>the</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> pairs are typically at least seasonally monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E

5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended {{for a role}} on <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> the Restless instead. The role was to be portrayed as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E
5|$|Fenmore Baldwin is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> the Restless. Created by former head writers Lynn Marie Latham and Kay Alden {{as the son}} of Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman), the character was born onscreen during the episode airing on October 13, 2006. Initially portrayed by various child actors including Robbie Tucker, the character was rapidly aged to a teenager in 2012, with Max Ehrich assuming the role.|$|E

Thirty miles to the west, he established a mission at Turtle Mountain to serve as a base for expansion toward the Canadian Rockies.|$|E

5|$|Roger however has a secret: he {{once had}} a {{long-term}} affair with the French aristocrat the Prince of Soissons, with whom he begins anew soon after arriving in Paris. Through the actions of courtiers jealous of Barbara's devotion to Roger, pamphlets eventually spread about the affair. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> naive Barbara is among the last to hear of it and breaks down in tears and shock.|$|E

5|$|A {{month later}} in March 2011, it was {{announced}} that Francis had landed the newly created role of the mother of Daniel Goddard's character, Cane Ashby, on <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> the Restless. The casting would reunite her with several of her former General Hospital alumni, including Tristan Rogers, Stephen Nichols, Judith Chapman and Kin Shriner. In a statement on how she received the newly created role, Francis revealed that Maria Arena Bell, the series' executive producer and head writer, called her (having seen her appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show) and offered her a role personally, to which Francis accepted.|$|E
5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise <b>the</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. Within the next few years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world.|$|E
5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> elderly, {{were subject}} to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and artisans. Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and artisans emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, artisans exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Tracey E. Bregman was {{the first}} winner of this award for her role of Lauren Fenmore on <b>The</b> <b>Young</b> <b>and</b> the Restless. The awards {{ceremony}} had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award was originally called Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series, the criteria of the new category were deemed confusing; performers of differing ages were nominated and critics argued some were of supporting or lead actress standards. Adding to the confusion, the first winner, Bregman, and the Outstanding Supporting Actress winner that year, Beth Maitland, played characters near to the same age. The category was renamed Outstanding Juvenile Female in a Drama Series in 1989 and began using its current title in 1991. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actress be aged 25 or below.|$|E
