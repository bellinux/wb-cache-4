5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
50|$|Any observable, i.e., any {{quantity}} {{which can}} be measured in a physical experiment, should be associated with a self-adjoint linear <b>operator.</b> <b>The</b> <b>operators</b> <b>must</b> yield real eigenvalues, since they are values which may come up {{as the result of the}} experiment. Mathematically this means <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> <b>must</b> be Hermitian. <b>The</b> probability of each eigenvalue is related to the projection of the physical state on the subspace related to that eigenvalue. See below for mathematical details.|$|R
50|$|Non-synchronous {{transmissions}} {{are designed}} to depend upon an operator experienced in changing gears. <b>The</b> <b>operators</b> <b>must</b> understand how to shift the transmission {{into and out of}} gear. Many learn how to do this in certifying schools.|$|R

25|$|Free-motion machine {{embroidery}} can be time-consuming. Since {{a standard}} sewing machine {{has only one}} needle, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> pause to re-thread the machine manually for each subsequent color in a multi-color design. He or she must also manually trim and clean up loose or connecting threads after the design is completed.|$|E
500|$|Disassembly of the Type 94 Nambu pistol is {{considered}} difficult {{and can lead}} to damage to the pistol if done carelessly. [...] After clearing the Type 94, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> draw the slide against the magazine follower to hold the bolt {{to the rear of the}} pistol. This will allow the crossbolt to be released after the firing pin is depressed. Removal of the crossbolt without depressing the firing pin will damage both the firing pin and the crossbolt. Removing the crossbolt is further complicated as the disassemblers hands are both holding the pistol and depressing the firing pin.|$|E
500|$|The {{high-speed}} {{version of}} the hose/drogue refueling system {{is designed to be}} deployed at [...] and function at up to [...] Onboard tanks and a roll-on/roll-off bladder can contain up to [...] of fuel. <b>The</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> open the ramp to extend the refueling hose, then raise the ramp once extended, with the top ramp door left open. The V-22 could refuel rotary-wing aircraft, but it would require a separate drogue used specifically by helicopters and a partially converted nacelle. Since many Marine Corps ground vehicles can run on aviation fuel, a refueling V-22 could also service them. In late 2014, it was stated that such tankers could be operational by 2017, but a contract delay pushed IOC to late 2019.|$|E

40|$|For a {{class of}} {{integral}} operators it is shown that if the integral kernel of one <b>operator</b> majorates <b>the</b> kernel of the other one then certain forms of eigenvalue estimates are inherited. <b>The</b> <b>operators</b> <b>must</b> be related to a positivity preserving semigroup and, respectively, a positively dominated semi-group. It follows, in particular, that any, sufficiently regular, eigenvalue estimate for <b>the</b> Schrodinger <b>operator</b> is carried over automatically to <b>the</b> magnetic Schrodinger <b>operator,</b> regardless of <b>the</b> method of obtaining the estimate...|$|R
500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc welding, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|His son-in-law, Ralph Flanders, {{reported}} that Hartness examined “some {{of the elements}} which go into making workmen both contented and productive” in his book The Human Factor in Works Management.

In fact, the man is the greater part. The personal welfare of <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> be considered. This is something more than the man’s relation to the machine.

2500|$|The ADE 651 {{consists}} of a swivelling antenna mounted via a hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>must</b> walk {{for a few moments}} to [...] "charge" [...] it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific [...] "programmed substance detection card" [...] is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna {{in the direction of the}} target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to [...] "tune into" [...] the [...] "frequency" [...] of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. According to Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, using the device properly is more of an art than a science: [...] "If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try to clear my mind." [...] The cards were supposedly [...] "programmed" [...] or [...] "activated" [...] by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's [...] "vapours". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to [...] "program" [...] the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of [...] "programming" [...] them when demand for the devices was at its peak.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there is some}} {{evidence}} that operational practices are not easy to change. Operators almost never follow instructions and written procedures exactly, and “the violation of rules appears to be quite rational, given the actual workload and timing constraints under which <b>the</b> <b>operators</b> <b>must</b> do their job”. Many attempts to improve nuclear safety culture “were compensated by people adapting to the change in an unpredicted way”.|$|R
