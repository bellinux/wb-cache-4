5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys.

Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E
