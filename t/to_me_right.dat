She argued in a speech shortly before her nomination to the Court that [...] motions seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>right,</b> in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication. Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable." [...] Legal scholar Cass Sunstein has characterized Ginsburg as a [...] "rational minimalist", a jurist who seeks to build cautiously on precedent rather than pushing the Constitution towards her own vision.|$|E

Her first movie after that was Silk Stockings. Later in 1995, Wicked Pictures, a then small pornographic film production company, signed her to an exclusive contract. She remembers telling Wicked Pictures founder Steve Orenstein: [...] "The most important thing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>right</b> now is to become the biggest star the industry has ever seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor's {{originality}} {{has been}} emphasized by several critics writing of her work; thus Lynn Emanuel writes of Captive Voices, [...] "It {{is a complex}} and unexpected convergence of the influences of modernism and a wholly original, native genius. Reading it one suddenly realizes that one is {{in the presence of}} an American classic." [...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made me feel that poetry was contemporary and could relate <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>right</b> now, in the way that you know that all those wonderful heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E

2500|$|The {{influence}} of Iberian sculpture {{became an issue}} in 1939, when Alfred Barr claimed that the primitivism of the Demoiselles derived from the art of Côte d'Ivoire and the French Congo. Picasso insisted that the editor of his [...] "catalogue raissonne", Christian Zervos, publish a disclaimer: the 'Demoiselles,' he said, owed nothing to African art, everything to the reliefs from Osuna {{that he had seen}} in the Louvre a year or so before. Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero with Andre Malraux in June 1907, about which he later said [...] "When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>right.</b> The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things." [...] Maurice de Vlaminck is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of Fang extraction in 1904.|$|E
2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>right</b> away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
