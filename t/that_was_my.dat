Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed. After she reached the {{pinnacle}} of her profession, [...] "That’s when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started {{putting a lot of}} pressure on myself." [...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Soeman's {{characters}} are not identified as indigenous Indonesians, including Nona (her name being common among the ethnic Chinese) and Sir Joon (a Eurasian). This was, in part, {{a bid to}} attract readers of different cultural backgrounds, {{as well as those}} living in Singapore. It also served to soften Soeman's criticism. In an interview, Soeman recalled: [...] "My stories always challenged the stiff adat. So to show this, my characters were always outsiders, who could be better accepted if they went against adat. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> strategy, as an author, so my stories could be accepted." ...|$|E

500|$|The young Max {{was exposed}} to music early on, {{attending}} Broadway shows weekly {{from the age of}} two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He knew {{he wanted to be a}} drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on The Milton Berle Show in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, [...] "I think anybody who wanted to develop a life in rock 'n' roll music had a moment. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> moment," [...] and Fontana became a major influence on him.|$|E
500|$|People {{connected}} with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: [...] "I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." [...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." [...] Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production [...] "sounded way better than the other ones." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge {{dedicated}} a dam on the Gila River {{named in}} his honor. However, {{the state had}} just been through a long drought, and the reservoir {{which was supposed to}} be behind the dam was virtually dry. The humorist Will Rogers, who was also on hand as a guest speaker joked, [...] "If <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> lake, I'd mow it." [...] Phoenix's population had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118.

500|$|Although Stone {{recalled}} that “There {{was only one}} will in our family, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> father’s,” she described the family government characteristic of her day. Hannah Stone earned [...] a modest income through selling eggs and cheese but was denied any control over that money, sometimes denied money to purchase things Francis considered trivial. Believing she {{had a right to}} her own earnings, Hannah sometimes stole coins from his purse or secretly sold a cheese. As a child, Lucy resented instances of what she saw as her father’s unfair management of the family’s money. But she later came to realize that custom was to blame, and the injustice only demonstrated “the necessity of making custom right, if it must rule.” ...|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was released in 1999 which features Vives and a band performing song with various background montages. Vives performed the song at the 12th Lo Nuestro Awards which Magaly Morales of the Sun-Sentinel noted that his performance [...] "sent everybody up on their feet, swinging their hips". The song was included on his El Amor de Mi Tour track listing. He also performed the song at the 1st Latin Grammy Awards ceremony where Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe said that Vives [...] "brought the performances to an upbeat close". He was originally not going to perform at the Latin Grammy Awards due to his illness with pneumonia, but decided to go as {{he wanted to show}} [...] "something that was mine and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> country's".|$|E

500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Maureen Teefy, an {{established}} actress of Irish descent, was cast as Doris Finsecker, a shy and uptight Jewish girl. De Silva disagreed with Teefy's casting, stating, [...] "...I'd envisioned [...] as a 16-or 17-year-old Barbra Streisand from Brooklyn, and when [...] cast this Irish actress {{that was a}} trouble... <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> only reservation; I really had envisioned {{she was a young}} Barbra Streisand, a Jewish girl." [...] Parker and the casting department had difficulty finding an actress for the role of Hilary Van Doren. Antonia Franceschi, who had previously acted as a background dancer in the musical Grease (1978), secured the role based on the strength of her audition. Meg Tilly appears in her acting debut as a principal dancer. In his first credited screen role, Peter Rafelson, son of Bob Rafelson, appears as a principal musician and vocalist.|$|E
500|$|Futterman {{praised the}} return of Chenoweth's {{character}} April Rhodes, and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez said that she [...] "brings such lightness, humor and zaniness that's endearingly button-nose cute". Fallon wrote, [...] "Chenoweth's every sly smirk, eyebrow tick, and note sung—well, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> week's highlight." [...] Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged [...] "Chenoweth's amazing pipes", but added [...] "her character, which was thin to start with, has kind of worn out its welcome". The subplot of Will thinking about going to Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{said there was no}} tension at all because the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen called the entire scenario [...] "ludicrous", made even more so by the highly compressed time frame, and their dress rehearsal [...] "bizarre", criticisms echoed by Brown.|$|E

500|$|In 1949, {{he sought}} to become a Democratic leader in the Broadway {{district}} on Manhattan's west side. One of the two incumbent district leaders Broderick was challenging, Gerald V. Murphy, accused him of having been {{forced out of the}} department for associating with gangsters. The charge was confirmed by Manhattan's District Attorney, Frank Hogan, who disclosed that Broderick was forced to retire by Mayor William O'Dwyer after Hogan's office learned that in November 1946 he had accompanied a gambler and ex-convict, Ben Kaye, to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he [...] "associated with" [...] mobster Owney Madden. Broderick denied the charge, conceding that he was on the same plane as Kaye but that it was a [...] "coincidence." [...] He admitted that he knew Madden and [...] "every gangster in New York. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> job."

500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot.

I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{disappointed}} Indiana Jones fans {{used the}} term [...] "nuking the fridge", based on a scene where Jones survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, to denote the point when a franchise passes its peak and crossed into the absurd, similar to [...] "jumping the shark". This phrase has appeared across the internet, and was chosen as #5 on Time magazine's list of [...] "top ten buzzwords" [...] of 2008. Asked about the scene and phrase, Spielberg said: [...] "Blame me. Don't blame George. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> silly idea ... I'm proud of that.

She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of anything that I could do... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer.

And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, {{they will tell you}} what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ...
