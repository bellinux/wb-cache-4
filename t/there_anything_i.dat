500|$|Describing the {{diagnosis}} as an [...] "embuggerance" [...] {{in a radio}} interview, Pratchett appealed to people to [...] "keep things cheerful" [...] and proclaimed that [...] "we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism." [...] He stated {{he felt he had}} time for [...] "at least a few more books yet", and added that while he understood the impulse to ask [...] "is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> can do?", in this case he would only entertain such offers from [...] "very high-end experts in brain chemistry." [...] Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Derwent Garth Forster (born 29 June 1957) is an Australian singer-songwriter, guitarist {{and music}} critic. In December 1977 he co-founded an indie rock group, The Go-Betweens, with fellow musician, Grant McLennan. In 1980 Lindy Morrison {{joined the group}} on drums and backing vocals and by 1981 Forster and Morrison were also lovers. In 1988, [...] "Streets of Your Town", co-written by McLennan and Forster, became the band's biggest chart hit in both Australia and the United Kingdom. The {{follow-up}} single, [...] "Was <b>There</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>I</b> Could Do?", was a No.16 hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. In December 1989, after recording six albums, The Go-Betweens disbanded. Forster and Morrison had separated as a couple earlier and Forster began his solo music career from 1990.|$|E
2500|$|... 16 Lovers Lane (1988), was the group's most {{commercial}} offering, {{providing the}} alternative radio hit [...] "Streets of Your Town" [...] (1988), which entered the chart singles both the UK and Australia peaking in the Top 100 but not {{higher than the}} number 80. The follow-up single [...] "Was <b>There</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>I</b> Could Do?" [...] was a No.16 hit on US alternative Modern Rock radio stations, and Beggars Banquet, trying to encourage the band's commercial momentum re-released [...] "Streets of Your Town" [...] in the UK in early 1989, where it charted low once again. These minimal successes were hardly the hoped-for commercial breakthrough for the band, and after recording six albums, Forster and McLennan disbanded The Go-Betweens in December 1989. McLennan and Brown had separated as a couple earlier and both Forster and McLennan pursued solo careers. Brown and Morrison formed Cleopatra Wong in 1991. All official albums published in the 1980s have titles with a double L word, except 16 Lovers Lane, which has two words beginning with an L.|$|E
