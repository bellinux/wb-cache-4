Banks recorded a solo album A Curious Feeling in Polar Studios, Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album, Smallcreep's Day, at the same studio. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed.

Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spare,</b> and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E

At the time, all three Gruppen of JG77 were lent out to other units, and Gollob had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>spare,</b> so temporarily took over command of JG52 as acting Geschwaderkommodore. On this {{or one of the}} following days, he departed and flew to the Geschwaderstab of JG52. On 28 June 1942, the Wehrmacht had initiated Fall Blau (Case Blue), the 1942 strategic summer offensive in southern Russia. The objective was to secure the oil fields of Baku as well as an advance in the direction of Stalingrad along the Volga River, to cover the flanks of the advance towards Baku. Tasked with aerial support of this offensive was Luftflotte 4 to which JG52 was subordinated. By the time Gollob joined the Geschwader in late July 1942, the offensive had been renamed Operation Braunschweig and JG52 was located at Rostov-on-Don. Gollob claimed his first victory with the Stab of JG52 on 26 July 1942, a I-16 and his 108th in total. The next day, he shot down two I-153 biplane fighters. He claimed the first aerial victory of August 1942, his last month of combat operations, on 4 August over a Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter aircraft. He was then credited with four victories on 6 August, two Il-2, one Yak-1 and one R-5 took his score to 115 aerial victories. He claimed one Yak-1 on each of the next two days.

His success as a fighter pilot continued, as he shot down two LaGG-3 on 17 August, three I-16 on 18 August, and two Il-2 and a I-153 on 19 August, taking his overall total to 133 aerial victories.|$|E
