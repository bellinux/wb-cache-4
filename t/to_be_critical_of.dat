[...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and caked and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war. These militants should be made undergo a few nights in cheerless billets [...] mud-river trenches to teach them a lesson. What is it all for at all?".|$|E

[...] Scholars have tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the literary value of the poem, but consider it valuable as a historical source. [...] Much of the scholarship on the poem has focused on the question of who the speaker and the addressee in the poem are, and whether Charaxos and Larichos are the historical or fictional brothers of Sappho. [...] Others have discussed the place of the Brothers Poem in the corpus of Sappho's poetry, and its links with Greek epic, particularly the homecoming stories told in the Odyssey. [...] The lost initial stanza or stanzas of the poem have also been the subject of scholarly attention, with various reconstructions being put forward.|$|E

The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for [...] "Freedom".

500|$|The {{second major}} {{division}} in the church occurred over the day of worship, when Sabbatarians within the congregation wanted to worship on Saturday. [...] The practice was largely tolerated, with some parishioners attending one service, some attending another, and some attending both. [...] The elder Obadiah Holmes, however, was hostile to the practice, and was rebuked by Clarke in 1667 over his harshness towards the Sabbatarians. [...] Holmes subsequently withdrew from preaching at the Newport church, but resumed his pastoral duties there in 1671. [...] When he continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Sabbatarians, they finally left to form their own church in December 1671. [...] Additional dissension occurred in the church, centered on the family of Giles Slocum. [...] When Slocum's wife, Joan, denied that Christ was alive, she was excommunicated in 1673. [...] Following this, her husband, their children, and their children's spouses all left the church, and became Quakers.|$|E

500|$|What's the Story was {{released}} to lukewarm reviews {{from the mainstream}} music press. Many contemporary reviewers expressed disappointment at the album's perceived inferiority to Definitely Maybe, taking aim at the 'banal lyrics' and the unoriginal nature of the compositions. David Cavanagh of Q magazine said of the lyrics [...] "They scan; they fill a hole; end of story. They [...] nothing much about anything." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent commented that [...] "She's Electric" [...] is laddism of a tiresomely generic kind [...] "Roll With It" [...] is drab and chummy." [...] Perhaps the most damning review came from David Stubbs of the now-defunct Melody Maker. Despite stating that [...] "Some Might Say" [...] was [...] "the best single of the year", Stubbs went on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the album as a whole; [...] "What's the Story [...] laboured and lazy.

500|$|During the Mughal era, [...] "it was {{a common}} mode of {{execution}} in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant." [...] Captain Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan ordered an offending military commander to be carried [...] "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death". The Mughal Emperor Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor Jahangir, {{is said to have}} ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The French traveler François Bernier, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of Delhi, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces [...] "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".|$|E
500|$|McCay is a {{controversial}} figure in Australian history. Disagreement about his significance and reputation began {{before his death}} and continues to the present. General Sir Brudenell White considered McCay to be [...] "one of the greatest soldiers that ever served Australia, greater even than Monash." [...] McCay's achievements included {{the creation of the}} Military Board and the Australian Army Intelligence Corps, and the development of the Staff Corps, [...] "laying the foundations on which the Australian Army was built." [...] In writing Volume III of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, which covered 1916, official historian Charles Bean exonerated McCay of blame for Fromelles. This led to a public debate in the pages of The Bulletin in 1929 between critics of McCay and his defenders, led by Elliott. A revival of interest in Australian military history and the rediscovery of graves at Fromelles in the 21st Century led to a number of books being written about the battle, which tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> McCay.|$|E

500|$|Another of Przybylo's articles, Asexuality and {{the feminist}} {{politics}} of 'not doing it, published in 2011, takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality. Pryzyblo argues that asexuality {{is made possible}} only through the Western context of [...] "sexual, coital, and heterosexual imperatives". She addresses earlier works by Dana Densmore, Valerie Solanas, and Breanne Fahs, who argued for [...] "asexuality and celibacy" [...] as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy. While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy, she considers blurring the lines between the two to be productive for a feminist understanding of the topic. In her 2013 article, [...] "Producing Facts: Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex," [...] Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research - that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s, which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality, and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert's 2004 study (see above) and has popularized the subject and made it more [...] "culturally visible". In this article, Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon, and continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> its scientific study.|$|E
500|$|Lansdale {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> Durbrow, {{and wanted}} to replace him as ambassador. Two months later, the incoming US President John F. Kennedy started a review of Washington's stance with regards to Saigon. Lansdale's report predicted South Vietnam's demise, and along with it, the rest of South East Asia and US preeminence in global affairs, unless a new direction was found. He blamed {{what he saw as}} Durbrow's poor judgement for the problems in the alliance, and that the current ambassador could not work effectively anymore because he had [...] "sympathized strongly" [...] with the coup. Without explicitly suggesting himself, Lansdale said that Durbrow had to be replaced with someone [...] "with marked leadership talents" [...] and the ability to [...] "influence Asians through understanding them sympathetically". Lansdale called Diệm [...] "the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President" [...] and said the new ambassador needed thus needed to have a rapport with him. Lansdale said Diệm was comfortable with MAAG and the CIA, but felt that diplomats were [...] "very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11". During the meeting at which these matters were discussed, there was strong agreement that Durbrow's position in Saigon had become untenable. Lansdale's submissions were seen as being important in Kennedy's decision to replace Durbrow with Frederick Nolting in May 1961. Nolting was a mild man who was seen as unlikely to pressure Diệm to reform and therefore upset him. Kennedy was thought to have seriously contemplated the appointment of Lansdale, before encountering complaints from sections of the State and Defense Departments, among them Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Kennedy also increased funding for Diệm immediately and made a show of support for the Vietnamese leader at the advice of Lansdale.|$|E
