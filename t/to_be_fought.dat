5|$|The Action of 28January 1945 was an {{inconclusive}} naval {{battle of}} the Second World War fought between two British Royal Navy light cruisers and three Kriegsmarine (German navy) destroyers near Bergen, Norway. The battle was both the last of many actions between British and German warships off Norway during the war, and the second last surface engagement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> by the Kriegsmarine. It resulted in heavy damage {{to one of the}} German destroyers and light damage to another destroyer and both British cruisers.|$|E
5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained and could not be solved by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> again.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00, Schwarzenberg {{began to}} {{withdraw}} from the action, her forward rigging and forecastle burning badly. Tegetthoff decided to break off the engagement and fled to the neutral waters around Heligoland. As Tegetthoff's ships began with withdraw, one of them scored a hit on Jyllands rudder, which prevented Suenson from being able to effectively pursue the retreating Austrians and Prussians. McClintock took Aurora between the two squadrons to deter Suenson from pursuing Tegetthoff in violation of British neutrality. The two Austrian frigates had suffered a total of 36 men killed and 108 deadof those 31 killed and 81 wounded aboard Schwarzenbergand both vessels were damaged. The Danish vessels suffered 14 men killed and 54 wounded, and only Niels Juel was damaged in the action. The battle was the last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> solely by wooden warships, and it was also the last major naval action to involve the Danish Navy.|$|E

5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the attackers}} {{seem to have}} wanted to force the Jews to convert, {{although}} they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, {{did their best to}} protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home. The attacks on the Jews were witnessed by Ekkehard of Aura and Albert of Aix; among the Jewish communities, the main contemporary witnesses were the Mainz Anonymous, Eliezer ben Nathan, and Solomon bar Simson.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with the downside being that Vettel would have to do 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a stop-go penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, who was being harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E

25|$|An Ottoman armada, which, in {{addition}} to imperial warships, included squadrons from the eyalets (provinces) of Egypt, Tunis and Algiers, was destroyed by an Allied force of British, French and Russian warships. It was the last major naval battle in history <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> entirely with sailing ships, although most ships fought at anchor. The Allies' victory was achieved through superior firepower and gunnery.|$|E
25|$|While {{the fall}} of Lae was clearly {{a victory for the}} Allies, and it was {{achieved}} more quickly and at lower cost than anticipated, a significant proportion of the Japanese garrison had escaped through the Saruwaged Range, to the north of Lae, and would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> again elsewhere. The Huon Peninsula campaign was the result, and a quick follow up landing was subsequently undertaken at Scarlet Beach by the 20th Brigade.|$|E

25|$|The Oldham {{by-election}} of 1899 {{occurred in}} the summer of that year, and involved a by-election to fill both seats in the two-member Oldham Parliamentary borough. The block voting method allowed each elector to vote for two candidates. The election resulted in the Liberal Party winning both seats from the Conservatives who had previously held them; however the election is principally notable for being the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> by future Conservative Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
25|$|Later medieval navies {{continued}} to use similar tactics, with the line abreast formation as standard. As galleys were intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> from the bows, and were at their weakest along the sides, especially in the middle. The crescent formation employed by the Byzantines {{continued to}} be used throughout the Middle Ages. It would allow {{the wings of the}} fleet to crash their bows straight into the sides of the enemy ships {{at the edge of the}} formation.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese had {{realised}} {{that the}} operation {{ought to be}} broken off as early as May. Lieutenant General Hikosaburo Hata, the Vice-Chief of the General Staff, had made a tour of inspection of Southern Army's headquarters in late April. When he returned to Tokyo, he reported pessimistically {{on the outcome of}} the operation at a large staff meeting to Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, but Tojo dismissed his concerns as their source was a junior staff officer (Major Masaru Ushiro, at Burma Area Army HQ). Messages were sent from Imperial Headquarters, urging that the operation was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> to the end.|$|E

25|$|The first {{memorial}} to the duel was constructed in 1806 by the Saint Andrew's Society, of which Hamilton was formerly a member. A 14-foot marble cenotaph, consisting of an obelisk topped by a flaming urn and a plaque with a quote from Horace surrounded by an iron fence, was constructed approximately where Hamilton was believed to have fallen. Duels continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> at the site and the marble was slowly vandalized and removed for souvenirs, leaving nothing remaining by 1820. The memorial's plaque survived, turning up in a junk store and finding {{its way to the}} New-York Historical Society in Manhattan, where it still resides.|$|E
25|$|Eventually a {{fight was}} {{arranged}} between Welsh and Ritchie <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> in Vancouver on 4 September 1913, but when Welsh {{turned on his}} ankle in training the date was forced back to the 20th. Worse was to follow when the evening before the fight Ritchie left Vancouver, later citing unhappiness over the filming rights of the fight. Around the same time, a gold belt awarded to Welsh after he won the Commonwealth encounter with Mehegan, was stolen while on display at a tea room near his training quarters. The belt was recovered when an Australian, named Henry Beckett, was caught trying to smuggle {{it out of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|William Walker first gained {{national}} attention after his duel with William Hicks Graham on January 12, 1851 in San Francisco. At that time, Walker was {{the editor of}} the San Francisco Herald while Graham was a clerk in the employ of Judge R. N. Morrison. The conflict started after Walker criticized Graham and his colleagues in the newspapers, which angered and prompted Graham to challenge Walker to a duel. Graham was a notorious gunman and duellist in his time, having taken part in a number of duels and shootouts in the Old West. Walker on the other hand, had experience duelling with single-shot pistols at one time, but his duel with Graham was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> with revolvers.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} May—six {{months before}} the landslide 1972 federal election by the Labor Party under Gough Whitlam—the Country-Liberal coalition gained another comprehensive win at the 1972 Queensland election: Bjelke-Petersen's party took 26 seats with 20% of the vote, the Liberals took 21 seats with a 22.2% share of the vote and Labor got 33 seats from 46.7%. It was the first state election <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> following a 1971 electoral redistribution that added four seats to the parliament and created four electoral zones with a weightage towards rural seats, {{with the result that}} while Brisbane electorates averaged about 22,000 voters, some rural seats such as Gregory and Balonne had fewer than 7000.|$|E

25|$|The IBF {{installed}} George Groves as Froch's mandatory challenger, their bout {{taking place}} on Saturday 23 November at the Phones4u Arena in Manchester with Froch's IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles on the line. Despite being floored {{for only the second}} time in his career by a left hook right hand from Groves in the first round, Froch defended his titles with a TKO victory in Round 9. There was significant controversy as many observers felt that referee Howard Foster stepped in to end the contest prematurely. The three scoring judges had scored Groves ahead of Froch before Groves was shaken by some powerful Froch blows in the 9th. The controversial ending prompted a widespread demand for a rematch <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> between the two.|$|E
25|$|The 9th century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{mentions}} {{the arrival of}} the Saxon leaders Cerdic and Cynric in Britain (at Hampshire) in 495.
