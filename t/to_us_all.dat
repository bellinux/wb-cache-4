25|$|At 5:30pm on 30 May 1940 a {{telephone}} request {{was made by}} the naval officer in charge at Margate that the Lord Southborough be launched and go across the channel to Dunkirk to help in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army. The lifeboat with her coxswain Edward Parker and her crew aboard headed off to Dunkirk, along with 18 other lifeboats which had been commandeered to help. The Margate crew were one of only three RNLI lifeboat crews used in the evacuation that were allowed to take their own lifeboat across. Many of the others were crewed by Navy ratings. Lord Southborough was second to arrive at the Dunkirk beaches, with the Ramsgate lifeboat Prudential (ON 697) arriving a little before. The two lifeboats spent their first hours on the beaches ferrying soldiers from the shore to larger ships in deeper water off shore. The Lord Southborough has been credited with having brought off 600 military personnel from the beaches of Dunkirk, but the true figure is thought to be far greater than this. 500 of these were conveyed from the beach at La Panne to the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Icarus. The Commanding Officer of the destroyer, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Roper, said of the Lord Southborough’s crew On behalf of every officer and man on this ship, I should like to express to you our unbound admiration for the magnificent behaviour of the crew of the lifeboat Lord Southborough…. The manner in which, with no thought of rest, they brought off load after load of soldiers under continuous shelling, bombing and aerial machine-gun fire will be an inspiration <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> as long as we live. We are proud to be the fellow countrymen of such men. The Lord Southborough’s Coxswain Edward Parker was one of the two lifeboat coxswains who were awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their services at Dunkirk the other being Harold Knight coxswain of the Ramsgate Lifeboat.|$|E

Holmes has {{said that one of}} her favorite things about writing the series is being able to add in themes that apply <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> such as family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules. Other themes include [...] "death and spirituality and family and relationships". She also added in human themes such as [...] "starting at a new school (Rusty joining ThunderClan), falling in love with the wrong person (Graystripe and Silverstream) and being bullied by someone who should look after you (Tigerclaw bullying Ravenpaw)". To a reviewer for Kirkus Reviews, the human theme of fitting in was easily found and applauded when Rusty succeeds.|$|E

500|$|Regarding religion, Murphy had {{previously}} been verging on agnostic, but confirmed his atheism after researching {{his role as a}} nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film Sunshine. He was a vegetarian for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices. He began eating meat again for his role in Peaky Blinders. His political activity includes participating in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election, and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organization Focus Ireland. In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for [...] "highlighting [...] is hugely important <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> as a nation".|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{stated that}} while the song {{featured}} five distinct artists, Minaj actually had the brightest appearance on the song. Sara D. Anderson of AOL gave the song a positive review, complimenting each artist on their contribution. Chris Ryan of MTV positively reviewed West, Jay-Z and Minaj as the stand out rappers in the song, stating [...] "on car stereos, computers and in clubs all over, nothing got more burn than 'Monster,' his new beastly posse cut. Kanye spits about his presence being a present <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>all,</b> Jay-Z comes through with what might be his strongest verse in years, and that's where Nicki comes in, more than holding her own against the bad boys." [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal reported that Minaj gave the verse of her life, and applauded the contributions by Ross, who added a [...] "hallucinatory tone" [...] to the song. Another Pitchfork writer, Tom Breihan mused that the track contained the [...] "straight-up funkiest beat" [...] West has made in years, while commenting that Minaj was the best in show.|$|E
500|$|Amid the {{dismantling}} of apartheid in the early 1990s, various political parties competed over Biko's legacy, with several saying they were the party that Biko would support if he were still alive. AZAPO in particular claimed exclusive ownership over Black Consciousness. In 1994, the ANC issued a campaign poster suggesting that Biko {{had been a member}} of their party, which was untrue. Following the end of apartheid when the ANC formed the government, they were accused of appropriating his legacy. In 2002, AZAPO issued a statement declaring that [...] "Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon" [...] and that the ANC was [...] "scandalously" [...] using Biko's image to legitimise their [...] "weak" [...] government. Members of the ANC have also criticised AZAPO's attitude to Biko; in 1997, Mandela said that [...] "Biko belongs <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>all,</b> not just AZAPO." [...] On the anniversary of Biko's death in 2015, delegations from both the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters independently visited his grave. In March 2017, the South African President Jacob Zuma laid a wreath at Biko's grave to mark Human Rights Day.|$|E

[...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out," [...] said drummer Butch Trucks. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album.

500|$|Part of the {{enduring}} folklore of the Titanic sinking {{is that the}} musicians played the hymn [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee" [...] as the ship sank, but {{this appears to be}} dubious. The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking, and the hymn became so closely associated with the Titanic disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of Titanics bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished. Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played. In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then [...] "Autumn", by which he may have meant Archibald Joyce's then-popular waltz [...] "Songe d'Automne" [...] (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, Carpathia, who spoke with survivors, related: [...] "The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After Titanic struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs– anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken... various awe-stricken passengers began to think of the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'." [...] According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were [...] "cheerful" [...] but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper [...] "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>all</b> and one likely to create panic." [...] Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: [...] "I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. The next time I passed where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen." ...|$|E
