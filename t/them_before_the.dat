5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with <b>them.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple and slice of cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E

According to Louden, they were creating the animation for Ashmore's character, {{and did not}} have sufficient time to finalize <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> event, so they used their game prototype, which has Derry starring as the lead character, as the game's demo. The change in lead actors also prompted the studio to update and change the game cover art. Ashmore, Monaghan and Gillen were announced as the game's protagonists and antagonists a year later, and Derry starred in the game as Nick.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica, {{which was}} {{forecast}} {{to bear the}} brunt of Hurricane Dean, underwent the most extensive preparations. The Jamaican government executed long-standing evacuation plans, including converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political parties in the island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections, to allow residents to prepare for the storm. Curfews were put in place for parts of the island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work. More than 1,000 schools and churches were converted to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> storm's arrival. Evidently the country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4 emergency health kits and 1,000 water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stocks in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team tried to reach Jamaica, but only one member arrived before all incoming flights were canceled. The United States confirmed that it would offer aid if it was needed, and the North-West Caribbean Donor Group met to decide what actions would need to be taken.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings {{marked by}} {{powerful}} driving and pulling, dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked {{to use his}} feet {{to get to the}} ball on the half-volley so he could hit lofted drives. Of the 103 added for the last two wickets, Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before Toshack lasted the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston as his runner. Australia were 457/9 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. During Lindwall's partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls. Lindwall's partners were able to survive against the English pacemen, leading O'Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians. O'Reilly thought Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain nor dismiss the Australian tail.|$|E

They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event in a 5-on-2 elimination match. They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam, withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> match as directed by Mr. McMahon. At Unforgiven, D-Generation X then defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion Big Show in a 3-on-2 handicap Hell in a Cell match. During the match, DX embarrassed Vince by shoving his face in between Big Show's buttocks, and DX won when Triple H broke a sledgehammer over the shoulders of Mr. McMahon after Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on him.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, {{just out of the}} West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E

5|$|In reply, Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{came in at}} 6/329 on the third afternoon. With the fall of Sam Loxton and Saggers in quick succession, Bradman’s men were at 8/355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by {{powerful}} driving and pulling; he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet {{to get to the}} ball on the half-volley to hit lofted drives. Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets, the two tail-enders managed only 25 between them.

Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12.

Sunday was a rest day, and on Monday, the fourth morning, Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day, leaving Australia on 458, 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2010, Haas and Shelton Benjamin {{made their}} debut as Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team in Ring of Honor (ROH) losing to The Kings of Wrestling at the Glory By Honor IX pay-per-view. They {{returned}} to ROH at the Ring of Honor Wrestling television tapings on December 9, where they defeated the Bravado Brothers (Harlem and Lance).

At Final Battle 2011, Haas and Benjamin lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to the Briscoes despite severely attacking <b>them</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> match started, turning them into villainous characters. On May 12, 2012, at Border Wars, Haas and Benjamin regained the ROH World Tag Team Championship from the Briscoe Brothers. On June 24 at Best in the World 2012, Haas and Benjamin lost the title to Kenny King and Rhett Titus.
