5|$|A call like <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit ambiguous, {{but it was}} unsettling {{to those}} who were {{on the side of the}} status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{complexity}} of belief, indicated by various pieces of evidence, is disturbing to those looking for easy categories. The {{extent to which}} belief was discursive and free during the settlement period suggests a lack of proscription, indeed, <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> characteristic of Anglo-Saxon cultural success.|$|E

25|$|A war artist {{will have}} {{depicted}} {{some aspect of}} war through art; <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pictorial record or it might commemorate how war shapes lives.

25|$|An unintentional denial-of-service {{may also}} {{result from a}} prescheduled event created by the website itself, {{as was the case}} of the Census in Australia in 2016.

25|$|Aeschylus {{was born}} in c.525 BC in Eleusis, a small town about 27kilometers {{northwest}} of Athens, which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western Attica, though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was wealthy and well established; his father, Euphorion, {{was a member of}} the Eupatridae, the ancient nobility of Attica, though <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fiction that the ancients invented to account for the grandeur of his plays.|$|E

50|$|The {{discolored}} renia (Renia discoloralis) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> litter moth of the Erebidae family.

25|$|Typically, casuistic {{reasoning}} {{begins with}} a clear-cut paradigmatic case. In legal reasoning, for example, <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> precedent case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case like the paradigmatic case.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the tense}} {{situation}} and deplorable socio-cultural crime {{committed by the}} mob, Lafontaine proceeded cautiously, fought off armed thugs who had shot through his window, and maintained restraint and resolve in his actions. Jailed members of the mob were released on bail soon after their arrest and a force of special constables established to keep the peace. Though there was public concern <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> crushing blow to the reform movement, Lafontaine persevered despite the opposition, and would continue in his role developing the tenets of Canadian federalism – peace, order, and good government. Within a decade public opinion had shifted overwhelmingly {{in the development of}} a sovereign Canada.|$|E
25|$|He {{was one of}} the 12 sons of Cennétig mac Lorcáin (d. 951), king of Dál gCais {{and king}} of Tuadmumu (Thomond), modern County Clare, then a sub-kingdom in the north of Munster. Cennétig was {{described}} as rígdamna Caisil, meaning that he was either heir or candidate ("king material") to the kingship of Cashel or Munster, although <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> later interpolation. Brian's mother was Bé Binn inion Urchadh, daughter of Urchadh mac Murchadh (d. 945), king of Maigh Seóla in west Connacht. That they belonged to the Uí Briúin Seóla may explain why he received the name Brian, which was rare among the Dál gCais.|$|E

25|$|The {{maximum size}} of eruptions in each eruptive period though {{has been getting}} smaller through the more than 35,000-year history of modern Pinatubo, but <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{artifact}} of erosion and burial of older deposits. The oldest eruption of modern Pinatubo, Inararo, was also its largest.|$|R
25|$|Different {{regions of}} the world are {{researched}} very unevenly. The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population (Bloodtein, 1995. A Handbook on Stuttering). African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%. Many {{regions of the}} world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all (for example, in China). Some claim the reason for <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lower incidence in the general population in China.|$|E
25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E
25|$|Along with Jiangxi, Henan {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{unbalanced}} gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.|$|E
50|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, fermions are {{described}} by anticommuting spinor fields. A four-fermion interaction describes a local interaction between four fermionic fields at a point. Local here {{means that it}} all happens at the same spacetime point. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective field theory or it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> fundamental.|$|R

25|$|The clerk, {{standing}} in {{the centre of the}} portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sentimental love song. The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a pipe and tabor. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century. Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it is too short and has too many holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a flabiol instead. He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to be singing, and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E
25|$|The second {{goal was}} to help the {{creation}} of new institutions to conduct the research necessary to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In {{the early years of the}} epidemic there was little money or enthusiasm in the scientific community for such work. The threat of the epidemic was not apparent to most, as for example reflected in the Department of Health and Human Service recommendation to Congress in 1986 that only one million dollars be allocated to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for HIV/AIDS research. In the late summer of 1886 Rock Hudson fell in with AIDS in Paris and was airlifted to Los Angeles. Realizing that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> moment to begin to build support for HIV/AIDS research, Haseltine enlisted the help of Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he was working in the newly created American Foundation for AIDS Research (AMFAR), and members of the Lasker Foundation. In a six-week period this small group, with the support of Senators Ted Kennedy and Ted Stevens, were able to convince Congress to add about $320 million as a supplemental appropriation to the budget of NIH specifically for HIV/AIDS research (as recounted in the book Rapture). Haseltine was appointed to the Council of the National Institute of Allergy (NIAID) and Infectious disease to help direct how these funds were to be used. Over the next few years funding of HIV/AIDS research grew to about $2 billion per year. These funds have been instrumental in creating a powerful research institutions to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic, institutions which have trained many thousands of scientists and doctors and which continue to seek better ways to treat, cure and prevent the disease. Haseltine played an important early role in the creation of the International Society or AIDS Research and was the Founding editor of the scientific journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses.|$|E

500|$|The volcano was {{sporadically}} active {{during the}} Pleistocene, {{with the most}} recent eruption dated at 271,000 years ago. Since then, Uturunku has displayed fumarolic activity. Starting in 1992, satellite observations have indicated a large area of regional uplift centered on Uturunku, which has been interpreted {{as an indication of}} large-scale magma intrusion under the volcano. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> prelude to large-scale volcanic activity, including [...] "supervolcanic" [...] activity and caldera formation.|$|E
500|$|Austin and the Tejano leaders {{agreed to}} a compromise.

500|$|Aspen {{became more}} {{widespread}} after the fires, occupying areas {{that had been}} dominated by conifers. It had long been believed that aspen regenerated by sprouting from existing roots rather than by seed dispersal. However, aspen sprouts appeared {{two years after the}} fires as far as [...] from the nearest known aspen trees. Aspen is a preferred grazing food for elk and many of the newer aspen are consequently small, except in areas that are harder for elk to get to. The resurgence of aspen after the fires was a contrast to pre-fire events, as aspen had been increasingly scarce in the park. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> temporary event as conifers continue to grow and eventually crowd out other tree species.|$|E
