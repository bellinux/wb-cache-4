500|$|On December 28 at 2:56p.m., Alcorn's mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, {{posted a}} public {{message on the}} social media website Facebook, stating: [...] "My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>He</b> was out for an early morning walk and {{was hit by a}} truck. Thank you for the {{messages}} and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers." [...] Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private. The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that [...] "Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident. A moment of silence was held in Alcorn's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30.|$|E
500|$|McDermott {{said his}} character, Ryan Malloy, [...] "probably {{would have the}} balls to kill Archie" [...] {{and it would be}} a {{possibility}} due to the character's past, although he accused Janine of the murder, making it unlikely unless he was [...] "quite conniving." [...] He stated Ryan's only motive would be out of love for Janine. Glynis Barber, who plays Archie's first wife Glenda Mitchell and was not seen in the programme until after the murder, said her instinct was that Glenda did not kill Archie, even though she had been told it was possible. Bradley Branning's motive came from the discovery that Archie raped his partner Stacey, and Clements said that if other characters knew, it would give Bradley a motive and the fact that Bradley punched Archie would make him a prime suspect. He stated that he hoped Bradley was not the killer, though in an interview with daytime television show <b>This</b> <b>Morning,</b> <b>he</b> stated it would be [...] "quite historical to go down as the one who killed Archie Mitchell". The rape also gave Stacey a motive, and before she was sectioned in 2009 for bipolar disorder she accused Archie of trying to kill her. Jack Branning's motive came from his love for Ronnie and hatred of Archie, and he threatened Archie on Christmas Day. Maslen said it would be [...] "great" [...] if Jack was the murderer, but added that he may have taken the blame if Ronnie was guilty. Other possible suspects included Peggy's son Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), Billy Mitchell and Tracey the barmaid (Jane Slaughter). Slaughter said Tracey's only motive would be to protect The Queen Victoria or one of the Mitchells.|$|E
