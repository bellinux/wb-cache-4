500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|... "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a A−, calling it [...] "yet another adventure in weird, Native American mysticism from <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> 1013 Productions". VanDerWerff felt {{that although the}} episode contained several plot holes, it worked with [...] "a kind of dream sense, following its own weird, nightmare logic". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5. Gibron found that the episode contained several overly-unbelievable moments but was overall [...] "another great episode, even with some rather minor flaws". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "A Single Blade of Grass" [...] one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode was [...] "tedious", citing a lack of any real action and a [...] "banal" [...] ending which he described as having been poorly foreshadowed. However, Shearman felt positively about the episode's attempt to {{stand on its own}} rather than imitating sister show The X-Files, which he saw several prior episodes as having done.|$|E
500|$|The {{real-time}} {{episode was}} broadcast on 22 June 2011 in Australia and on 20 July in the UK. It was watched by 408,000 Australian viewers upon its first airing, making Neighbours the highest rated show on digital multi-channels that night. In the UK, {{an audience of}} 1.30 million watched the episode. For his work on [...] "Episode 6188", Dutton earned a nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama at the 2012 Australian Directors' Guild Awards. A TV Week website writer called the episode [...] "an edge-of-your-seat special", which was [...] "unmissable". The Sydney Morning Herald's readers gave the episode three out of five stars, while the paper's television critic, Andrew Murfett, commented [...] "The clock is omnipresent in tonight's 'real-time' Neighbours episode. The gimmick of the formatting – the episode unfolds in real time over an action-packed 30 minutes on Ramsay Street – means the clock appears almost every minute {{to remind us of}} what is a pressing deadline. It's a clever device for fans who have perhaps fallen out of touch with <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Erinsborough. In fact it's almost impossible not be at least mildly interested about the future prospects of Scott McGregor and Ashleigh Brewer in the aftermath of this 24-style ep." ...|$|E

The [...] "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering {{the chance to}} [...] "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim it for your own", was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, [...] "roughly" [...] equivalent to US$1.89. Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated [...] "Basically, it's Goonies." [...] "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage {{in search of the}} deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at US$2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners. One 1UP.com reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the [...] "complete" [...] Oblivion. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, [...] "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." [...] Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming PS3 release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: [...] "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?...Microtransactions are sticky business." [...] Joystiq continued to comment on the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] add-on in their notice of the quest's release. [...] "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?" [...] On July 13, [...] "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called [...] "Deepscorn Hollow" [...] for players bitten with Oblivions vampirism bug, was released. Like the [...] "Orrery" [...] and the [...] "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set [...] "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. [...] "What a bargain!...It's good to see <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Oblivion have learned their lesson and aren't offering relatively super expensive content not fit to see the light of day." ...|$|E

Jeb Bush, Carson, Cruz, and Rubio also appeared at a 2016 Republican presidential forum at BJU. Chip Felkel, a Greenville Republican consultant, {{noted that some}} of the candidates closely identified [...] "with <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Bob Jones.

2500|$|The British tanks {{returned}} {{during the}} first part of 1917, this time as part of the Battle of Arras. [...] Most directly affected on the German side was the IX Reserve Corps, in which at this point Thaer was serving as Chief of Staff. [...] Although, {{to the extent that they}} failed to achieve their military objectives, the Battle of Arras was seen as a defeat for the British, Thaer's diaries show that he was confirmed in his critical view of German military leadership: [...] "Faced with the tanks, our infantry reacted with terror, and indeed they were right since they were defenceless. [...] Infantry weapons made no impression. [...] Now a weapon is on its way that should cut through, but sadly <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> high command seem to incomprehensibly to underestimate the danger from the tanks".|$|E
2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was offered}} in two body styles: A 2-door formal hardtop and a 2-door SportsRoof, also a hardtop. All Sport models {{featured}} an integrated hood scoop, {{which was only}} functional with the optional and rare Ram Air Induction system. Also included with this model was twin colour-keyed racing mirrors, moulded door panels unique to the Sport model, body-side and wheel lip moldings, and F70-14 tires (E70-14 on hardtop models). A revised full body length laser stripe remained an option. It replaced the chrome side molding, and was available in four colours to match the exterior paint. For the driving enthusiast, the [...] "Rallye Equipment Group" [...] included the Instrumentation Group, Competition Suspension, G70-14 tires with raised white letters, and a Hurst shifter for those equipped with the 4-speed. The Rallye Equipment Group was available the 351CJ-4V or the 429-4V exclusively. The Competition Suspension was highly regarded by Tom McCahill of Mechanix illustrated, as well as Motor Trend and Car and Driver as being less harsh than past Torino performance suspensions, while still offering excellent handling. Motor Trend described the suspension as [...] "Unlike the super heavy-duty springs of years past, <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> Ford have managed to produce superior ride control without harshness. It takes a ride in one [...] to truly appreciate it." [...] Torino's new and improved chassis and suspension design {{can be attributed to}} this improvement.|$|E
