5|$|Ten years later, in 123 BC, Gaius {{took the}} same office as his brother, as a tribune for the plebeians. Gaius was more {{practical}} minded than Tiberius, and so was considered more dangerous by the senatorial class. He gained support from the agrarian poor by reviving the land reform programme and from <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poor</b> with various popular measures. He also sought support from the second estate, those equestrians who had not ascended to become senators.|$|E
5|$|The Gracchus brothers, Tiberius and Gaius, were Romans {{who both}} served as tribunes {{in the late}} 2nd century BC.

While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913–18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially. The Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church took exception to his liberal theological views, which some regarded as heretical, and sought unsuccessfully in 1917 to block his appointment as Bishop of Hereford.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had urban backgrounds, and the {{majority}} of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants. In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poor,</b> attempting to gain {{at the expense of the}} local elites. In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other urban rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.|$|E

The most important examples are in Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Tunja, Montería, Palmira, Girardot, and Riohacha. Operators are to a large extent Colombian.

5|$|Octavia Hill was the {{daughter}} of James Hill, corn merchant, follower of Owenism and banker, and his third wife, Caroline Southwood Smith. He had been widowed twice, and had six children (five daughters and a son) from his previous marriages. He had been impressed by the writings on education of Caroline Southwood Smith, {{the daughter}} of Dr Thomas Southwood Smith, a pioneer of sanitary reform. He had engaged Caroline as a governess for his children in 1832, and they were married in 1835, three years before Octavia was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, her father's eighth daughter and ninth child. The family's comfortably prosperous life was disrupted by James Hill's financial problems and his mental collapse. In 1840 he was declared bankrupt. Caroline Hill's father gave the family financial support, and took on some of Hill's paternal role. Southwood Smith was a health and welfare reformer concerned with a range of social issues including child labour in mines and the housing of <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poor.</b> Caroline Hill held similar views on social reform, and her interest in progressive education, influenced by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and Southwood Smith's daily experience in his work at the London Hospital in the East End inspired Octavia Hill's concern for the poorest in early Victorian London. She received no formal schooling: her mother educated the family at home.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poor</b> eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

40|$|Rapid and {{uncontrolled}} urbanisation across low {{and middle-income}} countries {{is leading to}} ever expanding numbers of <b>urban</b> <b>poor,</b> defined here as slum dwellers and the homeless. It is estimated that 828 million people are currently living in slum conditions. If governments, donors and NGOs are to respond to these growing inequities they need data that adequately represents the needs of <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poorest</b> {{as well as others}} across the socio-economic spectrum. We report on the findings of a special session held at the International Conference on Urban Health, Dhaka 2015. We present an overview of the need for data on urban health for planning and allocating resources to address urban inequities. Such data needs to provide information on differences between urban and rural areas nationally, between and within urban communities. We discuss the limitations of data most commonly available to national and municipality level government, donor and NGO staff. In particular we assess, with reference to <b>the</b> WHO’s <b>Urban</b> HEART tool, <b>the</b> challenges in the design of household surveys in understanding urban health inequities. We then present two novel approaches aimed at improving the information on the health of <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poorest.</b> <b>The</b> first uses gridded population sampling techniques within the design and implementation of household surveys and <b>the</b> second adapts <b>Urban</b> HEART into a participatory approach which enables slum residents to assess indicators whilst simultaneously planning the response.

40|$|Today, about 1 {{billion people}} are {{estimated}} to live in ‘slums’ worldwide. This number will only grow and urban poverty worsen unless radical measures are taken. While it is generally acknowledged in the international development debate that breaking the circle of poverty requires multiple strategies, there is renewed attention for approaches that centre {{on the issue of}} tenure security. This means landholders are protected against involuntary removal from the land on which they reside, unless through due process of law and payment of proper compensation. The prevailing approach to the provision of tenure security is land registration. And while the land registration approach currently dominates policy, there has been little research into the effects of registration, particularly in urban areas. What research has been conducted, contests the benefits of this approach. As a result, we witness increasing interest in alternative approaches which generally combine protective administrative or legal measures against eviction with the provision of basic services and credit facilities. The author describes and analyses the extent to which formal, semiformal, and informal tenure arrangements that can be found in kampongs (typical low-income settlements) in Indonesia provide tenure security to <b>the</b> country’s <b>urban</b> <b>poor,</b> particularly since 1998, when Indonesia embarked on an ambitious political and legal reform programme. The author reviews the current legal framework that applies to urban land tenure in Indonesia. In addition, based on rich material that was acquired through empirical research in the city of Bandung, {{there are a number of}} case studies presented in which <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poor’s</b> tenure security was put to the test. Finally, drawing on statistical data, the author analyses <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>poor’s</b> perceptions regarding their tenure security and whether and, if so, how this influences their housing investment behaviour. Following this analysis, the author evaluates the socio-economic benefits of current approaches to attaining tenure security. And with these findings, there are policy suggestions and contributions to theory formation presented to further the current international development debate on tenure security. Promotor: J. M.
