40|$|How do Americans {{acquire the}} {{impression}} that their political foes have some understandable basis for their views, and thus represent a legitimate opposition? How do they {{come to believe that}} reasonable <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> on any given political controversy? Given that few people talk regularly to those of opposing perspectives, some theorize that mass media, and television in particular, serve as an important source of exposure to the rationales for oppositional views. A series of experimental studies suggests that television does, indeed, have the capacity to encourage greater awareness of oppositional perspectives. However, common characteristics of televised political discourse cause audiences to view oppositional issue perspectives as less legitimate than they would have otherwise. I discuss the broader implications of these findings for assessments of the impact of television on the political process, and for the role that televised political discourse may play in encouraging polarized political views...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{algorithmic}} fairness has highlighted ethical questions {{which may not}} have purely technical answers. For example, different algorithmic fairness constraints are often impossible to satisfy simultaneously, and choosing between them requires value judgments about which <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree.</b> Here we investigate whether people's beliefs about algorithmic fairness correlate with their demographic backgrounds, a question of interest because computer science is demographically non-representative. If beliefs about algorithmic fairness correlate with demographics, and algorithm designers are demographically non-representative, decisions made about algorithmic fairness may not reflect {{the will of the}} population as a whole. We show in two separate surveys that gender correlates with beliefs about algorithmic fairness. For example, women are significantly less likely to favor including gender as a feature in an algorithm which recommends courses to students if doing so would make female students less likely to be recommended science courses...|$|R

People who have not been raised in a vegetarian culture adopt vegetarian diets for a variety of reasons, ethical, environmental or health-oriented. But is a vegetarian diet really healthy? More urgently, is it acceptable for a family to eliminate meat or, in the case of veganism, all animal products from their diet and to place these same restrictions upon their children?

40|$|In {{this essay}} Professor Deutsch {{examines}} {{the legitimacy of}} judicial review, in part {{as a response to}} recent works by three faculty members of the Harvard Law School—John Hart Ely, Laurence Tribe, and Frank Michelman. Because {{of the nature of the}} response, this essay may also be read as a counterpoint to the articles by Professors Mark Tushnet and Gary Leedes presented in this issue. Professor Deutsch contends that questions of legitimacy are endemic to processes of political choice, whether legislative or judicial Thus, criticisms or justifications of judicial review are flawed to the extent they assume the burden of legitimacy to be different for courts than for other political actors in a democracy. For Professor Deutsch, the legitimacy of all political processes—that is, their ability to reach outcomes about which <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> without endangering fundamental institutional values—turns instead on whether those processes achieve what the polity acknowledges in retrospect to have been acceptable goals, a judgment that will itself be shaped by preceding political choices. Institutional features such as the traditions of judicial conference and opinion—and the special role of precedent identified by Professor Deutsch—help to ensure the legitimacy of judicial choices in conflict with those of representative bodies. While changes in modern society may render the task of understanding the precedential value of recent judicial opinions uncertain, it is still the bond of precedent that fortifies the foundations of judicial review...|$|R
40|$|Critics of {{comparative}} risk assessment (CRA), the increasingly common practice of juxtaposing disparate risks {{for the purpose}} of declaring which one is the "larger" or the "more important," have long focused their concern on the difficulties in accommodating the qualitative differences among risks. To be sure, <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> vehemently about whether "larger" necessarily implies "more serious," but the attention to this aspect of CRA presupposes that science can in fact discern which of two risks has the larger statistical magnitude. This assumption, encouraged by the indiscriminate calculation of risk ratios using arbitrary point estimates, is often incorrect: the fact that environmental and health risks differ in unknown quantitative respects is at least as important a caution to CRA as the fact that risks differ in known qualitative ways. To show how misleading CRA can be when uncertainty is ignored, this article revisits the claim that aflatoxin contamination of peanut butter was " 18 times worse" than Alar contamination of apple juice. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the number 18 is shown to lie within a distribution of plausible risk ratios that ranges from nearly 400 : 1 in favor of aflatoxin to nearly 40 : 1 in the opposite direction. The analysis also shows that the "best estimates" of the relative risk of aflatoxin to Alar are much closer to 1 : 1 than to 18 : 1. The implications of these findings for risk communication and individual and societal decision-making are discussed, with an eye toward improving the general practice of CRA while acknowledging that its outputs are uncertain, rather than abandoning it for the wrong reasons...|$|R
40|$|FIRST PARAGRAPHS] Philosophers often talk as if what {{it takes}} {{for a person to}} persist through time were up to us, as {{individuals}} or as a linguistic community, to decide. In most ordinary situations it might be fully determinate whether someone has survived or perished: barring some unforeseen catastrophe, it is clear enough that you will still exist ten minutes from now, for example. But {{there is no shortage of}} actual and imaginary situations where it is not so clear whether one survives. Here reasonable <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree.</b> There are "fission" cases where each of one's cerebral hemispheres is transplanted into a different head; Star-Trek-style "teletransportation" stories; actual cases of brain damage so severe that one can never again regain consciousness, even though one's circulation, breathing, digestion, and other "animal" functions continue; and stories where one's brain cells are gradually removed and replaced by cells from someone else, to name only a few favorites. In many such cases we say, correctly, that the person in question has perished; that is the right answer to the question, Has she survived? But in some of those very situations, we are told that it might have been correct to give the opposite answer, and say that the person perished [...] even if nothing different happened to her. Some philosophers say that we are free to choose at random between saying that the person has survived and saying that she has ceased to exist; both are equally correct descriptions of the same event. Others say that a different answer to the question, Has the person survived? is in fact false, but would be true if we had a different concept of personal identity, or if our conventions for individuating people were different [...] in short, if we thought and spoke differently...|$|R
40|$|Most {{critiques of}} the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s June 2008 {{decision}} in Boumediene v. Bush (including Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s dissent in the same) have at their core {{the argument that}} Justice Kennedy 2 ̆ 7 s majority opinion is inconsistent with prior precedent, specifically the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1950 decision in Johnson v. Eisentrager. A closer read of Eisentrager, though, reveals a surprisingly unclear opinion by Justice Jackson, that seems {{to go out of}} its way to reach various issues on the merits even after suggesting that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over habeas petitions filed by 22 Germans convicted of war crimes by a U. S. military tribunal in China. Put another way, it is hard to understand the scope of the rule that the Eisentrager majority thought it was enunciating, and therefore the extent to which it should have also applied in the Guantanamo cases. This problem is not unique to Eisentrager, though. In the Court 2 ̆ 7 s June 2008 decision in Munaf v. Geren, it also brushed aside a post-World War II precedent [...] the 1948 decision in Hirota v. MacArthur, again because it was not clear exactly which facts the earlier jurisdiction-precluding decision relied upon. As I explore in this essay [...] part of the Tulsa Law Review 2 ̆ 7 s annual Supreme Court review [...] these decisions are emblematic of a judicial methodology that is no longer in vogue, thanks to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1998 decision in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment. After Steel Co., federal courts can no longer reach issues over which they lack jurisdiction, and so are far more careful to resolve jurisdictional questions at the outset, before moving on (where possible) to the merits. But what effect does Steel Co. have on prior precedent, where the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision leaves unclear how much the merits actually mattered? As I explore in this essay, Steel Co. may itself compel that contemporary courts narrowly construe jurisdiction-precluding rules in cases like Eisentrager and Hirota, on the assumption that those courts would not have analyzed questions the answers to which could not have mattered. Reasonable <b>people</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> about whether Boumediene and Munaf were rightly decided, but the critical point for present purposes is that both were decided on jurisprudential clean slate...|$|R
5000|$|The {{court will}} quash a {{decision}} where the authority has misunderstood a legal term or incorrectly evaluated {{a fact that}} is essential for deciding {{whether or not it}} has certain powers. So, in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khawaja 1984 AC 74, the House of Lords held that the question whether the applicants were [...] "illegal immigrants" [...] was a question of fact that had to be positively proved by the Home Secretary before he could use the power to expel them. The power depended on them being [...] "illegal immigrants" [...] and any error in relation to that fact took the Home Secretary outside his jurisdiction to expel them. However, where a term to be evaluated by the authority so broad and vague that reasonable <b>people</b> <b>may</b> reasonably <b>disagree</b> about its meaning, it is generally for the authority to evaluate its meaning. For example, in R v Hillingdon Borough Council ex Parte Pulhofer 1986 AC 484, the local authority had to provide homeless persons with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple, who lived with their two children in one room and applied to the local authority for aid. The local authority refused aid because it considered that the Pulhofers were not homeless and the House of Lords upheld this decision because whether the applicants had accommodation was a question of fact for the authority to determine.|$|R

2500|$|The {{politics}} of neuromarketing is {{this idea of}} using advertisements to convince {{the mind of a}} voter to vote for a certain party. This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go {{back to the days of}} the recalled governor, Gray Davis. In normal marketing, voters would use [...] "detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor". However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also <b>people</b> that <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> with this idea. Darryl Howard, [...] "a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial clients in 2010". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.|$|R
40|$|Norman Daniels' and James Sabin's {{theory of}} “accountability for reasonableness” (A 4 R) {{is a much}} {{discussed}} account of due process for decision-making on health care priority setting. Central to the theory is the acceptance that <b>people</b> <b>may</b> justifiably <b>disagree</b> on what reasons it is relevant to consider when priorities are made, but {{that there is a}} core set of reasons, that all centre on fairness, on which there will be no disagreement. A 4 R is designed as an institutional decision process which will ensure that only those reasons which everybody will agree are relevant and appropriate form part of decision-making. The argument which we will put forward in this paper questions whether it is a simple matter to delineate the core set of reasons and claims that it is a potential problem in A 4 R that it does not provide an indication of the exact content of this process. The paper first briefly outlines the content of A 4 R. It is argued that disagreement on what services should be high priorities cannot be resolved solely with a reference to “due process. ” In order to retain consistency over time, decision-makers are required to agree and articulate what reasons qualify as relevant and how conflicting reasons are to be balanced {{in the course of the}} process. The second and main part of the paper then considers how the reason of “solidarity” can be handled within the A 4 R framework, and it is shown that deciding whether solidarity should be admitted to the core set of allowable reasons is not a simple matter...|$|R
40|$|Enabling less highly-trained {{hospital}} {{workers to}} play a bigger role could improve jobs for doctors and nurses, save public hospitals nearly $ 430 million a year and fund treatment for more than 85, 000 extra people, argues this report. Overview Hospitals are under pressure. They face rising demand, a squeeze on funding and skills shortages in key areas. They have to change. One problem is that too many health professionals squander their valuable skills on work that other people could do. In most cases, it doesn’t take 15 years of post-school training to provide light sedation for a stable patient having a simple procedure. Nor does it take a three-year degree to help someone bathe or eat. But tradition, professional culture and industrial agreements often dictate that highly-trained health professionals spend their time doing straightforward work. This wastes money, makes professional jobs less rewarding and often does not improve care. There are many ways that hospitals can get a better match between workers and their work. This report looks at three examples. The first is using more nursing assistants to provide basic care to patients. The second is letting specialist nurses do common, low-risk procedures currently done by doctors. The third is employing more assistants to support physiotherapists and occupational therapists. These changes can maintain or improve the safety and quality of care. They are among the easiest to take up. Hospitals don’t have to be reorganised or new professions created. They would save public hospitals $ 430 million a year. That could fund treatment for more than 85, 000 extra people. These ideas are supported by solid evidence. They have been tried successfully in Australia, with good results for patients. Hospital CEOs we surveyed for this report strongly support them. Despite all this, progress is painfully slow. Formidable barriers {{in the form of}} regulations, culture, tradition and vested interests stand in the way. We need a new mechanism to overcome these barriers – a way to get from isolated trials to broad change. Creating that mechanism is even more important than the examples in this report. <b>People</b> <b>may</b> <b>disagree</b> with specific examples. But no-one can argue that all hospital work is done by the right person, or that a good way currently exists to get change throughout the system. Two things are needed. Hospitals, regulators and professional bodies must improve rules and regulations. State governments must invest money and expertise in spreading good practices. If we don’t update workforce roles, there will be a cost. Hospitals already struggle to provide enough care. Waiting lists are long and demand is growing fast. It’s hard to keep some hospital workers in their jobs. Government budgets are also under pressure. If action isn’t taken to make hospitals more efficient, tougher decisions about who will miss out on care are inevitable. Current workforce roles were designed {{in the days of the}} horse and buggy. The choice to update them should be easy. It means more and better care, more rewarding jobs for hospital professionals and a more sustainable system...|$|R
