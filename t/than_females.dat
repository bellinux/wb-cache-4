5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} exists {{among the}} river otters. Males are, on average, 5% larger <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> In Idaho, juvenile, yearling, and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, <b>than</b> <b>females</b> {{of the same}} age. A clinical reduction in size may exist {{from north to south}} along the Pacific coast, but not from east to west.|$|E
5|$|They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being {{consistently}} {{smaller than}} males. The size difference {{between males and}} females is proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> Males also have wider forepaw pads <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> enabling gender to be told from tracks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} this study are {{consistent}} with findings from a range of health care systems describing higher expenditures for medicine cost and diagnostic care for male <b>than</b> <b>female.</b> Considering the different types of sex specific healthcare services (Table  3) medicine cost is significantly higher in male <b>than</b> <b>female.</b> In childhood period, health care expenditure for male is slightly higher <b>than</b> <b>female</b> which showed the similar findings of other study in Bangladesh (Sarker et al. 2013) and this paper addressed some inequality in case of medicine cost that it provided less frequent in male <b>than</b> <b>female.</b>|$|R
40|$|We examine {{behavioral}} {{gender differences}} and gender pairing effects {{in a laboratory}} experiment with face-to-face alternating-offers wage bargaining. Our results suggest that male players are able to obtain better bargaining outcomes <b>than</b> <b>female</b> players. Male employees get higher wages <b>than</b> <b>female</b> employees. Male employers pay lower wages to <b>female</b> employees <b>than</b> <b>female</b> employers pay to male employees. Moreover, we find {{gender differences in the}} first offers of the bargaining game...|$|R
50|$|Male signal {{frequency}} is more heritable <b>than</b> <b>female</b> {{preference for}} certain frequencies. This {{means that there}} is more selection pressure on male signal frequency <b>than</b> <b>female</b> preference. Female choice might actually be the selection pressure that drove the divergence of male signal frequency in the E. binotata species complex.|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} of the loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are wider and less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, laparoscopy (an operation performed on the abdomen), histological examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with radiolabeling).|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{both male and}} female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing their mates. In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{examining}} {{sexual assault}} have consistently found that male participants blamed rapists less <b>than</b> <b>female</b> participants did, and that male participants blamed the rape victims more <b>than</b> <b>female</b> participants did. These findings support Shaver's similarity-responsibility hypothesis: male participants, who are personally similar to (male) rapists, blame rapists less <b>than</b> <b>female</b> participants who are dissimilar to rapists. On the other hand, female participants, who are personally similar to (female) rape victims, blame the victims less than male participants.|$|R
5000|$|Scientists {{have found}} that between male and female, there are higher amount of linalool and 2,3-butanediol present in male <b>than</b> in <b>female.</b> Male also elicits {{stronger}} odour <b>than</b> <b>female</b> does.|$|R

5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> measuring 90cm (35in) in length and weighing up to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). This is only 60% {{of the weight of}} a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen of all mantises {{consists}} of 10 tergites, with a corresponding set of nine sternites visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen {{tends to be}} slimmer in males <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> but ends {{in a pair of}} cerci in both sexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{disorder}} has {{a female}} predominance. The typical age of adolescent onset is 12.9, {{give or take}} 0.4 years (±), with males affected sooner <b>than</b> <b>females</b> (11.0 ± 0.8 for males versus 13.8 ± 0.5 for females).|$|E

5|$|The hawksbill {{sea turtle}} {{has been shown}} to be biofluorescent and is the first reptile {{recorded}} with this characteristic. It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral Physogyra lichtensteini. Males have more intense pigmentation <b>than</b> <b>females,</b> and a behavioural role of these differences is speculated.|$|E
5|$|Total {{length is}} , tail length , hind foot length , and body mass , with males {{slightly}} larger <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> The largest individuals occur in Florida {{and along the}} Gulf Coast east of the Mississippi River delta.|$|E
5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for more than a year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E

5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males {{have some}} buff {{markings}} on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perijá National Park in Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster <b>than</b> <b>females.</b>|$|E

5|$|Croup is a {{relatively}} common condition that affects about 15% of children at some point. It most commonly occurs between 6 months and 5 years of age but may rarely be seen in children as old as fifteen. It is slightly more common in males <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> It occurs most often in autumn. Before vaccination, croup was frequently caused by diphtheria and was often fatal. This cause is now very rare in the Western world due {{to the success of}} the diphtheria vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious {{neurological}} disorders affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It is more common in males <b>than</b> <b>females</b> with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|On average {{within any}} one population, males {{tend to have}} fewer spots on the {{underside}} and are paler in colour <b>than</b> <b>females.</b> The latter are also larger with a strong female T. alba of a large subspecies weighing over 550g (19.4oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings are covered in white down, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.|$|E

40|$|Background: Male {{breast cancer}} is {{relatively}} rare, comprising only 0. 7 % of all breast cancer cases. Male breast cancer usually presents with a palpable, nontender, retroareolar mass and occasional bloody discharge from the nipple. The typical age at presentation is between 60 and 70 years old (mean age of 67), which is significantly later <b>than</b> <b>female</b> presentation. Male {{breast cancer is}} generally diagnosed at a more advanced stage <b>than</b> <b>female</b> breast cancer...|$|R
