Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. <b>The</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.|$|E
5|$|Resources {{and funds}} {{were needed to}} {{construct}} most memorials, particular larger monuments or building projects; sometimes professional services could be acquired for nothing, but normally designers, workmen and suppliers had to be paid. Different countries approached this problem in various ways, depending on local culture {{and the role of}} the state.

Such demands {{have been successfully}} addressed by highly decentralized key-value stores invariably governed by a distributed hash table. The availability of these structured overlays rests on the assumption of a moderately stable environment. However, as scale grows with unprecedented numbers of nodes the occurrence of faults and churn becomes the norm rather than the exception, precluding the adoption of rigid control over the network's organization. In this position paper we outline the major ideas of a novel architecture designed to handle today's very large scale demand and its inherent dynamism. The approach rests on the well-known reliability and scalability properties of epidemic protocols to minimize the impact of churn. We identify several challenges that such an approach implies and speculate on possible solutions to ensure data availability and adequate access performance...|$|R

There are several key technologies that can help you get a handle on your big data, and more importantly, extract meaningful value from it. ...|$|R
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E

30|$|This {{refugee crisis}} in the {{neighborhood}} of the European Union put EU policies and institutions dealing with refugees and asylum seekers under heavy pressure to reform. The emergency humanitarian situation and <b>the</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> involved acted as stress-tests for the “Common European Asylum System” (CEAS). It is only fair to say that, by and large, the system was unable to provide appropriate responses to the new situation. In Guterres’ words: “If we fail to provide adequate support to refugees and their hosts, and to build up their resilience to cope with the long-term pressures of this increasingly protracted refugee situation, we risk a further destabilization of the entire region.” 2 Sadly enough, the CEAS remained largely virtual for a long time, prompting strong criticism of its legal framework (see De Bruycker et al., 2010); at the same time, the pressure to “do something” generated frantic policy experimentation, with a succession of spectacular but often short-lived initiatives, such as the “Mare Nostrum” operation (Fargues and Bonfanti, 2014; Fargues and Di Bartolomeo, 2015).|$|R

40|$|Peak-season {{visitors}} to Yosemite Valley know first-hand that use levels {{can affect the}} quality of their experiences in <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> of vehicles and people sometimes produce long lines at entrance gates, traffic jams at intersections, full parking lots, and congested trails or viewpoints. These problems have been challenging the park’s infrastructure and operational staff for decades, but more frequently in recent years (White et al. 2012). A 2011 study of mid-summer river users in Yosemite Valley also helps quantify the general problem: 82 % report feeling some degree of crowding during their visits (Whittaker and Shelby 2012). Meta-analyses of the hundreds of studies using this same measure suggest that recreation settings with crowding levels above 65 % are probably “over capacity, ” and those above 80 % may be “greatly over capacity ” (Shelby et al. 1989; Vaske and Shelby 2008). More detailed information shows that Yosemite visitors feel more crowded while using the park’s transportation system than when participating in other activities. The percentage of those feeling crowded was highest while engaged in driving roads (90 %), finding parking (88 %), or riding free shuttles (83 %), followed by hiking or biking on trails (68 %). In contrast, crowding ratings were considerably lower for river-based activities, such as boating (60 %) ...|$|R
