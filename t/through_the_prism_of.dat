5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E

25|$|This {{emphasis}} {{on the relationship between}} anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> their culture.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Simons was also able to finally finish a {{historical}} work {{which he had been}} working for years, a book entitled Social Forces in American History, published by the commercial publisher Macmillan & Co. in 1911. Simons' book was a temperate survey of American history from the age of discovery through Civil War reconstruction written <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> class struggle. Although Simons professed that he was writing as a Marxist, the tone and content of the work was so moderate that some reviewers did not even recognize the book as a socialist document.|$|E
50|$|Kristeva argues her {{writings}} {{have been}} misunderstood by American feminist academics. In Kristeva's view, {{it was not}} enough simply to dissect the structure of language in order to find its hidden meaning. Language should also be viewed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences. This post-structuralist approach enabled specific social groups to trace the source of their oppression to the very language they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to posit collective identity above individual identity, and that this political assertion of sexual, ethnic, and religious identities is ultimately totalitarian.|$|R

25|$|Cunningham's novel {{also uses}} the device in Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway of placing {{the action of}} the novel within the space of one day.

In Cunningham's book it is one day in the life of each of the three central characters; Clarissa Vaughan, Laura Brown and Virginia Woolf herself.

25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> submission and control. This {{is apparent in}} the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{tendency}} for governments to view issues <b>of</b> international economics <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> national security and foreign policy. The GFC was seen not just as an economic catastrophe, but as a security challenge. Other examples of a tendency to mingle economics and geo-politics include policy debates over: {{the implications of the}} economic rise of China; Beijing’s exchange rate policy; the rise of state capitalism in general, and of inward investment by SWFs and state owned enterprises in particular; and the growing focus on resource security.

500|$|The {{secret to}} Lord's success, {{according}} to the New York Herald Tribunes critic Stanley Walker, was that he used [...] "a kind of literary pointillism, the arrangement of contrasting bits of fact and emotion in such a fashion that a vividly real impression of an event is conveyed to the reader." [...] Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> social class, which had been the usual style of previous narratives, and instead successfully depicted the human element of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class.|$|E
500|$|In October 1939 The Rules of the Game {{was officially}} banned in France for being [...] "depressing, morbid, immoral [...] having an {{undesirable}} {{influence over the}} young." [...] Other films that were similarly banned included Marcel Carné's Le Quai des brumes and Le Jour Se Lève. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated [...] "we are especially anxious to avoid representations of our country, our traditions, and our race that changes its character, lie about it, and deform it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> an artistic individual who is often original but not always sound." [...] The Marriage of Figaro, one of the inspirations for the film, had also been banned for similar reasons. After the end of World War II the 85-minute version of the film was re-released in Paris on September 26, 1945, and it was again banned.|$|E
500|$|In The Boston Globe, H.W.

Reviewing for The Christian Science Monitor, Randy Dotinga wrote that the book's close examination of [...] "dry and tedious" [...] political debates [...] "makes for rough sledding at times", and criticized Ellis' dismissal of academic historians.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore how self-identity is (re) {{constructed}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> narrative act of autobiography in Doris Lessingâ€™s Under My Skin, Volume 1, 1919 - 1949 (1995).

It also seeks to interrogate how this process of identity formation is realised <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> memory, history, culture and social environment and the unconscious self. The fluid or provisional nature of identity, and the subjective nature of the above factors will be critically examined in an attempt to better understand the nature of life narratives in the broad scope of literary study...|$|R

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} …And Justice for All is conceptually unified around notions of {{political}} and legal injustice as seen <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> war, censored speech, and nuclear brinksmanship.

Tom King wrote {{that for the first}} time the lyrics dealt with political and environmental issues. He named contemporaries Nuclear Assault as the only other band who applied ecological lyrics to thrash metal songs rather than singing about Satan and Egyptian plagues. McIver noted that Hetfield, the band's main lyricist, wrote about topics that he had not addressed before, such as his revolt against the establishment.
