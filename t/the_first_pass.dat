5|$|In late February 1944, Scherf {{took part}} in a sortie over Axis {{occupied}} territory with Squadron Leader Howie Clevelend; Scherf flew the leading aircraft of the two. The pair attacked an Axis airfield at St Yan, France, and successfully destroyed three aircraft on the ground. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a Heinkel He 111Z twin-fuselage glider tug towing two Gotha Go 242 gliders. Scherf and Clevelend attacked the party, with Clevelend firing first and destroying one of the gliders. Scherf then destroyed the second glider, before the pair assaulted the Heinkel. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pass,</b> Scherf set the starboard engine ablaze while Clevelend hit the starboard side. Scherf made a second firing pass, before the Heinkel spiralled to the ground with three of its five engines on fire. This action was Scherf's final sortie of his tour. The pair were credited with shooting down three aircraft in this operation, with an additional three others damaged or destroyed on the ground.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>pass</b> {{through the}} {{hepatic portal vein}} results {{in some of the}} drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active {{metabolite}} of dextromethorphan called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.|$|E
25|$|A Gaussian blur {{effect is}} {{typically}} generated by convolving an image with a kernel of Gaussian values.

In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction.

25|$|Oral {{testosterone}} {{is provided}} exclusively as testosterone undecanoate. It {{is available in}} Europe and Canada, {{but not in the}} United States. Once absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, testosterone is shunted (at very high blood levels) to the liver where it can cause liver damage (albeit very rarely) and worsens some of the adverse effects of testosterone, like lower HDL (good) cholesterol. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>pass</b> metabolism of the liver also may result in testosterone levels too low to provide satisfactory masculinization and suppress menses. Because of the short terminal half-life of testosterone, oral testosterone undecanoate must be administered two to four times per day, preferably with food (which improves its absorption).|$|E
