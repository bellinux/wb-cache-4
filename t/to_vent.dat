5|$|Life Is Good is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American rapper Nas. It was recorded at various studios in New York and California, and produced primarily by No I.D. and Salaam Remi. Nas wrote the album after his divorce from recording artist Kelis and {{compared it to}} Marvin Gaye's 1978 record Here, My Dear. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> personal feelings and address moments in his life in his songs, while drawing on 1980s hip hop influences for the album's production in order to complement its nostalgic tone.|$|E
5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} hydrothermal vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407°C were recorded {{at one of these}} vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464°C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February, MNS workers {{attacked}} {{vendors and}} shopkeepers from North India {{in various parts}} of Maharashtra and destroyed government property <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> their anger against the reported move to arrest Raj. Sporadic violence was reported in Beed and Aurangabad. State-run buses in these areas were stone-pelted, resulting in the arrest of several MNS workers. In Nashik, MNS workers vandalised several shops belonging to North Indians, forcing other shops and business establishments to close down. One shopkeeper was severely beaten and was admitted to Nashik General Hospital. Banks and schools promptly closed after these incidents. Stone pelting by angry mobs was also reported from the city's Shalimar and Bytco squares, and the Satpur and Ambad industrial areas remained closed. Nashik police detained 26MNS workers after the violence. Six municipal cooperators were also put under preventive arrest. Additional police pickets were deployed {{in various parts of}} the city, including Shalimar and Ambad Chowk, Satpur, Nashik Road, the MNS head office at Mumbai Naka and some of the city suburbs. In Pune, MNS workers pelted stones on state-run buses and attacked a few shop owners in Pune's Laxmi Road area, prompting shops to shut down to avoid similar attacks.|$|E

5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now anemic and {{not knowing what to}} feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is run over by a train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, {{the islands}} of Colaba and Little Colaba were {{connected}} to Bombay by the Colaba Causeway. In the same year, monthly communication was established between Bombay and London. The Bank of Bombay, the oldest bank in the city, was established in 1840, and the Bank of Western India in 1842. The Cotton Exchange was established in Cotton Green in 1844. Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy funded {{the construction of the}} Mahim Causeway, to connect Mahim to Bandra and the work was completed in 1845. The Commercial Bank of India, established in 1845, issued exotic notes with an interblend of Western and Eastern Motifs. On 3 November 1845, the Grant Medical College and hospital, the third in the country, was founded by Governor Robert Grant. The earliest riots occurred at Mahim in 1850, in consequence of a dispute between two rival factions of Khojas. Riots broke out between Muslims and Parsis in October 1851, in consequence of an ill-advised article on Prophet Muhammad which appeared in the Chitra Gnyan Darpan newspaper. The first political organization of the Bombay Presidency, the Bombay Association, was started on 26 August 1852, <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> public grievances to the British. The first-ever Indian railway line began operations between Bombay and neighbouring Thane over a distance of 21 miles on 16 April 1853. The Bombay Spinning and Weaving Company was the first cotton mill to be established in the city on 7 July 1854 at Tardeo in Central Bombay. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB) was incorporated in 1855.|$|E

25|$|Now, twenty-two {{days have}} passed since Jesus allowed the devils <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> their anger on me.

40|$|A {{parachute}} {{having an}} improved vent line stacking wherein the parachute {{is provided with}} a canopy having a central vent opening and a <b>vent</b> band secured <b>to</b> the canopy around {{the periphery of the}} vent opening, with a plurality of vent lines each lying on a diameter of the vent opening and having its ends secured <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band {{on opposite sides of the}} vent opening is described. The vent lines are sewed <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band in an order such that the end of a first vent line is sewed <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band at a starting point with the end of a second vent band then being sewed <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band adjacent <b>to</b> and counterclockwise from the first band. A third vent band is sewed <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band adjacent <b>to</b> and clockwise from the first band, with a fourth vent band being sewed <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band adjacent <b>to</b> and counterclockwise from the second vent band. It can be seen that, if the vent lines are numbered in the order of being sewed <b>to</b> the <b>vent</b> band, the odd numbered vent lines will run consecutively in a clockwise direction and the even numbered lines will run consecutively in a counterclockwise direction from the starting point. With this order of assembly, each and every vent line will be separated from adjacent vent lines by no more than one vent line in the center of the vent opening where the vent lines cross...|$|R

25|$|The old {{endemics}} {{have undergone}} an adaptive radiation, which produced such distinctive forms as the small, shrew-like Pseudohydromys, the amphibious Hydromys, tree mice {{of the genus}} Chiruromys, and several genera of giant rats, of which Mallomys is the largest. This genus contains the largest rat found in New Guinea, the grey black-eared giant rat (Mallomys aroaensis); males can reach a length of 41 centimetres (16.1in) from snout <b>to</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Helmets {{also have}} a {{spring-loaded}} exhaust valve which allows excess air to leave the helmet. The spring force is adjustable by the diver to prevent the suit from deflating completely or over-inflating and the diver being floated uncontrollably to the surface. Some helmets have an extra manual exhaust valve known as a spit-cock. This allows the diver <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> excess air when {{he is in a}} position where the main exhaust can not function correctly.|$|E

25|$|Skylab was {{the only}} launch not {{directly}} related to the Apollo lunar landing program. The only significant changes to the Saturn V from the Apollo configurations involved some modification to the S-II to act as the terminal stage for inserting the Skylab payload into Earth orbit, and <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> excess propellant after engine cutoff so the spent stage would not rupture in orbit. The S-II remained in orbit for almost two years, and made an uncontrolled re-entry on January 11, 1975.|$|E
25|$|The native mammal fauna of New Guinea lacks large predators. The {{carnivorous}} marsupials, Dasyuromorphia, of New Guinea are all {{small in}} comparison to Australian species, and most are insectivorous. The largest is the bronze quoll (Dasyurus spartacus), a rare quoll, first discovered in southern New Guinea in 1979. It reaches a snout <b>to</b> <b>vent</b> length of 36 centimetres (14.2in). Fossils of larger marsupials have been found, including the carnivorous thylacine (Thylacinus sp.), however evidence of carnivorous megafauna, such as the marsupial lion (Thylacoleo), has not been found.|$|E

One crew member lost consciousness during descent. Upon landing, the crew was hospitalized for 14 days for chemical-induced pneumonia and edema.|$|E
