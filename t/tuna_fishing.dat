5|$|Numerous {{investigations}} of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television {{programs such as}} Flipper. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> and by getting caught in crab traps.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of bromelyn enzyme from pineapple waste on the quality of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> waste.  The information generated from this research used to increase the utilization of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> waste for poultry feedstuff. This research was conducted experimentally using Completely Randomized Design (CRD) and Least Significant Difference (LSD).  The treatments were P 1 (head of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple steak); P 2 (head of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple peel); P 3 (head of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple middle); P 4 (digestive tracts of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple steak); P 5 (digestive tracts of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple peel); P 6 (digestive tracts of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> + 12. 5 % bromelyn from pineapple middle). These treatments were replicated three times.   The results showed that true protein content of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> waste was affected by bromelyn treatments.   The average of true protein content was 12. 06; 14. 80; 19. 74; 17. 32; 17. 34; and 16. 61 mg/g, for P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5, and P 6 respectively.   The results showed true protein was highly significant (P< 0. 01).  The true protein content of <b>tuna</b> <b>fish</b> waste head added with bromelyn from pineapple middle was highest compare to the other treatments.  Amino acids were twelve the all treatments tested.

25|$|According to Janes {{the navy}} is badly underfunded {{and much of}} its {{equipment}} {{is in need of}} maintenance; as a consequence it is scarcely able to carry out its tasks, with operations often delayed or cancelled. The navy's patrol craft are barely effective; fuel costs and maintenance problems mean that often only one boat is available for sea duty at any time, while the heavy landing craft have high upkeep costs and are nearing the end of their service life. Although the patrol boats may be at times serviceable, the task of patrolling such a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is too great and they are heavily reliant for information about the presence of foreign ships on daily reports supplied by US satellite surveillance. The main concern is illegal <b>tuna</b> <b>fishing</b> by Japanese vessels. The navy would like larger vessels as the Pacific class experiences difficulties in deep ocean conditions and is exploring the possibility of procuring a 2,000 tonne multipurpose vessel, or the conversion of a merchant vessel, for patrol duties.|$|E

A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from Japan, and later from the Portuguese Azores and Italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like Little Italy and Point Loma. Due to rising costs and foreign competition, the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s.|$|E

Silky sharks and bottlenose dolphins compete when both species target the same school of fish; the amount eaten by the dolphins decreases relative {{to the number of}} sharks present.
