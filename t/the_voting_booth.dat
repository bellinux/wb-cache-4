25|$|The years 1880 and 1881 saw a new {{influx of}} {{political}} refugees from Germany, {{activists in the}} socialist movement fleeing the crackdown on radicalism launched with the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878. This influx of new German members, coming {{during a time of}} low ebb of the English-speaking membership, extended Germanic influence in the SLP. Excluded from <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> by their lack of citizenship status, many of the newcomers had little use for electoral politics. An SLP German militia sued on Second Amendment grounds {{to keep and bear arms}} in Chicago parades. The Supreme Court ruled against them in Presser v. Illinois, however.|$|E
25|$|SNL {{has also}} {{had an effect on}} American {{elections}} – most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth.</b> The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.|$|E

However, the voting machine is rigged to turn his vote into one for Republican candidate John McCain. After six attempts to vote, Homer heads out to report the mishap, but the machine sucks him in and kills him to hide the truth, then shoots his body out of <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth.</b> Jasper sticks a patriotic-themed [...] "I voted" [...] sticker on Homer's forehead.|$|E

25|$|Several {{days before}} Bolivians went to <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. ambassador, Manuel Rocha, warned the Bolivian {{electorate}} that, if they <b>voted</b> for Morales, <b>the</b> US would cut off foreign aid and close its markets to the country. Morales nonetheless received nearly 21% of <b>the</b> <b>vote,</b> putting him {{only a couple}} points behind Sánchez de Lozada.|$|R
500|$|Thomas {{called the}} scene in which Keith makes Veronica dinner [...] "quintessential Keith" [...] and {{indicative}} of his lasting commitment to his daughter. Despite knowing that the episode could be the series finale, Thomas did not want it to completely resolve all plot lines; his intention was to keep viewers guessing and prevent the conclusion from being too bland or typical. He ultimately felt that the final shot of Veronica walking away from <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> in the rain was [...] "a pretty melancholy way to go out". The song [...] "It Never Rains in Southern California" [...] by Albert Hammond plays during the final scene. In promotional advertising for the episode, The CW billed it as a season finale, {{despite the fact that}} the series had already been cancelled.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, a Books-by-Rail branch {{was opened}} at the Hillsboro Central MAX Light Rail station [...] in a [...] space. [...] Two times in 2002 and again in 2004, the city had {{property}} tax levies on the ballot {{to build a new}} $25 million library. Plans called for building a [...] building on Cornell Road at 206th in the Tanasbourne area to replace the Tanasbourne branch. The levies to build the new library and remodel the Shute Park location failed. The first measure in 2002 received majority support at <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth,</b> but lost due to low voter turnout and the state’s double-majority law.|$|E
50|$|Random {{numbers are}} used to record <b>votes.</b> Central to <b>the</b> scheme {{is the use of}} trusted random number {{generating}} devices in <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> alongside <b>the</b> electronic <b>voting</b> machines. Also crucial are its paper receipts which, while not revealing how a vote was cast, and so inhibiting vote buying and intimidation, still allow voters to check that their vote was correctly counted.|$|R
50|$|It is {{election}} day in Springfield and Homer {{is on his}} way to <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> at Springfield Elementary School, all the while showing his bitterness about <b>voting.</b> Arriving at <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths,</b> Homer is initially unable to decide whether he should vote for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, as both have their flaws. Eventually, Homer votes for Romney, but is shocked to find that he got a medical deduction for a personality implant, he has six wives all named Ann, and the government paid him taxes for five years. Before Homer can rush out of the booth to tell the press, he is sucked into a tube and gets outsourced to a factory somewhere in China, where US flags are being made. Homer is initially satisfied with the outcome because he has got a steady job until Selma comes out of the tube.|$|R

2500|$|Wade {{was killed}} in a car {{accident}} when strong winds swept his Jeep off a North Carolina highway in 1996. Three weeks before his death, Wade was honored by First Lady Hillary Clinton at The White House as one of the 10 finalists in an essay contest sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Voice of America for an essay he wrote on entering <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> with his father. [...] Wade, accompanied by his parents and sister, went on to meet North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, who later entered Wade's essay and his obituary into the Congressional Record. Edwards and his wife began the Wade Edwards Foundation in their son's memory; the purpose of the non-profit organization is [...] "to reward, encourage, and inspire young people in the pursuit of excellence." [...] The Foundation funded the Wade Edwards Learning Lab at Wade's high school, Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh, along with scholarship competitions and essay awards.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, Barlow {{was unable to}} {{reconcile}} his ardent libertarianism with the prevailing neoconservative movement, and [...] "didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush"; in 2004, {{he said that he}} was [...] "voting for John Kerry, though with little enthusiasm". Barlow has subsequently declared that he is a Republican, most notably during an appearance on The Colbert Report on March 26, 2007, and has also claimed on many occasions to be an anarchist. Barlow has said he voted for Natural Law Party Presidential candidate John Hagelin in 2000 after discovering in <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> that his friend Nat Goldhaber was Hagelin's running mate. He said in 2004: [...] "I'm embarrassed for my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom I felt I could vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for George Wallace, Dick Gregory, or John Hagelin, have been protest votes." [...] Barlow condemned Donald Trump in November 2016, characterizing him as a [...] "thorough creep" [...] and [...] "toxic asshole" [...] in a Facebook [...] "micromanifesto".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{condemnation}} from media outlets— in 1965, when reporter Theodore H. White published The Making of the President, 1964, {{he referred}} to Wallace as a [...] "narrow-minded, grotesquely provincial man"— Wallace's opposition to the Civil Rights Act, which he based upon states' rights, represented what pundits and analysts began referring to as backlash, specifically white backlash. Coined in summer 1963 {{to refer to the}} possibility that white workers, when forced to compete with their black colleagues in a shrinking job market, might [...] "lash back", backlash came to be associated with whites' ability to do so in <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> in the face of racial tension, as they had done with the repeal of the Rumford Fair Housing Act in California. A series of riots over civil rights in cities throughout the U.S., notably in Cambridge, Maryland, and the Black Power movement further heightened the tension on which Wallace was able to capitalize. Wallace's connection with the alienated workingman would later manifest itself in the concept of the so-called [...] "silent majority".|$|E
50|$|Several {{days before}} Bolivians went to <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. {{ambassador}} Manuel Rocha warned the Bolivian electorate {{that if they}} voted for a candidate known to have links with drug-trafficking, referring indirectly to Morales, the US would cut off foreign aid and close its markets to the country. Because of the public outrage this statement generated, Morales received nearly 21% of <b>the</b> <b>vote,</b> putting him only a couple points behind Sánchez de Lozada.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{a memorable}} day. In spite of Mr. Lawler's Pilot, {{which was as}} a voice crying in the wilderness, {{citizens}} who had wives and homes and responsibilities, business men and clerks went to <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> and recorded their choice for Trulease, Watling and Prosperity: and working-men followed suit. Victory was in the air. Even the policemen wore happy smiles, {{and in some instances}} the election officers themselves in absent-minded exuberance thrust bunches of ballots into the boxes! ...|$|R
50|$|Because of time zones, {{election}} results are broadcast {{in the eastern}} parts of the United States while polls are still open in the west. This difference has led to research on how the behavior of voters in western United States is influenced by news about the decisions of voters in other time zones. In 1980, NBC News declared Ronald Reagan to be {{the winner of the}} presidential race {{on the basis of the}} exit polls several hours before <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> closed in <b>the</b> west.|$|R
5000|$|A {{voting booth}} or polling booth (in British English) is a room or cabin in a polling station where voters {{are able to}} cast their vote in private to protect the secrecy of the ballot. [...] Commonly the {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> is a retractable curtain. Usually access to <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> is restricted to a single person, with exceptions for voters requiring assistance.|$|E

50|$|The {{elections}} were finally declared invalid by Thailand's Constitutional Court, {{which found that}} the positioning of <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> violated voter privacy. The Constitutional Court later pressured the Election Commission to resign for its management of the April elections. The Court was unsuccessful in pressuring the EC head to resign; however, it did prevent the Senate from appointing a replacement for commissioner Jaral Buranapansri who had died. This prevented the EC from having a quorum. It later found the remaining Commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} in office, he, {{along with his}} {{colleague}} Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus, opposed {{the passage of a}} law proposed by Gaius Marius, then a Plebeian tribune, which was meant to reform the configuration of <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths,</b> thereby reducing <b>the</b> influence of the so-called Optimates. He asked the Senate to order Marius to present himself before them; when they did so, Marius responded by threatening to have Cotta imprisoned. After Cotta’s colleague Metellus was imprisoned on Marius’ orders, Cotta and the Senate backed down and allowed the passage of Marius’ law.|$|R
2500|$|Red {{was accused}} of electoral fraud in late September, after a member had {{replaced}} Conservative Party tickets with Red tickets in <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> at Bønes Skole in Bergen. Trond R. Hole, a Conservative Party official, said he was [...] "shocked", but assumed it was an individual and not the party that had committed the fraud. Dahle told the media that he, and the party, were strongly opposed to such a heinous crime. Later, the Conservative Party accused Red of another election fraud, this time in Oslo, but this time they had no proof to back up their claims.|$|R
50|$|The secrecy of the vote, {{the fact}} that the printed receipt does not reveal how a vote was cast, depends on the numbers {{generated}} in <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> being sufficiently random that they cannot be identified.|$|E

50|$|Devoting himself {{mostly to}} teaching, Gorostiza {{produced}} only two new {{plays in the}} next decade. A novel published early in 1976 (Los cuartos oscuros - <b>The</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths)</b> yielded him a National Grand Prize for Literature. This, his first novel, coincided with the military coup that would usher in the most brutal Argentine dictatorship of the 20th century; shortly thereafter, Gorostiza lost his tenure at the University of Buenos Aires. Cautious but undeterred, Gorostiza published a second novel, Los hermanos queridos (Dear brothers), in 1978. A subtle criticism of the era's climate of fear, it earned him another Municipal Grand Prize and National Grand Prize.|$|R

The service was attended by thousands of people, including 2,500 filling the sanctuary, and others in an overflow auditorium which was also full. An estimated 2,000 additional people were on church property for the funeral. Eric Davis, one of Brown's cousins, said at the funeral, [...] "how up at <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths.</b> Let your voices be heard, and let everyone know that we have had enough of all of this." ...|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the already heated political mood, the planned local elections of May 1989 took on greater significance than usual. GDR citizens had long become accustomed to casting their vote by simply folding their ballot paper containing the confirmed candidate list and placing it in the ballot box without even using <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths.</b> However, after falsified electoral results at some polling stations in 1986 had been noted by oppositional observers, such controls were now supposed to be systematically carried out in all regions. Since the previous summer, different groups - mostly religious in nature - had called on Christians in the GDR to actively intervene in the preparation of the election on 7 May 1989.|$|R

50|$|While historians concur that <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> were {{accurately}} counted, {{the process}} was neither free nor secret. Officials were present directly beside <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> and received <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> ballot by hand (in contrast to a secret <b>vote</b> where <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> ballot is inserted into a closed box). In some remote areas of Austria, people <b>voted</b> to preserve <b>the</b> independence of Austria on 13 March (in Schuschnigg's planned but cancelled plebiscite) despite the Wehrmachts presence. For instance, {{in the village of}} Innervillgraten, a majority of 95% voted for Austria's independence. However, in the plebiscite on 10 April, 73.3% of votes in Innervillgraten were in favor of the Anschluss, which was still the lowest number of all Austrian municipalities. Although {{there is no doubt that}} the plebiscite result was manipulated and rigged, there was unquestionably a lot of genuine support for Hitler for carrying out the Anschluss.|$|R
2500|$|In 1919, Judge Perez {{launched}} a reign of bought elections and strictly enforced segregation. Laws were enacted on Perez's fiat and were rubber-stamped by the parish governing councils. Elections under Perez's reign were sometimes blatantly falsified, with voting records appearing {{in alphabetical order}} and names of national celebrities such as Babe Ruth, Charlie Chaplin, and Herbert Hoover appearing on the rolls. Perez-endorsed candidates often won with 90% {{or more of the}} ballots. Those who appeared to vote were intimidated by Perez's enforcers.
