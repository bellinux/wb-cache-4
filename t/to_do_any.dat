5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1976, though an Associated Press report in August 1975 had suggested filming would start in late 1975. Spielberg {{did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> location shooting because of his negative experience on Jaws and wanted to shoot Close Encounters entirely on sound stages, but eventually dropped the idea.|$|E
5|$|The quick {{responses}} {{took the}} blue chief by surprise; defeated and unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> {{damage to the}} vessel, the blue men returned to their underwater caves, allowing the vessel free passage through the strait. The blue men may alternatively board a passing vessel and demand tribute from its crew, threatening that {{if it is not}} forthcoming they will raise up a storm.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E

50|$|The FOSS program uses several {{instructional}} pedagogies: inquiry-based learning (each {{investigation is}} guided by questions), hands-on learning and active investigation (students work with materials and conduct investigations to attempt to answer questions), student-to-student interaction, writing (students keep careful notes in science notebooks), and research/reading (readings are included to enhance or underscore active investigation—students work with materials prior <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>any</b> reading).|$|R
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E
5|$|The {{scheme of}} {{manoeuvre}} adopted by 1 RAR dictated that each company undertake a dispersed patrol program {{in their own}} tactical area of responsibility, a fact which {{would allow them to}} search more ground, but limit their ability to concentrate combat power in the event of contact. A Company, under Major John Healy, patrolled east; B Company moved north along the Song Be to Xom Xoai, while D Company patrolled south. C Company remained at LZ Queen to protect 105 Field Battery which had established a fire support base (FSB). Over the next two days the Australians patrolled relentlessly through the leech-infested swamps and dense jungle. At midday on 6 November A Company received two mortar rounds which failed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> damage, but marked the start of a series of minor clashes. A Company had a number of contacts during this time, with the Australians killing a Viet Cong scout for the loss of two wounded in one skirmish. A further contact soon after resulted in two more Viet Cong killed and one wounded. Intelligence gained from these incidents indicated the presence of a Viet Cong Main Force Regiment in the area, while documents recovered contained plans for attacks on ARVN outposts near Bien Hoa Airbase.|$|E

25|$|However, the Cultural Revolution came. From 1966-1976, {{billions of}} people in China {{suffered}} from it. All educators and scientists were suppressed. Lanying Lin was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> research and {{had to stay in}} her room under the monitoring of others. Lanying Lin’s father, a great educator, died when he was assaulted by many young people.|$|E

25|$|A {{new feature}} of Incapacity Benefit was that {{officials}} {{could ask for}} claimants' disabilities to be confirmed using a bespoke testing procedure – the All Work Test – carried out by doctors working for the government. Another feature was that claimants would be assessed on their ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> job, not just their old trade. And unlike its predecessor, Incapacity Benefit was taxable. Nevertheless, the caseload continued to rise.|$|E
25|$|A Freedom of Information request in 2005 {{revealed}} that Eton had received £2,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy. Asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive farming subsidies, Eton admitted {{that it was}} 'a bit of a mystery'. Panorama revealed in March 2012 that farming subsidies were granted to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> farming at all'.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Li {{revealed}} that he suffers from hyperthyroidism and has been dealing with the issue {{for the past three}} years. Since his heart rate can hit 130~140 at normal, Li takes medication to control his heart rate and has been advised not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> sort of exercise. In 2016, he stated that he had recovered from his illness and that accepting fewer film offers was due to his charity work and not because of his health conditions.|$|E

25|$|Miramax favored Holly Hunter or Meg Ryan for {{the role}} of Mia. Alfre Woodard and Meg Tilly were also considered, but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting. She {{dominated}} the film's promotional material, appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite being launched into the celebrity A-list, Thurman chose not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> big-budget films for the following three years. Thurman later starred in Tarantino's two Kill Bill movies (2003, 2004).|$|E
25|$|Christopher Lambert did {{not wish}} to do television, though he agreed {{that there should be a}} series, and {{originally}} Connor MacLeod was to be the protagonist. After Lambert declined, and because there were still films being made with the Connor character, it was decided at Adrian Paul's request to have the series focus on another MacLeod. Lambert agreed to appear in the pilot and pass the torch. They were only able to afford him for three days of filming. Lambert declined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> future episodes.|$|E
25|$|The time won't be {{that bad}} because {{individual}} records are grouped {{together in a}} disk block. A disk block might be 16 kilobytes. If each record is 160 bytes, then 100 records could be stored in each block. The disk read time above was actually for an entire block. Once the disk head is in position, one or more disk blocks can be read with little delay. With 100 records per block, the last 6 or so comparisons don't need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> disk reads—the comparisons are all within the last disk block read.|$|E

25|$|One recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} suicide bombs carried by children. Unlike most suicide bombings, the use of these not only earned condemnation from the United States and from human rights groups such as Amnesty International, but also from many Palestinians and much of the Middle East press. The youngest Palestinian suicide bomber was 16-year-old Issa Bdeir, a high school student from the village of Al Doha, who shocked his friends and family when he blew himself up in a park in Rishon LeZion, killing a teenage boy and an elderly man. The youngest attempted suicide bombing was by a 14-year-old captured by soldiers at the Huwwara checkpoint before managing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>any</b> harm.|$|E
