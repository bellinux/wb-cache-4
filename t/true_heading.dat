50|$|Lawrence Sperry (the son {{of famous}} {{inventor}} Elmer Sperry) demonstrated it in 1914 at an aviation safety contest held in Paris. At the contest, Sperry demonstrated {{the credibility of}} the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers of the contest. Elmer Sperry Jr., the son of Lawrence Sperry, and Capt Shiras continued work after the war on the same autopilot, and in 1930 they tested a more compact and reliable autopilot which kept a US Army Air Corps aircraft on a <b>true</b> <b>heading</b> and altitude for three hours.|$|E
5000|$|If the <b>true</b> <b>heading</b> {{is set at}} the lubber's line, true {{bearings}} {{are observed}} directly. Similarly, compass bearings can be observed if the compass heading is set at the lubber's line, etc. However, the vessel must be on the heading to which the pelorus is set if accurate results are to be obtained, or else a correction must {{be applied to the}} observed results. Perhaps the easiest way of avoiding error is to have the steersman indicate when the vessel is on course. This is usually done by calling out [...] "mark, mark, mark" [...] as long as the vessel is within a specified fraction of a degree of the desired heading. The observer, who is watching a distant object across the pelorus, selects an instant when the vessel is steady and is on course. An alternative method is to have the observer call out [...] "mark" [...] when the relative bearing is steady, and the steersman note the heading. If the compass is swinging at the moment of observation, the observation should be rejected. The number of degrees between the desired and actual headings is added if the vessel is {{to the right of the}} course, and subtracted if to the left. Thus, if the course is 060° and the heading is 062° at the moment of observation, a correction of 2° is added to the bearing.|$|E
40|$|Background: Proprioceptive {{imprecision}} {{is believed}} to contribute to persistent pain. Detecting imprecision in order to study or treat it remains challenging given the limitations of current tests. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether proprioceptive imprecision could be detected in people with neck pain by testing their ability to identify incongruence between <b>true</b> <b>head</b> motion and a false visual reference using the Proprioception Incongruence Detection (PID) Test. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Methods: Twenty-four people with neck pain and 24 matched controls repeatedly rotated to specific markers within a virtual world and indicated if their <b>true</b> <b>head</b> rotation was more or less than the rotation suggested by the visual feedback. Visual feedback was manipulated at 6 corrections, ranging from 60 % of true movement to 140 % of true movement. A standard repositioning error (RPE) test as undertaken for comparison. Results: Healthy controls were better able to detect incongruence between vision and <b>true</b> <b>head</b> rotation (X̅= 75. 6 %, SD= 8. 5 %) than people with neck pain were (X̅= 69. 6 %, SD= 12. 7 %). The RPE test scores were not different between groups. The PID Test score related to self-reported pain intensity but did not relate to RPE test score. Limitations: Causality cannot be established from this cross-sectional study, and further work refining the PID Test is needed for it to offer clinical utility. Conclusions: Proprioceptive precision for neck movement appears worse in people with neck pain than in those without neck pain, and the extent of the deficit appears to be related to usual pain severity. The PID Test appears to be a more sensitive test than the RPE test and is likely to be useful for assessment of proprioceptive function in research and clinical settings. Daniel S.

50|$|User {{selected}} Targets are initially highlighted with a {{small box}} whilst MARPA resolves the relative motion by comparing the relative motion of the target on the screen with the true, actual motion (speed) of the tracking vessel. Once resolved the acquiring box will become either a Circle for safe targets or a triangle for dangerous targets. MARPA can indicate further information with 2 very different but similar looking vectors: True Vectors and Relative Vectors. <b>True</b> <b>heading</b> and speed of a target can be ascertained with a True Vector, {{the length of the}} line indicates the distance the target will actually cover per duration of vector, usually 6 or 3 minutes (this is user selectable) although, range permitting, the 6 minute vectors provide quicker mental calculation of speed. E.g. True 6min vector (TV6) of 0.75 NM indicates the target's true speed is 7.5 Knots, the direction of this vector indicates the vessels heading relative to the tracking vessel or its electronically fed heading if one exists. The relative motion of a target can be seen with Relative vectors, these just show the future position of the target on the Radar screen as per Vector Duration, again usually 6 or 3 minutes depending on range in use. A relative vector of 6 minutes (RV6) would be a line representing the movement of the target for the next 6 minutes. Most colour Radar displays can show both TV and RV simultaneously. It is essential that users of MARPA do not get confused between RV and TV, especially on Radars that can not display both TV and RV. True vectors allow users to, at a glance, determine the aspect of a target, something that is virtually impossible to do without manually plotting, Relative vectors provide users with, at a glance, information about which vessels pose a collision risk, a RV pointing at the centre of the Radar screen indicates there is a risk of collision. All the information pertaining to a target is also available numerically however when tracking multiple targets this information distracts the user from the image, with proper training, viewing vectors is much safer.|$|E
