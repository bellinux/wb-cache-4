500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people <b>think,</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Not a soul made a {{memorandum}} of these sayings of mine, for publication. I saw that, {{and did it}} myself, else {{they would have been}} utterly lost. So far from meeting with a generous encouragement like other children when developing intellectually, I was now furiously scowled upon by my father; my mother looked grieved and anxious, and even my aunt had about her an expression of seeming to <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> had gone too far. I took a vicious bite out of an India-rubber ring, and covertly broke the rattle over the kitten's head, but said nothing. Presently my father said: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Fancy digs aren't my {{priority}} when I travel," [...] wrote Phil Marty of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "but {{then you}} walk into something like Room 302 and <b>think,</b> 'Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should {{spend more time in}} my room.'" [...] He praised the staff's helpfulness in finding another place to valet-park his car with two bicycles on top, and the two half-liter water bottles and Toblerone candy bars on the desk when he came in. He had a few minor complaints: at the time (2007) the hotel did not have free Wi-Fi, the room's light switch could not function as a dimmer, and the hotel would stock the mini-bar only on a guest's request.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song kind of go where it wants to go. I don't think that's a new idea, at all, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> do it to an extreme." [...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances. [...] "Lucette Stranded on the Island" [...] was influenced by Colette's novella, Chance Acquaintances, while novelist Christopher Isherwood's recurring fictional character, Sally Bowles, was an influence in writing [...] "How Long?".|$|R

6000|$|I said, [...] "I'll {{have to get}} you {{to excuse}} me; I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> might write to suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some {{practice}} and learned the language I am confident I could.

But, to speak the plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption. You see that yourself. Vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the public, no doubt, but then I do not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth. I can't write with comfort when I am interrupted so much as I have been to-day. I like this berth well enough, but I don't like to be left here to wait on the customers. The experiences are novel, I grant you, and entertaining, too, after a fashion, but they are not judiciously distributed. A gentleman shoots at you through the window and cripples me; a bomb-shell comes down the stove-pipe for your gratification and sends the stove-door down my throat; a friend drops in to swap compliments with you, and freckles me with bullet-holes till my skin won't hold my principles; you go to dinner, and Jones comes with his cowhide, Gillespie throws me out of the window, Thompson tears all my clothes off, and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom of an old acquaintance; and in less than five minutes all the blackguards in the country arrive in their war-paint, and proceed to scare the rest of me to death with their tomahawks. Take it altogether, I never had such a spirited time in all my life as I have had to-day. No; I like you, and I like your calm, unruffled way of explaining things to the customers, but you see I am not used to it. The Southern heart is too impulsive; Southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger. The paragraphs which I have written to-day, and into whose cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of Tennessean journalism, will wake up another nest of hornets. All that mob of editors will come--and they will come hungry, too, and want somebody for breakfast. I shall have to bid you adieu. I decline to be present at these festivities. I came South for my health; I will go back on the same errand, and suddenly. Tennessean journalism is too stirring for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In fall 2008, Starr {{appeared}} in Fox Reality's Gimme My Reality Show, {{in which she}} competed with such D-listers as Kato Kaelin and A.J. Benza {{for the chance to}} star in her own reality show. Shocked at being cut after the second round, a tearful Starr told the camera, [...] "I sometimes regret doing American Idol because sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> that's why <b>I</b> don't have a record deal... But I promised myself I'd never do anything else I regretted that much. I regret doing this show, and it's going to stay with me for a long time. I regret doing this show." ...|$|R
5000|$|By March 13, 2013, Browder's {{case was}} {{reviewed}} by a Brooklyn judge, Patricia M. DiMango, {{brought into the}} Bronx for the backlogged cases. She offered him another plea deal of admission of guilt to two misdemeanors {{and the ability to}} go home immediately, as the 16 months for those misdemeanors would have already been served by Browder's time in prison. He refused this plea deal as well:DiMango: [...] "I could sentence you today[...] [...] [...] It's up to you."Browder: [...] "I'm all right. I did not do it. I'm all right."DiMango: [...] "You are all right?" [...] Browder: [...] "Yes, I want to go to trial."Thus, he returned to Rikers, where his fellow inmates proclaimed that Browder was [...] "bugging" [...] and [...] "stupid" [...] for not taking the tempting plea deal. However, he remained determined as ever to prove his innocence. He was quoted saying, [...] ""I used to go to my cell and lie down and <b>think,</b> like, <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> am crazy; <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am going too far. But I just did what I thought was right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} it isn't and never has been. A woman's life is her husband's and her children's, and that's why--but it is no use arguing. You have taken your own line. Perhaps you are right, God knows. At any rate, it isn't mine, so we had better part. Still, I rather admire your courage. I wonder what this young fellow is like for whose sake you are {{prepared}} to lose so much; more than you <b>think,</b> <b>maybe,</b> for <b>I</b> had grown fond of you. Well, good-bye, I'll see about your getting off. There, don't think that I bear malice although I am so angry with you.

[...] "I think he seems so adorable. I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was his mom in a past life or something."

"Yeah, I {{was able}} to manage them quite well but {{something}} I {{want to say is}} that yesterday was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> can speak for all of us drivers, quite a sad day to see Felipe not with us here today. Hopefully I speak on behalf of all of us when I say we miss him and wish him well and wish him a speedy recovery. But back to the car, it was just fantastic. The team asked me to look after the tyres in which through all the great experiences I have had - good or bad - I {{was able to}} apply that today, so really a big thank you to all the guys and all the fans that have always given me support and never gave me up and to all my family."

We've got 20 to 25 songs written and we're narrowing it down now. John Feldmann is producing it. It's going {{to be more of a}} punk rock record than anything we've done before. It's Social Distortion meets Metallica." [...] Based on this statement, many people were led to believe that the record would literally be a punk rock album, but Biersack clarified his statement in {{an interview}} with Artisan News, stating [...] "The intention was never to make a punk rock record. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that... <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should have chosen my words better when I said that. The intention was to play on our influences a lot more and really go back to basics with how we wrote songs and focusing sic on the more punk rock ethic and the things that we felt early on when we were making our own merchandise; touring in a car with, you know, all of us sitting on top of each other in a U-haul trailer; and, you know, playing in clubs on soap, like, sic little soapboxes and stuff... I didn't wanna make a Stiff Little Fingers record." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>I</b> feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|R
5000|$|Portnoy {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the tracks as “very therapeutic.” Upon finishing the Suite in 2009, however, he reflected that he had “dug himself into a hole with it. It was a nice idea seven years ago. … After a while it became like an obligation hanging over my head, like a homework assignment.” He said that he “didn’t know if he would have done it” had he known how large the Suite would grow: “If I had realized what I was getting myself into five albums ago … I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> would have written one song that encompassed all twelve steps.” ...|$|E
5000|$|It took Koenig {{a decade}} to bring the film to fruition. He {{initially}} wrote the lead role for himself, but reevaluated his view [...] "that the audience would buy me as a romantic interest", and offered it to Battlestar Galactica's Richard Hatch. He also considered playing attorney Ellis: [...] "In retrospect, I {{might have had a}} great deal of fun playing the lawyer — which, I have to admit, Erick Avari so brilliantly played — but I love comedy and I <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could've brought something to it." [...] He chose the role of antagonist Dr. Schilling instead: [...] "I've played heavies before — I had a recurring role on Babylon Five as one — so I'm not unfamiliar with emotional mechanisms and mechanics that go along with it." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{took a good}} gap and a stretch, and {{was just}} going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in {{rowlocks}} when it's a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. <b>Think's</b> <b>I,</b> <b>maybe</b> it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.

40|$|Let’s {{start with}} the obvious: Language is a shared resource. I wrote that five-word phrase—“language is a shared resource”—all by my-self. I swear I did, or I thought I did. But then I did a phrase search in Google and {{discovered}} that the phrase is not original! It was said before, in a 2002 book by Tor Nørretranders called The Generous Man. Well, that’s not quite true—actually, the phrase is the English translation by Jonathan Sydenham of a phrase Nørretranders expressed in Danish. The English phrase also appeared in a 2006 article by J. C. Spender in a business journal, so he must have plagia-rized it from Nørretranders—or, rather, Sydenham. What a trail of deceit; it’s all very dense and confusing. Things get even worse. The more egregious act of plagiarism in paragraph one is actually the phrase “let’s {{start with the}} obvious, ” a journalistic cliché of the first rank. Don’t even bother to Google search that one—it’s ubiquitous in sports and entertainment features, in editorials, in advertising. I thought what I wrote as paragraph one was my own, but clearly it is not. I must have plagiarized it, the entire first two sentences of my paper. The textual evidence is conclusive, incontrovertible, damning. Am I {{to be charged with}} academic dishonesty, along with Steve Westbrook, who admits to stealing a phrase from Raymond Carver for the title of his chapter? Or else [...] .

So I had a D.C. non-profit job, and then I spent 18 months working in the cheese department for Whole Foods Market, and then I again decided I wanted to be a sports writer, so I started taking down high school field hockey scores and making photocopies and talking to deranged callers as a Post newsaide. The truth is, a friend of a friend was in charge of hiring sports newsaides at the time, so I got very lucky with that, and I got very lucky with a few random writing assignments, and a bunch of editors were way nicer to me than they needed to be, etc, until I got a full-time writing job." ...|$|E

After Welch said that Davis and the rest of Korn cared only about money, Davis responded in kind, opening a rift between them that has since been resolved. In an interview in which Welch was asked about his book and Korn's reaction to the book and the attacks in the media he made earlier at the band:They heard that I'd written it, and there was rumors going around in Hollywood that I was totally trashing them and that it was a 'tell all' book about everything they did and I did. And so they actually wrote two songs on their new album bashing me about the book. But once I heard that they were concerned about the book, I sent them a copy and put a note in there and said, 'I love you guys. I didn't trash you like people say. Read it yourselves. It is what it is.' And now they're doing interviews, and I've read that they're totally cool with the book, and it's not what they {{thought it was going to}} be. So everyone's happy.
