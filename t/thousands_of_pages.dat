Almost all of the film's script was drawn from <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of documentation. His first draft became the {{shooting}} script; {{it was his first}} film screenplay to be produced. Ron Howard had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer produced Changeling alongside Malpaso Productions' Robert Lorenz and Eastwood. Universal Pictures financed and distributed the film.|$|E

5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of {{evidence}} gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent {{assigned to the}} case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On {{their way to the}} finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of finite simple groups is regarded {{by some to}} be the longest proof of a theorem.

These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof. Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is certainly the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.|$|E

30|$|Information {{about the}} companies’ NGO {{cooperation}} was retrieved solely from their websites to capture how they present themselves. Company representatives {{could have been}} interviewed, but the information would have reflected the interview subjects’ personal views of the partnership. Alternatively, one could search the Web to learn how the partnership has been covered in the media, but that approach would be too random to represent the cooperation. Material about the company’s NGO collaboration on its own website is the company’s official report. What a company chooses to report on about its NGO relationship is itself documentation and contributes to a more objective way of comparing companies. Still, company websites can be <b>of</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages.</b> It might be that this study does not capture all the information available. However, the cases are mainly used to illustrate how to apply the revised model. Therefore the key information provided is acceptable.|$|R

Since the greater number of Rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian left-wing {{became a}} major {{priority}} for intelligence services in the RCMP during the period between the two world wars, particularity focusing on the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). As {{the likelihood of a}} second world war increased in 1938, some attention shifted to fascist movements in Canada. In these years, at divisions and in the field, the number of persons involved in intelligence work varied enormously. This number did not usually exceed 10 to 20 officers in major cities and most work was done on a part-time basis. Likewise, the full-time Ottawa intelligence staff never exceeded {{more than a handful of}} personnel in the inter-war period. However, the efforts of Ottawa and out-lying divisions produced hundreds of <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of material in the period alone.|$|E
25|$|Into this divided community, {{the mine}} owners hired spies {{to monitor and}} {{undermine}} the union. Spies supplied <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of daily reports on the internal workings of the CCMU; its divisions, its plans, its weaknesses. Although everyone {{knew that there were}} spies in the union (the details of secret union leadership meetings were printed the following day in the Leadville Herald Democrat), they never guessed their identities. Spies were entrusted with union security responsibilities, even with the responsibility of detecting possible spies. The spies faithfully recorded information about ethnic rivalries and philosophical disputes among die-hard and disillusioned unionists, militants and pacifists, optimists and pessimists, and the spy agencies passed that information on to the mine operators. With comprehensive daily reports on secret union meetings and the union's tactical plans, mine owners were able to outwit, outmaneuver, and outlast the strikers.|$|E

50|$|As a {{composer}} of microtonal music Sandberg intended to translate {{and interpret the}} sacred texts of all the worlds’ religions to musical form. He began his monumental project with the Hebrew Bible, from his own European Jewish tradition. He theorized that microtonal music, incorporating the tonal traditions of Asia, was an appropriate means for setting Hebrew, an Oriental language, to music. Over {{the course of his}} life, Sandberg produced some twenty <b>thousand</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> musical composition. His magnum opus was Symphonic Psalms, the setting of the Book of Psalms to music, a task which comprised more than twelve <b>thousand</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> composition.|$|R

500|$|The {{day after}} Trevor-Roper gave {{his opinion of}} authenticity, Rupert Murdoch and his {{negotiation}} team arrived in Zürich. A deal was provisionally agreed for $2.5million for the US serialisation rights, with an additional $750,000 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the discussions between Murdoch and Sorge were taking place, the diaries were examined by Broyle and his Newsweek team. After lengthy negotiation Broyle was informed that the minimum price Stern would consider was $3million; the Americans returned home, informing Hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days. When Broyle contacted the Germans he offered the amount, subject to authentication by their chosen expert, Gerhard Weinberg. In 1952 Weinberg, a cautious and careful historian, had written the Guide to Captured German Documents, {{for use by the}} US military; the work is described by Hamilton as definitive in its scope of the subject. Weinberg travelled to Zürich and, like Trevor-Roper, was impressed and reassured by the range of items on show; he was also partly persuaded by Trevor-Roper's endorsement of the diaries' authenticity. Weinberg commented that [...] "the notion of anyone forging hundreds, even <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> of handwriting was hard to credit".|$|E
500|$|One of Hutchinson's {{instructions}} was {{to relocate}} the provincial assembly from Boston to Cambridge, {{where it would}} be less under the influence of radical Boston politics. [...] This modest demand, accomplished by executive order, resulted in howls of complaint of gubernatorial arbitrariness in the assembly, and an exchange of arguments, rebuttals, and counterarguments between Hutchinson and the assembly that ran for <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> and lasted until 1772. The nature of the affair furthered the radical cause, whose proponents painted Hutchinson's action as a bold and devious attempt to further the executive prerogative. The radicals were further outraged when Hutchinson announced in 1772 that his salary, which had previously been subject to appropriation by the assembly, would be paid by the crown instead. This was seen by the radicals as a further usurpation of power that rightfully belonged in the province. [...] Written debates with the assembly extended to the role of Parliament in governing the policies, and further deepened the divide between it and Hutchinson. They also raised flags elsewhere in the colonies and in England, where observers noted that Hutchinson's arguments had effectively driven moderates in the province to join with the political hardliners.|$|E
