30|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognized that immigrants are potentially both complements and substitutes for each other. In the broader {{sense of the}} term, complementary mechanisms (e.g. job creation, provision of financial resources, and demand for ethnic products) positively assist immigrants to be self-employed; while a substitution mechanism (e.g. as employees competing for jobs, or competition in business) negatively influences immigrants' labour market performance. As a result, immigrants benefit from concentrating geographically by ethnicity once the complementary mechanisms dominate the substitution mechanisms.
