5|$|<b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> Treasury set {{interest}} rates. After {{reforms in}} 1992, officials held regular meetings and published minutes, {{but were not}} independent of government. The result was a feeling that political factors were clouding what should be purely economic judgements on monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is <b>traditionally</b> <b>the</b> function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is <b>traditionally</b> <b>the</b> function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|Further, scrutinizing {{legislation}} {{to determine if}} it contravenes fundamental liberties is <b>traditionally</b> <b>the</b> function of the judiciary.

5|$|Modern historians {{debate whether}} an {{alliance}} between the Franks and Mongols would {{have been successful in}} shifting {{the balance of power in}} the region, and if it would have been a wise choice on the part of the Europeans. <b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> Mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies, with little room in the middle for a concept such as an ally.|$|E
5|$|November is <b>traditionally</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the {{thunderstorm}} season along the eastern seaboard of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with more frequent occurrences of cool air in the upper atmosphere.

Nowadays, the traditional view of kulintang as strictly for women has waned as {{both women and men}} play all five instruments, with some of the more renowned kulintang players being men.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> West of China {{has been}} weaker economically, as it {{promises}} a less lucrative {{return to the}} investors than its eastern competitors. Thus, the China Western Development policy aimed to attract foreign investment. This was {{to be done by}} creating a more stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. The creation of a new economic zone would encourage cooperation between cities, which would lead to greater rates of progress.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> {{absence of}} crystal flaws is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, optical dispersion (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.|$|E

5|$|<b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> {{butterflies}} {{have been}} divided into the superfamily Papilionoidea excluding the smaller {{groups of the}} Hesperiidae (skippers) and the more moth-like Hedylidae of America.
