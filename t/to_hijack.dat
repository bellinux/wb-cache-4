5|$|After the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), {{the navy}} was used <b>to</b> <b>hijack</b> Swedish {{ships in the}} Baltic Sea, and in 1680, six Brandenburg-Prussian vessels {{captured}} the Spanish vessel Carolus Secundus near Oostende to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies. The Spanish ship was renamed Markgraf von Brandenburg ("Margrave of Brandenburg") and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver; it was not successful in this mission. In the following years, the navy was expanded, and the policy of leasing ships {{was replaced by the}} policy of building or purchasing them. On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110,000 talers. Also in 1684, the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg-Prussian naval base. From Pillau, part of the shipyard, the admiral's house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden. While Emden was not part of Brandenburg-Prussia, the elector owned a nearby castle, Greetsiel, and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port.|$|E

5|$|Baccano! is a 2007 anime series {{directed}} by Takahiro Omori and produced by Brain's Base and Aniplex. The 16 episodes are {{adapted from the}} light novels {{of the same name}} written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Katsumi Enami. Told in out-of-order sequences, the story spans three consecutive years of Prohibition-era America during which three seemingly unconnected events occur: two bottles of immortality elixir are passed around Manhattan by gangsters believing it is alcohol, a supposed monster massacres members of two gangs attempting <b>to</b> <b>hijack</b> the transcontinental train Flying Pussyfoot, and a man is tracked down by his sister and a gang. The first thirteen episodes aired in Japan from July 26, 2007 to November 1, 2007 on WOWOW, a Japanese pay-per-view station, and the final three were released direct-to-DVD. The series made its North American television debut when it started airing on the Funimation Channel after the channel transitioned to HD in September 2010.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London <b>to</b> <b>hijack</b> the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle of}} the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E

40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was {{designed}} without security in mind. Until today, this fact makes the Internet vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>hijacking</b> attacks that intercept or blackhole Internet traffic. So far, significant {{effort has been}} put into the detection of IP prefix hijacking, while AS hijacking has received little attention. AS hijacking is more sophisticated than IP prefix hijacking, and is aimed at a long-term benefit such as over a duration of months. In this paper, we study a malicious case of AS hijacking, carried out in order to send spam from the victim’s network. We thoroughly investigate this AS hijacking incident using live data from both the control and the data plane. Our analysis yields insights into how an attacker proceeded in order <b>to</b> covertly <b>hijack</b> a whole autonomous system, how he misled an upstream provider, and how he used an unallocated address space. We further show that {{state of the art}} techniques <b>to</b> prevent <b>hijacking</b> are not fully capable of dealing with this kind of attack. We also derive guidelines on how to conduct future forensic studies of AS hijacking. Our findings show {{that there is a need}} for preventive measures that would allow <b>to</b> anticipate AS <b>hijacking</b> and we outline the design of an early warning system...|$|R
