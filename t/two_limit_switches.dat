The proposed cleaning system operates by spraying an amount {{of water on the}} PV panel surface and then actuating the wiper using a DC motor. <b>Two</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switches</b> are used to sense the wiper position {{at the edge of the}} PV panel.

The wiper can be managed to work periodically for example five times in a day or can be manually activated using remote control mechanism. The power consumption performances of the proposed system are only about 0. 79 % and 8. 94 % under standby and operation conditions, respectively.

Sonar has the opposite problem. Sonar has a very wide sensing angle. This means that when an obstacle is sensed the robot cannot discern the angular position of the obstacle. This type of sensing {{can lead to a}} shy robot, which will often trap itself. The solution is to create a scanning sensor as shown in Figure 2. The robot Woody, designed for the Spring 2009 IMDL course, used a Sharp GP 2 Y 0 A 02 YK sensor mounted on a stepper motor to collect 56 data points over a range of approximately 100 degrees. The stepper motor allowed for exact and repeatable alignment of the sensor, and the thin beam of the Sharp sensor created a detailed array of data. The scanning sensor also included <b>two</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switches</b> used for initializing the position of the stepper between the two extremes of the sensor’s range of motion. (The extreme positions of the scanning infrared sensor were the drive wheel locations that would have obstructed the infrared sensor.) Figure 1. Woody the firefighting robo...|$|E

40|$|At the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CBBAF), a 4 GeV {{multipass}} CW {{electron beam}} {{is to be}} accelerated by 338 SRF, 5 -cell niobium cavities operating at a resonant frequency of 1497 MHz. Eight cavities arranged as four pairs comprise a cryomodule, a cryogenically isolated linac subdivision. The frequency is controlled by a mechanical tuner attached to the fist and fifth cell of the cavity which elastically deforms the cavity and thereby alters its resonant frequency. The tuner is driven by a stepper motor mounted external to the cryomodule that transfers torque through two rotary feedthroughs. A linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) mounted on the tuner monitors the displacement, and <b>two</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switches</b> interlock the movement beyond a 400 kHz bandwidth. Since the cavity has a loaded Q of 6. 6. 106, the control system must maintain {{the frequency of the}} cavity to within * 50 Hz of the drive frequency for efficient coupling. This requirement is somewhat difficult to achieve since the difference in thermal contractions of the cavity and the tuner creates a frequency hysteresis of approximately 10 kHz. The cavity is also subject o frequency shifts due to pressure fluctuations of the helium bath as well as radiation pressure. This requires that each cavity be characterized in terms of frequency change as a function of applied motor steps to allow proper tuning operations. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical performance of the cavity tuner during the commissioning and operation of the cryomodules manufactured todate. I...|$|E
