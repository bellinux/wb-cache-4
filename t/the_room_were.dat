5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> found in the Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to {{the ruins of the}} castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{women were}} not {{positively}} identified until a week after their bodies' discovery, by which time they had been reported missing in Ohio by husband and father, Hal Rogers. On June 8, a housekeeper at the Days Inn said that the women's room had not been disturbed, and the beds had not been slept in. The hotel manager contacted the police. Fingerprints found in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> matched to the bodies; final confirmation of their identification came from dental records. Marine researchers at the University of South Florida estimated from currents and patterns that the women were thrown from a boatand not from a bridge or dry landbetween two and five days before they were found. The Rogers car, a 1984 Oldsmobile Calais with Ohio license plates, was found at the boat dock by the Courtney Campbell Causeway.|$|E

25|$|During an uncharacteristically wild {{party in}} his Moscow hotel room, he locked {{himself in his}} bedroom and {{attempted}} suicide by cutting his wrists.

25|$|In June 2005, Clark {{was cited}} and {{released}} on a misdemeanor battery charge after {{getting into a}} food fight during breakfast {{in a hotel room}} with his record company manager, Laura Kathleen Troy, and their entourage, which escalated into food and dishes being thrown. According to Sacramento Police Sergeant Justin Risley, both parties suffered scratches on their arms, but Troy did not press charges, and both Clark and Troy left in a vehicle together. Clark later apologized for the incident, explaining that his dancers, management team and record label representatives were also involved in the food fight, but that after they had left to get cleaned up, he and his manager, who stayed to clean up <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>were</b> the ones present when the police arrived.|$|E
25|$|Various {{elements}} within <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> formed with stone quarried from the battlefields of Europe: from the United Kingdom came Hoptonwood limestone; from Belgium, black marble {{for the wall}} plinths and altar steps, as well as St. Anne marble for the clustered columns that support the fan vault ceiling from each corner of the room; and from France, Château-Gaillard stone for {{the walls and the}} vault itself, as well as stone from Flanders' fields. These materials were worked into 700 carved elements by a number of different artists and sculptors under the direction of Ira Lake, who desired to tell not only the complete story of Canada's participation in the First World War, but also to commemorate military units {{as far back as the}} 17th century regime of New France.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the wall hangings, McKim, Meade & White commissioned {{a wide range of}} other furnishings more in line with their Louis XVI style salon de famille style. Marcotte and Co. supplied heavy velvet gold drapes, and topped each window with carved and gilded cornices of the company's own design. The existing pier tables were removed, and four richly carved and gilded Louis XVI Revival style console tables, also designed by Marcotte & Co., were placed between the pilasters. The existing seating was also removed, and Marcotte & Co. replaced it with 13 Louis XVI Revival gilded banquettes (upholstered benches). Marcotte & Co. also supplied new ornate gilded frames for each over-mantel mirror. A few items in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> reused, however. These included the mantel candelabra, manufactured by Russell & LaFarge and purchased in the Monroe administration in 1817.|$|E
25|$|On 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay {{and people}} {{involved}} with the website took place as ordered by judge Tomas Norström, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations.

The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three peopleGottfrid Svartholm, Mikael Viborg, and Fredrik Neijwere held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening. All servers in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> seized, including those running the website of Piratbyrån, an independent organisation fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities. Equipment such as hardware routers, switches, blank CDs, and fax machines were also seized.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts {{at the foot of the}} bed. Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E

25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E
500|$|The Sutherland Room lies at {{the rear}} east wing {{of the house and}} was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the {{occupants}} to sleep on the ground floor and guests to sleep on the first floor. This was still the case during the Holland restoration, and as a result the room was ignored, so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house. It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House, and the room has the original 17th-century cornice. The paintings in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John, Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting. After it ceased usage as a bedroom, on special occasions the room would be full of life; on Christmas Day the room would be [...] "transformed into a Christmas fairyland, with clockwork Santas, snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight". The children would have their places marked by a small cake with their names written on it in icing.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, {{to make sure}} there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that [...] "We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E

500|$|The {{property}} on Chancery Lane {{consisted of a}} Hall, dining room, a library, kitchens and offices for the Serjeants-at-Law. This Inn was originally known as [...] "Skarle's Inn" [...] from about 1390, named after John Scarle, who became Master of the Rolls in 1394. By 1404 it was known as [...] "Farringdon's Inn", but although the Serjeants were in full possession by 1416 {{it was not until}} 1484 that the property became known as Serjeant's Inn. Newly promoted Serjeants had to pay £350 in the 19th century, while those promoted solely to take up judicial office had to pay £500. The Hall was a large room hung with portraits of various famous judges and Serjeants-at-Law, with three windows on one side each containing the coat of arms of a distinguished judge. Around <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> the coats of arms of various Serjeants, which were given to their descendants when the Inn was finally sold. When the Fleet Street Inn was abandoned, this location became the sole residence of the Serjeants. With the demise of the order after the Judicature Act 1873, {{there was no way to}} support the Inn, and it was sold in 1877 for £57,100. The remaining Serjeants were accepted into their former Inns of Court, where judicial Serjeants were made Benchers and normal Serjeants barristers.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, musicians, and artists. Former McHale's Navy actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway reunited for their first joint TV project in 33 years as guest actors portraying SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Borgnine said [...] "We [...] played off each other. Tim's such a performer - a little more caustic than I am. We were making all sorts of noise. People outside <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> guffawing. We're supposed to be underwater, you know." [...] They would reprise {{their role in the}} episode [...] "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy II", which also guest starred Charles Nelson Reilly as their nemesis, the Dirty Bubble. In the episode [...] "Scaredy Pants", a Halloween special, American band the Ghastly Ones performed a special musical performance, while Brian Doyle-Murray voiced the Flying Dutchman. American country guitarist and singer Junior Brown made a vocal cameo, performing the song [...] "Texas" [...] in the episode of the same name. In [...] "Neptune's Spatula", John O'Hurley appeared as King Neptune. John Lurie and Jim Jarmusch (who collaborated to make the films Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law) made a cameo as themselves in the episode [...] "Hooky", through excerpts from the Bravo serial, Fishing with John.|$|E
2500|$|The ballroom {{occupied}} the entire north wing. It was accessed via the foyer through glass doors. The ballroom ceiling was plaster.

The west wall was bowed westward, to accommodate the orchestra balcony as it projected into the room. The room was lit by 10 brass wall sconces with three upward curving torch-arms. Hanging from the ceiling were three, 12-light crystal chandeliers with three hidden tiers. The fireplace in the east wall featured a cast iron firebox, framed by marble pilasters. It had a marble mantel, and a mirror overmantel in an 18th-century English style.|$|E

[...] By legend, when he announced his intent during a meeting on October 31, 1687, the candles in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> suddenly extinguished, and Joseph Wadsworth bore the document away and hid it in a cavity in the Charter Oak, a white oak as old as 1,000 years on {{the property of the}} Wyllys family. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which overthrew James, the charter was brought forth again. [...] The Charter Oak was uprooted in a storm on the night of August 21, 1856.|$|E
2500|$|The Tender Trap {{arrived in}} a vibrant period for eclectic {{contemporary}} clubs in Sydney, including Spicy Friday, Jamie and Vanessa's, The Sunset Club, Madd Club, Club Kooky, Get Down, and the bohemian Rat Parties. But from the beginning, The Tender Trap was aiming to recapture the vibe of swinging sixties Sydney in the perfect venue, [...] "a celebration of cocktail culture at its most sophisticated and savage". The Tender Trap referenced legendary Sydney clubs of an earlier era such as Chequers, The Latin Quarter, the Silver Spade Room, and Tabou. The essential mix was live cabaret entertainment, together with DJs playing their cherished vinyl LP collections featuring lounge music, jazz, Latin, funk, soul, and the incredibly strange. The original fixtures of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> embraced and enhanced, including red cloth-covered tables, candles, chandeliers, velvet flock wallpaper, and the central focus – the cabaret stage.

2500|$|Since {{the closure}} of the {{original}} Sublime Society in 1867, three separate efforts have been made to revive it in various forms. Sir Henry Irving, as proprietor of the Lyceum Theatre, had possession within his theatre of the society's last premises. [...] From about 1878 until his death in 1905, he hosted dinners in the society's dining room. [...] A biographer of Irving wrote, [...] "He wanted the Lyceum to have the same educational and intellectual force that Phelps' theatre had enjoyed in lslington." [...] A contemporary newspaper reported, [...] "Almost as soon as Mr. Irving undertook the management of the Lyceum he restored this venerable sanctuary to something like its former appearance, and very often now it is the scene of the informal and bright little supper parties which he delights to bring about him. … If the nocturnal gatherings in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> not of a private character we might say a good deal about them, especially as the guests frequently include men whose names are great." ...|$|E
