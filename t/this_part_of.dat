5|$|The pH of Messers Run {{upstream}} of the Lofty Reservoir is 6.3. The total {{concentration of}} alkalinity in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the stream is 3 milligrams per liter.

The concentration of water hardness in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the stream is 47 milligrams per liter.

5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed {{at the bottom of the}} stairway, and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E

5|$|Basin rests {{above the}} Boulder Batholith, the host rock for many {{valuable}} mineral ores found in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Montana.

Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the ground}} floor of the keep– made of {{hardened}} gravel– was dug up, probably to reuse for surfacing roads or pathways.

In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E

5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea.

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E

5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail in the painting. The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems more credible that <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under way, before its completion in the 1580s.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, brook trout, brown trout, {{and white}} suckers {{inhabited}} Scotch Run in its upper reaches.

The reason for {{the disappearance of the}} blacknose dace is unknown. The pumpkinseeds were only present in the 1970s due to their escape from nearby farm ponds.|$|E
