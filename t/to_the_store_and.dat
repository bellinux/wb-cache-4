5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a few items like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E
5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E

25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need you to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E
