500|$|After Lennon became famous, she berated him for {{speaking}} in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: [...] "That's showbusiness, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak more Liverpool". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E

500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing ... <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|Smith, aged 13 at the time, {{signed a}} record-breaking multi-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz in December 2008, {{six months after}} {{finishing}} outside the top three in the Britain's Got Talent series two final. Her debut album, Faryl, was released in March 2009. Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label. I'm really happy that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do another album so soon – I didn't think I would be working on one so quickly after the first one was released ... I'm just excited to get under way with it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to,</b> but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{and several}} other party roles merit further mention because they {{influence}} significantly the leader's overarching objective: retake majority control of the House.

Interviewed by the show's hosts Ant & Dec after leaving the jungle, he explained his reasons for participating: [...] "For a long time I've been doing serious stuff. Thirty years in the police and running for mayor. It's all bad news that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> comment on. So I thought why not come and do something trivial. ...

2500|$|Swanson was chagrined at {{the notion}} of {{submitting}} to a screen test, saying she had [...] "made twenty films for Paramount. Why do <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> audition?" [...] Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, [...] "Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount." [...] In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, [...] "If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you." [...] His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000.

That is NOT a confirmation like the guy posted. We haven't presented the idea to Nintendo... As with anything in the gaming industry, the whole thing could turn on a dime and many of the facts can change about the game. What these fans don’t understand is how squirly things are at the beginning of the game. It would take at least two years to bring out the game and that’s after we’ve confirmed the budget and platform. The game could just as easily go away, get moved to the iPhone or become a Jim Tetris knock off as come out as a game on the Wii.

2500|$|Listed as a 6'5" [...] forward/center in 2000, Turner was a 26-year-old rookie with Dungannon. At first, Turner didn't {{know what}} to make of Ireland. He was struck by the locals' {{hospitality}} and intrigued by the country's history, but he was initially unimpressed by the amenities and customs. Turner explained, [...] "I was still on my spoiled American high horse. 'The locker rooms are too small. I’ve got to carry my own bag. We don't practise enough. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> coach the local kids when I just want to play.' But when I went back to America for the Christmas break, I realised that I had to take my blinders off or I'd end up just like my friends at home, doing nothing or working in a job they hated." [...] He came to embrace the lifestyle and it showed on and off the court. However, while he was considered 'prolific' and made a significant contribution every game, he often lacked support in offensive situations. In a 92–74 loss to Tralee Tigers in January 2001, Turner had a 49-point effort.|$|E
2500|$|Director Masaru Konuma {{calls his}} own early S/M films [...] "European-type S/M," [...] and says, [...] "Later S/M {{developed}} in a very Japanese fashion. The Oniroku Dan way." [...] Konuma says that Dan described three purposes of S/M: [...] "for punishment, for confinement and {{for a sense of}} shame," [...] and that [...] "Oniroku Dan dislikes S as punishment... his novels and screenplays are centered around the 'humiliation' concept." [...] Dan confirmed Konuma's view by observing, [...] "My book editors often confuse S/M with cruelty and <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write some 'punishment tale' for them. This type of story is out of my realm. It just gives me the creeps. Rather, my concept of S/M is 'distorted sexual desire' or extreme disorientation. It's a male fantasy derived from love... from seeing a beauty suffer through the sense of shame. Therefore, my style contains a romantic, aesthetic, and sometimes decadent fragrance." [...] Konuma says of Dan's female characters, [...] "In his novels, he's searching for the beauty of women. He creates an ideal woman and proceeds to sell an S/M 'fantasy' to his readers." [...] According to Naomi Tani, Dan's perfect film actress must [...] "look good in a kimono; she needs to have long jet-black hair; she must have a certain amount of body fat, so that the bondage rope makes a clear impression on her skin; and she has to be graceful under torture, with strong facial expressions." ...|$|E
