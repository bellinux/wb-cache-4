The second floor was intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground floor was designed for business storerooms and a movie theater.

5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games.

Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, {{rather than as}} bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of}} the sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} {{to search for}} acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about a dysfunctional family <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> appear on The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa's brother—to be more interesting. Matt Groening, the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called The Simpsons. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom {{he succeeded}} as Premier), Tătărescu became a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war. Tătărescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} meeting was to persuade Marković to leave his {{position}} {{as the head of}} the Yugoslav federal government, which he appeared reluctant to do, and to discuss the need for Croatia's independence. The meeting was adjourned for lunch <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be attended by presidential aides. Tuđman made another effort at persuading Marković, trying to appeal to his Croatian origin. The three left the lunch as dessert was being served and moved into the president's office to continue their discussion. After Tuđman left the room, everyone else followed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be the final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{number of}} signal {{processing}} applications require {{the estimation of}} covariance matrices. Sometimes, the particular scenario or system imparts a certain theoretical structure on the matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated. Using this knowledge allows the design of algorithms exploiting such structure, resulting in more robust and accurate estimators, especially for small samples. We study a scenario with a measured covariance matrix known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Kronecker product of two other, possibly structured, covari-ance matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated. Examples of scenarios in which such a problem occurs are MIMO-communications and EEG measurements. When the matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated are Toeplitz structured, we show our algorithms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> achieve the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound already at very small sample sizes.

The 2012–13 season was blighted by injuries and patchy form: after opening the season with three wins and briefly heading the table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013.

As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (“the Queen of Congo”).|$|E
