5|$|The {{election}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in international media coverage. Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> held during the election weekend as it usually is. The journalists also got to ask questions to the representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background. The following day, <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Lorković {{was one of}} {{the most}} pro-German members of the pre-war Ustaše {{movement}} having cultivated political and academic ties in Germany during his time there.

Up to April 1943, he also served as the chief contact between Edmund Glaise von Horstenau, the Plenipotentiary General in the Independent State of Croatia, and the Pavelić cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club {{traces the}} arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as {{household}} pets of diplomats and others in <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>ministry.</b> The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; {{at the start of}} the 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.|$|E
5|$|Richard von Weizsäcker {{was born}} on 15 April 1920 in the New Castle in Stuttgart, the son of diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker, {{a member of the}} noted Weizsäcker family, and his wife Marianne (née von Graevenitz).

5|$|The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 (later {{known as}} Europe Day) {{occurred}} after two Cabinet meetings, when the proposal became French government policy. France was thus the first government {{to agree to}} surrender sovereignty in a supranational Community. That decision {{was based on a}} text, written and edited by Schuman's friend and colleague, <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> lawyer, professor Paul Reuter with the assistance of economist Jean Monnet and Schuman's Directeur de Cabinet, Bernard Clappier. It laid out a plan for a European Community to pool the coal and steel of its members in a common market.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. <b>The</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another was the reason he was being removed.|$|E

It also appointed diplomatic officers, with the exception of Soviet ambassadors, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers. The MER was responsible for taking care of the USSR's economic and political interests abroad, although economic interests were also the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The State Committee of the Council of Ministers on Cultural Links with Foreign Nations and the Ministry of Culture worked jointly with the MER in regards to the protection of Soviet citizens abroad, the exercise of overall Soviet consular relations abroad and the promotion of Soviet culture abroad. A less visible duty of the MER was its role in the coordination of Soviet intelligence operations abroad.|$|E

5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>ministry</b> for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt {{for more than a}} year, and who were in favor of peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E

5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody said later that he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 Danish krone and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E

Shortly after, the Government abruptly revoked his title as Tun in late November of the same year, making his disappearance in Australia a bewildering mystery.

25|$|The monarch is {{assisted}} in his diplomatic missions by <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry,</b> and high-ranking members of <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> are {{made available to}} the king when he is abroad representing Spain. The royal household coordinates with <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> to ensure successful diplomatic engagements. Additionally, other members of the royal family, most notably the Prince of Asturias, may represent the Spanish State internationally. Though the Spanish monarchy is independent of the government, it is important that royal speeches are compatible with government foreign policy to project a unified diplomatic effort. To achieve balance, royal household speechwriters confer with <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Ministry</b> to ensure that the official speeches strike the desired diplomatic tone between the king's views and government policy. When necessary and appropriate, the king and his government may focus on two different aspects in a diplomatic engagement. The king may emphasize one aspect, such as the promotion of democracy and historic relations; while the government focuses on the details of strategic planning and bilateral coordination.|$|E
