5|$|By 1934, the {{executive}} branch consisted of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies {{in addition to the}} constitutional officers, although the members of these commissions were often the constitutional officers themselves. Governor Ruby Laffoon proposed the Administrative Reorganization Act of 1934 to organize these boards and commissions into seventeen executive departments and seven independent agencies. The General Assembly passed <b>this</b> <b>legislation,</b> giving {{the executive}} branch some semblance of structure for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} intelligence, {{octopuses}} {{are listed in}} some countries as experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anesthesia, a protection usually extended only to vertebrates. In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) was the only invertebrate protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In 2012, <b>this</b> <b>legislation</b> was extended to include all cephalopods in accordance with a general EU directive.|$|E

5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under <b>this</b> <b>legislation</b> that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of <b>this</b> <b>legislation.</b> Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Bush {{announced}} the Clear Skies Act of 2003, aimed at amending the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution {{through the use}} of emissions trading programs. Many experts argued that <b>this</b> <b>legislation</b> would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal. The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.|$|E
5|$|In case any of {{this should}} be resisted, Parliament passed the Treasons Act 1534, which made it high treason {{punishable}} by death to deny Royal Supremacy. The following year, Thomas More and John Fisher were executed under <b>this</b> <b>legislation.</b> Finally, in 1536, Parliament passed the Act against the Pope's Authority, which removed {{the last part of}} papal authority still legal. This was Rome's power in England to decide disputes concerning Scripture.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2001, Universal Music Group {{was criticized}} for airing {{commercials}} promoting the album during episodes of Total Request Live.

5|$|The Nazi regime {{began to}} persecute Jews {{soon after the}} seizure of power. Hess's office was partly {{responsible}} for drafting Hitler's Nuremberg Laws of 1935, laws that had far-reaching implications for the Jews of Germany, banning marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and depriving non-Aryans of their German citizenship. Hess's friend Karl Haushofer {{and his family were}} subject to these laws, as Haushofer had married a half-Jewish woman, so Hess issued documents exempting them from <b>this</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tillman was {{the primary}} sponsor of the Tillman Act, the first federal {{campaign}} finance reform law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned corporate contributions in federal political campaigns.

5|$|Title VIII of the Act, {{commonly}} known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). <b>This</b> <b>legislation</b> was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made <b>this</b> <b>legislation</b> a nullity.|$|E

5|$|After {{requiring}} all Social Credit Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to sign loyalty oaths to it, the Social Credit Board {{proceeded to}} recommend radical legislation regulating banking, taxing banks, and restricting {{freedom of the}} press and access to courts. Most of <b>this</b> <b>legislation</b> was either disallowed by the federal government or ruled ultra vires (beyond the powers of) the province by the Supreme Court of Canada; these defeats and the advent of World War II made the Social Credit Board increasingly irrelevant. In its later years it became highly anti-Semitic, and it was dissolved by the government of Ernest Manning in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Hunting hare with beagles {{became popular}} again in Britain in {{the mid-19th century}} and {{continued}} until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under <b>this</b> <b>legislation</b> beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who {{do not wish to}} participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. <b>This</b> <b>legislation</b> authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of <b>this</b> <b>legislation.</b> Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|Republikflucht {{became a}} crime in 1957, {{punishable}} by heavy fines and up to three years' imprisonment. Any act associated with an escape attempt– including helping an escapee– was subject to <b>this</b> <b>legislation.</b> Those {{caught in the act}} were often tried for espionage as well and given proportionately harsher sentences. More than 75,000people– an average of more than seven people a day– were imprisoned for attempting to escape across the border, serving an average of one to two years' imprisonment. Border guards who attempted to escape were treated much more harshly and were on average imprisoned for five years.|$|E
