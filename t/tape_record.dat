2500|$|While {{attending}} the New York State Association of Counties conference on September 28, 2006, Hevesi {{had one of}} his state employed press aides <b>tape</b> <b>record</b> the speech of his opponent, Christopher Callaghan. On October 2, 2006, allegations arose that Hevesi fired receptionist Alexander McHugh, who filed a charge of sexual harassment. Hevesi's office stated that the receptionist did not cooperate with their investigation into the matter and [...] "...found no evidence of sexual harassment." [...] McHugh {{filed a complaint with}} the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.|$|E

Bud Smyth, a former race marshal and Iditarod musher, criticized race officials, saying the Iditarod officials were slow to interview and <b>tape</b> <b>record</b> witnesses.

2500|$|Although minutes would {{normally}} be kept of even executive sessions, the office administrator was asked to leave the room, and no record of that session was kept. [...] "Despite {{the fact that the}} meeting was closed, there still should have been a record of it, four former board members and a former staffer say. They say that Sharon Hansberry, the board's office administrator, ordinarily attends the meeting and takes notes. It was also a common practice around that time, they say, for her to <b>tape</b> <b>record</b> the meetings as well, even though the tapes were often destroyed once the minutes were formalized. Former members of the board say that Hansberry was asked to leave the room when the board went into executive session. A spokesman for the board says that there is no record of what occurred in the executive session – no tape recording of the executive session, or notes, or minutes." ...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Prospective randomly allocated study. SETTING [...] Child development centre, Birmingham Children's Hospital. SUBJECTS [...] Parents of 113 consecutive children attending for multidisciplinary developmental assessment. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Recall of information and use of, and views on, the written and <b>tape</b> <b>recorded</b> summaries. RESULTS [...] Parents who received the <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> showed no increase in recall of the summary's content six weeks later. Forty three per cent of English speaking parents favoured the <b>tape</b> <b>recorded</b> summary, as did 89 % of Urdu/Punjabi speaking parents. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Tape</b> <b>recorded</b> summaries were popular with parents, but other methods are needed to help parents, especially those whose first language is not English, to understand the implications of multidisciplinary assessment of their child...|$|R

2500|$|Tape echoes became commercially {{available}} in the 1950s. An echo machine is the early name for a sound processing device used with electronic instruments to repeat the sound and produce a simulated echo. The device was popular with guitarists and was used by Brian May, Jimmy Page and Syd Barrett among others. One example is the Echoplex which used a tape loop. [...] The length of delay was adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} <b>tape</b> <b>record</b> and playback heads. [...] Another example is the Roland Space Echo with a record and multiple playback tape heads and a variable tape speed. [...] The time between echo repeats was adjusted by varying the tape speed. [...] The length or intensity of the echo effect was adjusted by changing the amount of echo signal was fed back into the pre-echo signal. [...] Different effects could be created by combining the different playback heads. [...] Some models also included a spring reverb.|$|E
2500|$|The FA {{published}} a 63-page report regarding the disciplinary proceedings conducted by an Independent Regulatory Commission; it labelled aspects of Terry's defence as [...] "improbable, implausible and contrived," [...] finding it [...] "inherently unlikely {{that if he}} had been accused by Mr. Ferdinand of calling him something that ended with the words [...] "black cunt", that Mr. Terry would have added the word [...] "fucking" [...] when he threw the words back, if he was genuinely doing so by way of forceful denial" [...] and [...] "inherently improbable" [...] that he would call Anton Ferdinand a [...] "fucking knobhead" [...] for falsely accusing him of racial abuse. The Commission found it [...] "implausible" [...] that to robustly deny having used the words [...] "black cunt" [...] he [...] "simply repeated" [...] them. His defence in court was not that he had [...] "simply repeated" [...] the words but that he had [...] "sarcastically" [...] repeated them (see above), however, there was no reference to sarcasm in the Regulatory Commission's 63-page written report. The Commission concluded that it was [...] "quite satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there [...] no credible basis for Mr. Terry's defence that his use of the words 'fucking black cunt' were directed at Ferdinand by way of forceful rejection and/or inquiry. Instead, [...] quite satisfied, and [...] on the balance of probabilities, that the offending words were said by way of insult." [...] The FA commission was also criticised as a [...] "kangaroo court" [...] and the FA for its lack of independence, for failing to disclose all evidence to the police, failing to <b>tape</b> <b>record</b> their interview with key witness Ashley Cole, for lowering the required burden of proof after the incident had taken place, and for punishing Terry for an offence he had already been cleared of in a criminal court, in contravention of its own rules, which state that verdicts in criminal cases are [...] "presumed to be correct" [...] unless [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] to the contrary emerges. Terry's four-match ban was contrasted with Luis Suárez's eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra (Suárez received a longer ban for using the insults repeatedly) and a 14-year-old schoolboy's five-match ban for telling a referee his name was Santa Claus.|$|E
