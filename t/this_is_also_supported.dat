More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of Second Temple era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in Acre (Ptolemais).|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{becoming}} unpopular {{due to his}} resistance to democracy, during the German Occupation of Denmark he did become a popular symbol of resistance to German occupation, particularly because of the symbolic value {{of the fact that}} he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards. He also became the subject of a persistent urban legend according to which, during Nazi occupation, he donned the Star of David in solidarity with the Danish Jews. Danish Jews were not forced to wear the Star of David. However, the legend likely stems from a 1942 British report that claimed he threatened to don the star if this was forced upon Danish Jews, and was popularized when it was included in Leon Uris's best-selling novel, Exodus. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> by the king's personal diary, where the following entry can be found: ...|$|E
2500|$|The second quatrain argues {{against the}} {{hypothetical}} [...] "if" [...] that the speaker's [...] "dear love" [...] is the [...] "child of state". The speaker's love was created where it cannot be scathed by unpredictable events, an [...] "accident", the [...] "slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune" [...] (Hamlet Act III. Sc.i 3). The sonnet shifts to criticizing the transitory {{nature of the}} society in which the speaker and addressee exist. The love is not subject to, [...] "the whims of the powerful, the anger of tyrants, or the fads of mere fashion". In a historical context, in The Sonnets of Shakespeare, Raymond Alden suggests that, [...] "The time referred to is unmistakably that after the ascension of James; and the gunpowder plot is such a remarkable instance of a plot to strike a 'blow of thralled discontent'. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> by Lee who concurs in his analysis in Shakespeare's Sonnets.

2500|$|Throughout the {{publication}} of the series, there was some dispute about the exact ages of the Animorphs at the time they obtained the ability to morph. However, with the help of various hints {{in the course of the}} series, many fans guessed their ages to be approximately thirteen to fourteen (with thirteen being the more likely) at the start. For example, at the beginning of , Jake mentions having tried out for his junior high basketball team and not making it. [...] This puts Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, and Marco, at the very least, around the age of eleven to fourteen, as junior high (or middle school) in the United States is generally grades six through eight. [...] However, as Marco describes them as [...] "idiot teenagers with a death wish" [...] in the first book, it is very likely that some or most of them are older than twelve. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>supported</b> in , when Rachel looks at a photo [...] "taken a couple of years ago" [...] of her and Melissa Chapman, taken on Melissa's [...] "twelfth birthday, or some birthday." [...] Although Rachel cannot remember what birthday it was, this supports the idea that the Animorphs are either thirteen or fourteen. In , Rachel states that Jake is [...] "not even in high school." [...] This suggests that none of the characters are, because they eat lunch together in school earlier in that book. [...] definitively confirms the characters attending middle school when Jake, in the first chapter, says that he is [...] "a middle-school kid" [...] in his narration. Also, in , Jake wakes up one morning as a twenty-five-year-old, and in the preview for that book in the previous one, it says he sleeps for a decade, suggesting that his age was fifteen before his journey into the future.|$|E
