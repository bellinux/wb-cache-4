5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the 2007 World Cup the Queen's Park Oval has had a sporadic allotment of ODIs, with no matches being played there in 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016. The ground last hosted ODIs in June 2017 when two (2) matches against India were played <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> period of time the ground did host its first Twenty20 International, against England as a one-off match. The hosts defeated England comfortably thanks largely to a score of 59 from 46 balls by Ramnaresh Sarwan, which leaves him to date the highest scorer and most prolific run-maker at the ground in T20 Internationals. The ground hosted another Twenty20 International against Zimbabwe in February 2010 and against India in 2011. No Twenty20 Internationals has been played since.|$|E

25|$|The TCA ground has {{primarily}} {{been used}} throughout its 127-year history for cricket and Australian football. However, many other sports have been played there. When the ground first opened in 1882, {{there was also}} two tennis courts, which were later moved to the Domain Tennis Centre. There was also a skittles alley, and the wooden building {{on the eastern side}} of the ground built in 1911 which still exists was the TCA bowls club.

25|$|In 1526, the Bohemian estates elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg. The fervent Catholicism of {{its members}} was to bring them into {{conflict}} in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity. These problems were not pre-eminent under Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in the Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> age include the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, the painter Arcimboldo, the alchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee, the poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, and others.|$|E

She {{remained at the}} air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to Hunters Point Navy Yard to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty {{in conjunction with the}} return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in Apra Harbor on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to Samar in the Philippines, she was diverted to Manila en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to Bremerton, Washington, where she was placed in reserve while still in commission, on 21 June. She remained <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> status {{through the end of the}} year.

He remained {{a major political}} figure, leading the committee of notables that welcomed John Quincy Adams to Buffalo, and the former president expressed his regret at Fillmore's absence from the halls of Congress. Some urged Fillmore to run for vice president with Clay, the consensus Whig choice for president in 1844—Horace Greeley wrote privately that [...] "my own first choice has long been Millard Fillmore"—others thought Fillmore should try to win back the governor's mansion for the Whigs. Fillmore wanted the vice presidency, {{and it did not}} take him long after he came back from Washington for him to seek to return <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> capacity.|$|E

Some of the benches were simply planks put on top of empty nail kegs. There was no elevated platform, as the ceiling was only eight feet high. Initially there was no pulpit. Frank Bartleman, an early participant in the revival, recalled that [...] "Brother Seymour generally sat behind two empty shoe boxes, {{one on top of the}} other.

2500|$|In another {{scene in}} which a {{character}} dies from solar exposure among the ashes from cremated bodies, massive wind turbines propelled biodegradable dust at the actor in the director's attempt to have the computer-generated effects follow the actor instead of vice versa. Boyle commented on his approach to using effects, [...] "There {{is part of our}} brain where we admire the effect, but we put it in a side compartment of our experience because you know there's no way an actor can live through that, or be <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment." [...] During the post-production process, Boyle hired one visual effects company, London's Moving Picture Company, to work on the film's 750 visual effects. The assignment of a single company was contrary to the industry trend of hiring multiple vendors to work on a film's effects. Boyle chose one company for ease of quality control, though the decision resulted in a prolonged post-production process.|$|E

When we carried my father's coffin down to the graveyard, the crane sat <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> tree and hollered.

In a 1980 interview, Holder said: [...] "I really liked it [...] mentioned to {{the others in the}} band that I'd heard a really great Chuck Berry number". After spending time trying to get hold of a copy of the song, Holder obtained Berry's the album of the same name from an import shop. Holder revealed: [...] "After listening to it, we started to play it live on stage, first of all just as a jam {{at the end of the}} set.

Reiss initially wrote the film, {{which was based on}} his experience on holiday bus tours of Mexico and Greece, as a short story. After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy".
