In October 1970, he performed with Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, and the Canadian band Chilliwack at a Vancouver benefit concert that funded Greenpeace's protests of 1971 {{nuclear weapons tests}} by the US Atomic Energy Commission at Amchitka, Alaska; this performance was released in album format in 2009 as Amchitka, The 1970 Concert That Launched Greenpeace.

25|$|The {{presence}} in the Cook Islands of sweet potato that is a plant native to the Americas (called kūmara in Māori), which have been radiocarbon-dated to 1000 CE, has been cited as evidence that Americans could have traveled to Oceania. The current thinking is <b>that</b> <b>sweet</b> potato was brought to central Polynesia circa 700 CE and spread across Polynesia from there, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back. An alternative explanation posits biological dispersal; plants and/or seeds could float across the Pacific without any human contact.|$|E

Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. [...] "This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a lot about how you're playing the game", he explained.

500|$|Jimi Hendrix {{began his}} career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and {{performed}} and recorded with several popular R artists, including the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, and Little Richard. He learned from other R guitarists, including Curtis Mayfield, who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording. [...] Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963. [...] He described the experience: [...] "The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. [...] Curtis was a really good guitarist... I learned a lot in that short time. [...] He probably influenced me more than anyone I'd ever played with up to that time, <b>that</b> <b>sweet</b> sound of his, you know". [...] In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled [...] "(My Girl) She's a Fox" [...] with the Icemen, an R duo. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as [...] "paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [...] is virtually a blueprint for 'Little Wing'". [...] Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to [...] "She's a Fox" [...] (included on the 2010 [...] ) [...] "perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career. [...] Hendrix's Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song's strongest attribute".|$|E

500|$|Lauer {{thought that}} the surge in {{interest}} in bacon products prior to the book's publication was [...] "media driven". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be [...] "the one thing that people are unwilling to give up". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit {{an end to the}} trend of interest in bacon. She commented, [...] "Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it— <b>that</b> <b>sweet</b> and salty combination of flavors." [...] She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. [...] "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon," [...] said Lauer. She stated that [...] "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen." [...] The book was marketed as the [...] "most comprehensive book about bacon to date". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).|$|E

[...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{described it as a}} song that [...] "reflect a contemporary trend for fast, furious and funny mash ups of conflicting ideas, constantly teetering on the edge of collapse but pulling out another beat or hook to keep things moving." [...] In a similar mode, Kyler Anderson of Entertainment Weekly confessed that he thought the song would be his [...] "most-skipped track," [...] but admitted that he [...] "kind of admire its barely-conscious chaos." [...] James Grebey of Spin dismissed Tyson's inclusion, however he praised the song for having a statement that is the album's lynchpin and that [...] "ith its robotic, authoritarian droning, 'Iconic' conveys the point that — love her or hate her — Madonna is an icon, and you’re not getting rid of her anytime soon." [...] John Marrs of Gay Times gave the track four out of five stars, claiming that [...] "the finished product is wholly different from the demo and much more gutsy, getting better with every play." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy defined it as [...] "a club-ready dash of trap-pop" [...] and selected the song as one of the [...] "tracks to download". Nick Levine of Time Out agreed, writing that [...] "the sassy stuff is excellent, especially the catchy, trap-tinged 'Iconic'." ...|$|E
500|$|During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs {{started with}} a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach, and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 31–5 run. The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella story New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals. In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero, and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the [...] "Twin Towers" [...] outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks. After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot, and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship. The accolades for the Spurs soon arrived, with Sports Illustrated reporting that the San Antonio [...] "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were no longer known as the [...] "San Antonio softies". The magazine praised Finals MVP Duncan, who was later quoted: [...] "This is incredible. We kept our focus and we pulled it out." [...] Sports Illustrated journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: [...] "Duncan came up big each time they went to him with <b>that</b> <b>sweet</b> turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [...]" [...] And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: [...] "I've got Tim [...] and you don't. That's the difference." ...|$|E

[...] Music writer Max Haymes argues that Johnson's intention was [...] "the land of California or <b>that</b> <b>sweet</b> home Chicago".
