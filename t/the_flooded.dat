50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flood</b> pulse helps {{maintain}} {{genetic and}} species diversity in <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> plain ecosystem, and it brings in oxygen to help fauna and decomposition. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> pulse also increases yields {{by increasing the}} surface area of water and showers the land with river biota. Flood plain systems also serve as migration routes, hibernation spots, and spawning locations for many species. For the red-bellied piranha, their two annual reproductive seasons are dependent on <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> pulse. However, <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> pulse has <b>the</b> potential to overpower some species; when flood pulses occur at unusual times or last for too long, terrestrial vegetation can be overwhelmed.

5|$|D-Day at Utah {{began at}} 01:30, {{when the first}} of the {{airborne}} units arrived, tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte-Mère-Église and controlling the causeways through <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> farmland behind Utah so the infantry could advance inland. While some airborne objectives were quickly met, many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day. On the beach itself, infantry and tanks landed in four waves beginning at 06:30 and quickly secured the immediate area with minimal casualties. Meanwhile, engineers set to work clearing the area of obstacles and mines, and additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive. At the close of D-Day, Allied forces had only captured about half of the planned area and contingents of German defenders remained, but the beachhead was secure.|$|E

5|$|Paratroops from 101st Airborne {{were dropped}} {{beginning}} around 01:30, tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve River. The C-47s could not fly {{in a tight}} formation because of thick cloud cover, and many paratroopers were dropped far from their intended landing zones. Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both flak and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes {{did not have time}} to open, and others drowned in <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> fields. Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls, and marshes. Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.|$|E
5|$|The storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35inches (161mm) in La Villita, Michoacán. Flooding from {{four days of}} rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> houses. In total, 20homes were destroyed, and 20villages were left without power. A transport vehicle carrying 15people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; the truck was later rescued by police workers. About 300hectares (740acres) of crop fields sustained damage; however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended. Across Mexico, the storm affected about 500,000people, and initially there were two people missing; however, a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains from Auring {{triggered}} flooding {{across the}} eastern provinces of the Philippines. A total of 38,764 people were evacuated to avoid floodwaters. The rains caused the Cagayan River to swell, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in Gingoog City. In Talisay City, Cebu, a 27-year-old woman was killed after she was electrocuted by a steel wire which was knocked down by high winds produced by Auring. Nine other people, all of whom are children, were listed as missing. About 12,211 people were left stranded at ports due to dangerous conditions caused by the depression. An additional 14 trucks, 44 light cars, 75 passenger buses, 27 vessels and 295 rolling cargoes were also stranded. Severe flooding destroyed 305 homes, 199 of which were in Macasandig. Another 610 homes sustained damage. An estimated 53hectares (130.9acres) of rice and 3.5hectares (8.6acres) of corn were damaged. About 43,851 people were affected by the storm, mainly along the Cagayan River. The remnants of Auring brought heavy rains to <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> areas again on January7, triggering several landslides which blocked off roads and damaging power lines, leaving parts of the Catanduanes without power for several hours. Damages from the depression were estimated at PHP23million ($498,318USD) and an estimated 5,000 families were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> mail room.

5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and water service was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E
5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow.

Residents who met the requirements to receive federal aid were eligible for funding for temporary housing. People who lost their jobs due to the flooding were eligible for unemployment grants for 26 weeks starting {{the day of the}} disaster declaration. Residents were able to receive up to $200,000 for home damages; up to $40,000 in personal possession losses; and up to $2million for business losses. By October17, more than $5.6million in disaster aid was approved for 20,284 residences. Community Relations teams visited about 7,000 people. Out of the 4,140 small-business loans applications, only 288 were submitted by this time. By October25, the amount of funds nearly doubled, reaching $11million. At this time, more than, 24,500 residents applied for disaster loans. Survey teams checked over 18,000 homes for flood-related damages at this time also. Funding reached $16.5million by November7, with 29,000 people requesting federal assistance. By December5, funding for 37,000 residents reached $23.1million. At this time, the deadline for federal assistance requests was set for January15, 2009. On January2, 2009, funding for small businesses was being provided, with $6million being contributed. Grants for residents also reached $25million. After <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> rivers crested and receded, bulldozers began clearing mud covered streets.|$|E
