500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before departing the United States {{to rejoin}} his {{reconnaissance}} squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exupéry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform {{at the door}} of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a [...] "rumpled paper bag", placed onto her home's entryway table, offering, [...] "I'd like to give you something splendid, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have". Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks. The Morgan later acquired the 30,000 word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exupéry's work. [...] The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author's personal letters from the Saint Exupéry-d'Gay Estate, as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France. Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exupéry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter Sis on his new work The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, ...|$|E

60|$|It {{struck me}} as an odd {{coincidence}} that I should see the man again in London, so soon after I had met with him in Yorkshire. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> thought about it, at the time.
