50|$|A {{fairly small}} lark, the crested lark {{is roughly the}} same size as a Eurasian skylark, but shorter overall and bulkier around the head and body, and very similar in appearance, with a height of 17 cm and a {{wingspan}} of 29 to 38 cm, weighing between 37 and 55 g. It is a small, brown bird which has a short tail with light brown outer feathers. Male and females have no real differences, but young crested larks have more spots on their back than their older counterparts. Its plumage is downy but sparse and appears whitish. The distinct crest from which the crested lark gets its name is conspicuous at all times but is more pronounced during territorial or courtship displays and when singing. In flight it shows reddish underwings. It shares many characteristics with the <b>Thekla</b> <b>lark,</b> with the main distinctions between the two being the Thekla's heavier black-brown streaks and its grey underwing, present in European specimens.|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} twenty microsatellite markers for the Dupont 0 s lark (Chersophilus duponti), one of {{the most}} endangered European bird species, and tested in two related, more widely distributed species: crested lark (Galerida cristata) and <b>thekla</b> <b>lark</b> (Galerida theklae). 14 markers amplified and were polymorphic in Dupont 0 s lark, 11 in crested lark and 6 in <b>thekla</b> <b>lark.</b> Microsatellite var- iability analyses were carried out on Dupont 0 s lark (N = 23 – 28 individuals), crested lark (N = 9 – 10) and <b>thekla</b> <b>lark</b> (N = 14) populations in NE Spain showing moderate/high diversity, ranging from 1 to 13 alleles per locus. The mean allelic richness in Dupont’s lark was 6. 21 and expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 195 to 0. 848 and from 0. 071 to 0. 889, respectively. Crested and thekla larks showed moderate/high diversity with a mean allelic richness of 4. 36 and 4. 67, respectively. This microsatellite set could be useful for population genetic studies of lark species widely differing in popula- tion fragmentation and conservation status across the Old World. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. —Seasonal and interannual {{variability}} in laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four lark species in Mediterranean Spain Aims: To describe {{the variation in}} laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four lark species (Skylark Alauda arvensis, Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla, <b>Thekla</b> <b>Lark</b> Galerida theklae and Lesser Short-toed Lark Calandrella rufescens) and at two different time scales: between years (large-scale variation), and within seasons (short-scale variation). Location: Two climatically contrasting Mediterranean areas: Layna, located in {{the centre of the}} Iberian Peninsula and with a continental Mediterranean climate, and Cabo de Gata, located in the south-western Iberian Peninsula and with a semi-arid climate. Breeding Skylarks and Short-toed Larks occur in Layna, whereas breeding Thekla Larks and Lesser Short-toed Larks occur in Cabo de Gata. Methods: During the study period between 1991 - 95 in Layna and between 1991 - 94 and 1996 - 97 in Cabo de Gata, searches were carried out for nests of the four species and laying date, measured egg-length and width, and hatching asynchrony recorded. Overall, 118 nests of Skylarks, 165 of Short-toed Larks, 334 of Thekla Larks and 259 of Lesser Short-toed Larks were studied. Between-year variations in breeding parameters were analysed with General Linear Models (GLM’s). To investigate the presence or absence o...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of the behavioural processes associated with competitor coexistence may vary when different physical environments, and their biotic communities, come into contact, although empirical evidence of how interference varies across gradients of environmental complexity is still scarce in vertebrates. Here, I analyse how behavioural interactions and habitat selection regulate the local distribution of steppeland larks (Alaudidae) in a gradient from simple to heterogeneous agricultural landscapes in Spain, using crested lark Galerida cristata and <b>Thekla</b> <b>lark</b> G. theklae as study models. Galerida larks significantly partitioned by habitat but frequently co-occurred in heterogeneous environments. Irrespective of habitat divergence, however, the local densities of the two larks were negatively correlated, and the mechanisms beyond this pattern were investigated by means of playback experiments. When simulating the intrusion of the congener by broadcasting the species territorial calls, both larks responded with an aggressive response as intense with respect to warning and approach behaviour as when responding to the intrusion of a conspecific. However, birds promptly responded to playbacks only when congener territories were nearby, a phenomenon that points to learning as the mechanisms through which individuals finely tune their aggressive responses to the local competition levels. Heterospecifics occurred in closer proximity in diverse agro-ecosystems, possibly because of more abundant or diverse resources, and here engage in antagonistic interactions. The drop of species diversity associated with agricultural homogenisation is therefore likely to also bring about {{the disappearance of the}} behavioural repertoires associated with species interactions. The research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (CGL 2008 - 02749 grant). Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{major impact}} of Plio-Pleistocene climatic {{oscillations}} {{on the current}} genetic structure of many species is widely recognised but their importance in driving speciation remains a matter of controversies. In addition, since most studies focused on Europe and North America, the influence of many other biogeographic barriers such as the Sahara remains poorly understood. In this paper, climate-driven diversification was investigated by using a comparative phylogeographic approach in combination with phenotypic data in two avian species groups distributed {{on both sides of}} the deserts belt of Africa and Asia. In particular, we tested whether: 1) vicariance diversification events are concomitant with past climatic events; and 2) current ecological factors (using climate and competition as proxies) contribute to phenotypic divergence between allopatric populations. Results Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data indicated that the crested and <b>Thekla</b> <b>lark</b> species groups diverged in the early Pliocene and that subsequent speciation events were congruent with major late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic events. In particular, steep increase in aridity in Africa near 2. 8 and 1. 7 million years ago were coincident with two north-south vicariance speciation events mediated by the Sahara. Subsequent glacial cycles of the last million years seem to have shaped patterns of genetic variation within the two widespread species (G. cristata and G. theklae). The Sahara appears to have allowed dispersal from the tropical areas during climatic optima but to have isolated populations north and south of it during more arid phases. Phenotypic variation did not correlate with the history of populations, but was strongly influenced by current ecological conditions. In particular, our results suggested that (i) desert-adapted plumage evolved at least three times and (ii) variation in body size was mainly driven by interspecific competition, but the response to competition was stronger in more arid areas. Conclusion Climatic fluctuations of the Plio-Pleistocene strongly impacted diversification patterns in the Galerida larks. Firstly, we found that cladogenesis coincides with major climatic changes, and the Sahara appears to have played a key role in driving speciation events. Secondly, we found that morphology and plumage were strongly determined by ecological factors (interspecific competition, climate) following vicariance. </p...|$|E

50|$|<b>Thekla's</b> <b>lark</b> is {{native and}} {{resident}} in France, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Tunisia and Western Sahara. Its typical habitat is rugged areas with scrub, bare patches of ground and semi-arid grassland.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Thekla's</b> <b>lark</b> (Galerida <b>theklae)</b> breeds on the Iberian Peninsula, in {{northern}} Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Somalia. It is a sedentary (non-migratory) species. This {{is a common}} bird of dry open country, often at some altitude. <b>Thekla's</b> <b>lark</b> was named by Alfred Edmund Brehm in 1857 for his recently deceased sister Thekla Brehm (1833-1857). The name is a modern Greek one, Θέκλα (Thekla), which comes from ancient Greek Θεόκλεια (Theokleia) derived from θεός (theos, [...] "god") and κλέος (kleos, [...] "glory" [...] or [...] "honour"). The population is declining in Spain, {{but this is a}} common bird with a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
40|$|In Iberian cereal-steppes, {{decoupling}} {{of payments}} from current production levels through the Single Farm Payment raised concerns regarding {{the potential for}} land abandonment and replacement of sheep by cattle, with eventual negative consequences for declining grassland birds. This study addressed this issue by analysing the responses of five grassland bird species of conservation concern to spatial land use gradients, which are expected to reflect changes potentially associated with the CAP reform. Our results show that both habitat fragmentation and grazing regimes were major drivers of breeding bird densities, though responses to these factors were species-specific. <b>Thekla</b> <b>larks</b> were most abundant in landscapes with small grassland patches and high edge density, whereas calandra larks were abundant only in large expanses of continuous open farmland habitat. Little bustard and short-toed lark densities declined in highly fragmented landscapes, but they appeared to tolerate or even benefit from low to moderate levels of open habitat fragmentation. Corn buntings were little affected by landscape patterns. At the field scale, little bustard and corn bunting densities were highest in fields grazed by cattle, whereas short-toed larks were mostly associated with sheep pastures. Short-toed <b>larks</b> and <b>Thekla</b> <b>larks</b> were most abundant in old fallow fields where cattle was largely absent, whereas corn buntings showed the inverse pattern. These results confirm {{the view that the}} same agricultural policies may be favourable for some species of conservation concern but detrimental to others, and so they cannot be assumed to bring uniform conservation benefits...|$|R
