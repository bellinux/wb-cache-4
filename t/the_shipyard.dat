The workers were led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> late {{in the morning of}} August 14. The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wałęsa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other social concerns.

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} {{to identify}} an alternative incentive system and {{determine whether it}} is feasible to implement it at <b>the</b> Turkish Naval <b>Shipyards.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of the incentive system would be to help <b>the</b> <b>shipyards</b> decrease cycle time and total cost, and increase productivity and readiness. This thesis also researches to determine the structural and statutory constraints {{to the implementation of}} such an incentive system. The thesis examined the current structure, routine processes, productivity, and compensation system at <b>the</b> Turkish Naval <b>Shipyards.</b> In this thesis, Arena Simulation Software is used to simulate and analyze the current overhaul process within <b>the</b> <b>shipyards.</b> <b>The</b> thesis also examined the alternative incentive systems that can be implemented at <b>the</b> <b>shipyards.</b> This thesis proposes a viable incentive system for <b>the</b> Turkish Naval <b>Shipyards.</b> NANATurkish Navy author...|$|R

5|$|During May 2009, {{the repairs}} were {{reported}} to be almost complete and new sea trials were planned for 15–20 June. By October 2009, the work had still not been completed due to the shipyard's electrical supply having been disconnected.

5|$|Phips {{established}} a shipyard on the Sheepscot River at Merrymeeting Bay in Maine in 1675 at {{the outbreak of}} King Philips War. <b>The</b> <b>shipyard</b> was successful, turning {{out a number of}} small boats and building its first large merchant ship in 1676. As he was preparing for its maiden voyage in August 1676, planning to deliver a load of lumber to Boston, a band of Indians descended on the area during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1676). Rather than take on his cargo, he took on board as many of the local settlers as he could. Although he was financially ruined (the Indians destroyed <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> and his intended cargo of masts and lumber), Phips was considered a hero among the colonists in Boston.|$|E

5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary.

In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{was given}} her name by President George Washington after a {{principle}} of the United States Constitution. Her keel was reportedly laid down late in 1795 at a shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. James Hackett was charged with her construction and Captain James Sever served as a superintendent. Her construction proceeded slowly and was completely suspended when in March 1796, a peace treaty was signed with Algiers. Congress remained at <b>the</b> <b>shipyard,</b> incomplete, until relations with France deteriorated in 1798 with {{the start of the}} Quasi-War. At the request of then President John Adams, funds were approved on 16 July to complete her construction.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} the Autumns dry dock, Carter is {{critically}} wounded. He rams his ship into a Covenant mobile assault platform, allowing Six and Emile to safely reach <b>the</b> <b>shipyard.</b> Emile uses a mass driver emplacement to defend the Autumn while Six fights through Covenant ground forces to get Cortana to the Autumns captain, Jacob Keyes. When Emile is slain by Elites, Six remains behind to control the gun, ensuring the Autumns escape. The Autumn flees from Reach and discovers a Halo ringworld, leading directly {{to the events of}} Halo: Combat Evolved.|$|E
5|$|Following the collision, Melbourne {{travelled}} to Singapore {{for temporary}} repairs to her bow, arriving on 6 June. Melbourne departed Singapore on 27 June and arrived in Sydney on 9 July, where the carrier underwent almost identical repairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard as in 1964 (primarily {{the installation of}} a new bow section). However, an industrial dispute amongst <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> workers meant that, although the work was completed in early September, the ship remained in the drydock until 11 October.|$|E

50|$|During World War II Dumbarton {{was heavily}} bombed by the German air force. The Germans were {{targeting}} <b>the</b> <b>shipyards,</b> and <b>the</b> {{area in the}} vicinity of the yards was consequently hit, with Clyde and Leven Street being severely damaged. In an attempt to lure the German aircraft away from <b>the</b> <b>shipyards,</b> decoy lights were routinely placed on the Kilpatrick hills above the town, lights were set out on reservoirs to mimic those of <b>the</b> <b>shipyards</b> reflecting on <b>the</b> waters of the Leven and Clyde. The ploy was sometimes successful in diverting the bombers and many bombs fell harmlessly onto the moors and lochs.|$|R
5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. <b>The</b> <b>shipyard</b> {{attempted}} to launch her on 16 July 1874, but she stuck fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and stuck, extensively damaging her bottom plating. She was finally launched on 10 September, after she had been lightened, and she was towed to Samuda Brothers for repairs and fitting out. The cost of the accident resulted in the bankruptcy of Dudgeons in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Hermes {{was laid}} down by Sir W. G. Armstrong-Whitworth and Company at Walker on the River Tyne on 15 January 1918 as the world's first purpose-designed {{aircraft}} carrier, and was launched on 11 September 1919. She was christened by Mrs. A. Cooper, daughter of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Walter Long. <b>The</b> <b>shipyard</b> was scheduled to close {{at the end of}} 1919 and the Admiralty ordered the ship towed to Devonport, where she arrived in January 1920 for completion.|$|E
5|$|His {{next project}} was to develop Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which became the world's largest shipyard. Opened as Chesapeake Dry Dock & Construction Company, the {{shipbuilding}} was intended to build boats to transition goods from the rails to the seas. With president Theodore Roosevelt's declaration to create a Great White Fleet, the company entered the warship business by building seven of the first sixteen warships. Today, <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> holds a dominant position in the American warship construction business.|$|E

5|$|Kaga entered <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> on 15 December 1938, {{where her}} {{arrester}} gear {{was replaced by}} a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized. The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and Kaga embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M fighters, 24 Aichi D1A dive bombers and 36 Yokosuka B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{arrived in}} Sydney with the {{survivors}} on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at Garden Island, {{was moved to}} Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship's internal structure were undertaken in drydock, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed. Once this was completed, Melbourne was removed while the new bow {{was put in place}} in the drydock; Melbourne was then returned to the drydock where her new bow was fitted. The work was eventually completed on 27 April, with <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> receiving a commendation.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1862, the Italian Navy {{placed an}} order with the British {{shipyard}} Mare of Millwall, London, for an armoured steam ram, to a design by the Italian naval officer Simone Antonio Saint-Bon, but financial problems {{resulted in the}} order being transferred to <b>the</b> <b>shipyard</b> Harrison, also of Millwall.
