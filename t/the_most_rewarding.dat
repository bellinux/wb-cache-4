Although some operational metrics declined during the period, the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents. The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation, while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal.

500|$|In 1962 Sellers {{played a}} retired British army general in John Guillermin's Waltz of the Toreadors, {{based on the}} play of the same name. The film was widely criticised for its slapstick {{cinematic}} adaption, and director Guillermin himself considered the film an [...] "amateurish" [...] effort. However, Sellers won the San Sebastián International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by the critics. Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers {{to play the role}} of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film Lolita, opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters. Kubrick had seen Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes and listened to the album The Best of Sellers, and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was according to Sellers [...] "a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist". Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he would often reach a [...] "state of comic ecstasy". Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> of his career. Writing in The Sunday Times, Dilys Powell noted that Sellers gave [...] "a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy". Towards the end of 1962, Sellers appeared in The Dock Brief, a legal satire directed by James Hill and co-starring Richard Attenborough.|$|E

500|$|The Arcadia Conference, {{which was}} held in Washington, D.C., December 1941 and January 1942, {{mandated}} {{the creation of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff as a counterpart to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Smith was named as its secretary on 23 January 1942. The same conference also brought about the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which consisted of the (American) Joint Chiefs of Staff and the (British) Chiefs of Staff Committee meeting as a single body. Brigadier Vivian Dykes of the British Joint Staff Mission provided the secretarial arrangements for the new organization at first, but General Marshall thought that an American secretariat was required. He appointed Smith as the secretary of the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{as well as of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since Dykes was senior in service time to Smith, and Marshall wanted Smith to be in charge, Smith was promoted to brigadier general on 2 February 1942. He assumed the new post a week later, with Dykes as his deputy. The two men worked in partnership to create and organize the secretariat, and to build the organization of the [...] Combined Chiefs-of-Staff into one that could coordinate the war efforts of the two allies, along with the Canadians, Australians, French and others. Smith's duties involved taking part in discussions of strategy at the highest level, and he often briefed President Roosevelt on strategic matters. However Smith became frustrated as he watched other officers receive operational commands that he desired. He later remarked: [...] "That year I spent working as secretary of the general staff for George Marshall was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> of my entire career, and the unhappiest year of my life." ...|$|E

The reviewer of GamesRadar also criticised Rare's [...] "old habit" [...] of [...] "collect-a-thons", asserting that {{all the elements of}} the game were [...] "clumsily put together" [...] and the aspects of unlocking new levels were difficult to understand due to the many items that were pre-required. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer heralded the vehicle construction as [...] "fun", however he criticised Rare's [...] "habit of forcing the player" [...] to collect large quantities of items to build their vehicles and progress through the game. A reviewer of GameTrailers similarly criticised the vehicular theme of the game, citing that the sensitive physics and controls adds up to an overall frustrating experience. Erik Brudvig of IGN US praised the game's absence of platform elements, and asked fans of Banjo-Kazooie not to [...] "write the game off" [...] due to its change in genre. Brudvig also heralded the vehicle-creation as [...] "powerful" [...] and the depth of the game's mechanics. However, Matt Wales of IGN UK criticised the new direction of the game's genre, summarising the lack of platforming action as [...] "screwed up". Wales stated that the game's mechanics and vehicle construction [...] "fails badly" [...] {{due to the lack of}} [...] "any fundamentally engaging" [...] framework to support the game's creative elements. Tom Orry of VideoGamer praised the complex construction of vehicles and stated that it was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> aspect of the game. Chris Kohler of Wired heavily criticised the mechanics, challenges and new genre of the game, panning the overall experience as a [...] "disappointing, simplistic sandbox".
