A procedure is presented to determine both the adhesion and frictional properties of soil-geosynthetic interfaces under very low confining pres-sures using a <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> test. A simple <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> device was developed and a series of tests were conducted on three different types of sand in contact with smooth and tex-tured geomembranes under dry and moist conditions.

40|$|Sliding of rock masses along penetrative {{discontinuities}} cam be simulated by rock blocks slide along inclined planes. Shearing strengths along penetrative discontinuities {{are determined}} by friction and cohesion along the sliding planes. Determination of friction angles of rocks and discontinuities is essential for evaluation of stability of rock slopes. The use of direct shear boxes requires careful transport of specimens from the field, cutting rocks to specified shapes, lapping rock surfaces if necessary and spending {{at least a day}} to test a sample. Since Hoek and Brary (1974) first suggested that the angle of friction could be obtained from a simple tilt test when a clearly defined failure surface existed, friction angles of artificial rock surfaces and natural discontinuities have been tested by Cawsey and Farrar (1976), Barton and Choubey (1977), Bruce et al (1988) and Cruden and Hu (1988). Hencher (1976) discussed advantages and limitations of <b>tilting</b> <b>tables.</b> Testing rocks in the laboratory using a <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> requires transportation of rock samples from the field and, generally, cutting of rock samples in the laboratory. Only a limited number of rock samples can be tested if the working site is far from a highway. Rock samples may be broken when they are sawn. In order to conduct as many tests as needed in the field, a portable <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> was designed by the author and built in the Department of Civil Engineering workshop at the University of Alberta. The <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> was used to test friction angles of bedding surfaces of sandstones in the Highwood Pass, Alberta. A report on the <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> is given here. The construction of the <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> and the test procedure are given first, followed by test examples of the rocks of Highwood Pass. Then a discussion of the testing results and the table itself is given...|$|R

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> driven by worm and worm wheel Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> driven by worm and worm wheel in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> system with <b>tilting</b> angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of worm and worm wheel, the torsional stiffness of worm wheel shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R

40|$|In screen-based experiences, {{the screen}} itself {{can become the}} {{physical}} device used for interaction. The “move-ability” of the screen affords interactivity between the screen artifact and the viewer, and between the virtual and physical spaces. We have created a movable screen interface, called the <b>tilting</b> <b>table,</b> which provides a display surface via overhead projection. This interface invites user interaction through the action of tilting the tabletop. The degree of tilt affects the displayed visuals and audio output. This simple interaction makes users feel they have a closer connection to the virtual imagery, and the screen thus blurs the boundary between them. In this paper, we introduce four applications that have been implemented for the <b>tilting</b> <b>table.</b> Two use an artistic approach to create expressive and entertaining media interactions, while two {{have been developed for}} navigating large information spaces.

50|$|A <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> {{test can}} be done in {{different}} ways and be modified for individual circumstances. In some cases, the patient will be strapped to a <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> lying flat and then tilted or suspended completely or almost completely upright (as if standing). Most of the time, the patient is suspended at an angle of 60 to 80 degrees. Sometimes, the patient will be given a drug, such as Glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) or isoproterenol, to create further susceptibility to the test. In all cases, the patient is instructed not to move. Symptoms, blood pressure, pulse, electrocardiogram, and sometimes blood oxygen saturation are recorded. The test either ends when the patient faints or develops other significant symptoms, or after a set period (usually from 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the facility or individualized protocol).|$|E
