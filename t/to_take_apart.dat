5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E
5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E

Since 2008, fifteen or sixteen members of Dublin City Council has spent the weeks in the build-up to the marathon testing water hydrants in the St Stephen's Green and Stillorgan Road areas to ensure they are working properly. On the morning of the race, they begin a process of laying out cables and attaching them to the hydrants. The cables also have to be covered and ramps have to be installed for the benefit of wheelchair users.

25|$|Deming's {{teachings and}} {{philosophy}} are clearly illustrated {{by examining the}} results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry, as the following example shows. Ford Motor Company was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in Japan and the United States. Soon after the car model was on the market, Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmission over the US-made transmission, and {{they were willing to}} wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmission. Finally, Ford engineers decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within specified tolerance levels. On the other hand, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch—then the Japanese parts were all within 1/16 of an inch, less variation. This made the Japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.|$|E
500|$|Filming of {{the episode}} started on August 29, 2003, {{overlapping}} with {{the final day of}} the shoot for the episode [...] "". As the final scenes to be shot for [...] "Exile" [...] only required Linda Park from the main cast, the remaining cast were freed up to shoot scenes for [...] "The Shipment". The first scenes to be filmed were those concerning the subplot {{of the episode}} where Tucker attempts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the Xindi rifle. Filming resumed on the day after Labor Day with all of the main cast involved. Most of the sets used were the Enterprise standing sets, but additional sets were required to represent Gralik's home, the Xindi complex and a forest and cave area. During the shoot, live footage was shot of the sets and was presented by Scott Bakula for Good Day Live in order to promote the series three premier [...] "The Xindi", which aired that evening.|$|E

The Foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes. [...] The Foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the [...] "Engineering Box", a box filled with activities for a school {{to use as a}} teaching aid. The Foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for Key Stage 4 and above. [...] The Engineering Box enables students <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of Genius of Britain, a Channel 4 TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.|$|E
2500|$|He is {{extremely}} talented in chess, as it requires both {{his father and}} brother to play against him and a distraction to defeat him. Charlie also has a vast understanding of theoretical physics, often assisting Larry with his multi-dimensional supergravity theory and papers on gravity waves, and biology, extending to knowledge of ciliate protozoa {{and the spread of}} infectious diseases. While brilliant in some areas, he is lacking in others. Dr. Fleinhardt has stated that it is a good thing he went into applied mathematics as opposed to engineering, as machines malfunction in his presence, though he was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> and rebuild his father's cell phone to analyze its GPS transceiver. He is apparently a bad speller (e.g., he misspells [...] "anomaly" [...] and [...] "conceited") and does not know the meaning of [...] "defenestration" [...] (for which Larry chastises him stating that the idealization is to be a Renaissance man and that even math and physics majors had to have a course on English).

2500|$|The railroad's charter gave it {{two years}} to be built. However, like the {{original}} plan for the line, numerous difficulties were encountered. One such issue was the acquisition of the necessary property for the line's right-of-way. Many property owners refused to sell their land, {{which was in the}} way of the proposed line. To prevent the loss of the line's charter, in 1853, the company successfully petitioned for an extension of two more years to build the line. A bill was passed in 1853 that gave the company the right to operate ferry service between New York and Staten Island. Still facing difficulties, in January 1855, the company applied to the New York State Legislature for a three-year extension to complete the project. After all of the property required for the right-of-way was completed, construction commenced in November 1855. However, after construction had started they had run out of money to complete the line. Therefore, they asked Cornelius [...] "Commodore" [...] Vanderbilt, the sole Staten Island-to-Manhattan ferry operator, for a loan. Vanderbilt agreed to finance the railroad, but he changed the northern terminal of line from Stapleton to his ferry landing further east, Vanderbilt's Landing. Vanderbilt tried to stop competitors who had previously owned the railroad's lease. Vanderbilt appointed James R. Robinson to build a structure to block his competitors, but on July 28, 1851, people tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>apart</b> the almost-finished structure, threatening to hurt Robinson if he tried to block them. In 1858, Cornelius's son William Vanderbilt was inducted onto the railway's board of directors.|$|E
