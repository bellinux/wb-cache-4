5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After <b>the</b> <b>blast,</b> Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive <b>the</b> <b>blast,</b> but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived <b>the</b> <b>blast</b> because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There are 220 kV super-voltage {{transmission}} lines and electrification line above <b>the</b> road-cut excavation <b>blasting</b> project, {{which is near}} <b>the</b> buildings, <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration and fly-rocks shall be strictly controlled, thus <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> design and construction are difficult. This paper describes <b>the</b> controllable <b>blasting</b> technology design of the road-cut excavation in the complex environment, <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> parameter selection, <b>the</b> detonating network and the safety technology. Practice has proved that <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> vibration and individual fly-rock can be controlled by the meticulous design and construction as well as reliable safety technology measures under the condition of no cover when urban road-cut excavation blasting is {{carried out in the}} complex environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To get optimum {{blasting}} parameter {{bringing out}} <b>the</b> best <b>blasting</b> outcome is {{very helpful to}} increase the speed and efficiency in tunnel-building. For this reason, <b>the</b> effect of <b>blasting</b> parameters on blasting outcome is analyzed based on that the rocks are complex and changeful through which the tunnel is driven {{and that there is a}} gap between blasting theory and <b>blasting</b> practice. <b>The</b> method helpful to get <b>the</b> optimum <b>blasting</b> parameters is present in which <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> outcome is measured, recorded and analyzed, and <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters are adjusted aiming at the specific tunnel according to <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> theory and <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> technician’s experience. <b>The</b> presented method is important and significant for improving the tunnel-building technique by <b>blasting,</b> realizing <b>the</b> high speed and efficiency of tunnel-building by blasting...|$|R

30|$|Due to this process, it is {{unavoidable}} that <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> particles induces abrasive pollution on the surface, {{giving rise to}} a surface modification {{not only in the}} final roughness but also in the chemical composition, that influences the physicochemical properties of <b>the</b> <b>blasted</b> surfaces [25]. To minimize the drastic changes produced by of <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> process, <b>the</b> posterior acid attack is usually used as a method to smooth titanium surfaces and also to eliminate the residual particles resulting from <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> process [26]. <b>The</b> use of HCl posterior to <b>the</b> <b>blasting</b> process does not assure that residual hydroxyapatite particles remain incrusted in the surface of the implants. Nevertheless, given the chemical nature of the Ca-P compounds on the surface, its presence could be even considered as beneficial in the osseointegration process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract.

5|$|The Sideling Hill Tunnel's {{original}} plans {{date back}} to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred {{at the end of the}} Sideling Hill Tunnel. <b>The</b> <b>blast,</b> which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in <b>the</b> <b>blast.</b> Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during <b>the</b> <b>blast,</b> that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began to inflate, and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.|$|E
