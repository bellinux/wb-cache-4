2500|$|Minor Threat {{broke up}} in 1983. A {{contributing}} factor was disagreement over musical direction. MacKaye was allegedly skipping practice sessions {{towards the end}} of the band's career, and he wrote the lyrics to the songs on the Salad Days EP in the studio. That was quite a contrast with the earlier recordings, as he had written and co-written the music for much of the band's early material. Minor Threat, which had returned to being a four-piece group with the departure of Hansgen, played its final show on September 23, 1983, at the Lansburgh Cultural Center in Washington, D.C., sharing the bill with go-go band Trouble Funk, and Austin, Texas, punk funk act <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boys.</b> In a meaningful way, Minor Threat ended their final set with [...] "Last Song", which was the original title of [...] "Salad Days".|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, Shoney's began {{launching}} {{restaurants in}} Florida and Kentucky, branded as [...] "Shoney's Towne and Country" [...] because Frisch's owned <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> rights in these states.

While these lawsuits failed, similar suits by Frisch's against Elby's complicated Elby's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> advertising in <b>the</b> upper Ohio Valley.

Also, several wrestlers credited ECW as the place where Austin developed his microphone skills. Austin has credited Heyman as the man who taught him how to cut a promo.

Whipwreck, who was the ECW World Heavyweight Champion at the time, defeated Austin at November to Remember. During this time, Austin learnt Whipwreck's finishing move, the Whipper-Snapper and would adopt it and popularize it in his later career as the Stunner. The Sandman defeated Austin and Whipwreck in a triple threat match at December to Dismember in 1995 for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.

In Houston, two pioneering radio programs in particular, Marilyn Mock's S Show on KTRU-FM and Perry Coma's The Funhouse Show on KPFT-FM, were instrumental in helping create the punk scene in that city, through band interviews and playing import-only records, as well as the flamboyant personalities of the DJs. Local punk zines like XLR8 and music weeklies such as Public News, and independent record outlets like Real Records, Record Rack, Record Exchange, and Vinal Edge not only scoured the world for punk and [...] "new wave" [...] sounds, but they hosted in-store concerts where fans could meet the artists. The punk scene flourished in the early 1980s, led by the Skunks, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Boys,</b> The Dicks, MDC, Really Red, The Degenerates, Mydolls, The Hates, The Judy's, the Volumatix, DRI, Sik Mentality, the Killerwatts and Culturcide; so did the scene in Dallas, with groups such as The Telefones, NCM, Bobby Soxx & the Teenage Queers, Bomb Squad, The Hugh Beaumont Experience and Stick Men with Ray Guns. Some notable Houston clubs were the Island, Cabaret Voltaire (a punk rock club in the warehouse district of downtown), the Apocalypse Monster Club (in the Clear Lake area near NASA), the Axiom (in one of the old Cabaret Voltaire locations), Fitzgerald's, The Abyss, and Numbers (a predominantly new wave club). In the mid-1990s, post-punk act At the Drive-In formed in El Paso, along with its two offshoots, Sparta and The Mars Volta.
