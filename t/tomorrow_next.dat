5000|$|Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, the band's second album, was {{released}} in September 1989. The greater vocal contribution by Einar Örn on the record was criticized {{in many of the}} record's reviews, which were noticeably weaker than those for Life's Too Good. Not all critics agreed that it was worse than their debut album, though. Robert Christgau rated it a B+, higher than the B- he gave Life's Too Good. The singles [...] "Regina" [...] and [...] "Planet" [...] topped the UK indie charts but fared poorly in the mainstream charts outside of Iceland. After the release of Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, the band embarked on a lengthy international tour. At the end of the tour, they started to ponder about splitting up and went on a hiatus.|$|E

Making science more central to society can enrich every level of it from giving children the curiosity bug to creating <b>tomorrow’s</b> <b>next</b> world changing idea.

50|$|The Video is a {{music video}} {{compilation}} released in VHS format by the Icelandic band The Sugarcubes, whose most famous member is the renowned singer Björk. This video came into market in 1990 and contains nine {{songs from the}} 1987 album Life's Too Good and the 1989 album Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the tour in late 1990, the band members pursued their own individual interests. Stick Around for Joy, the bands third and final album, was released in February 1992. It received noticeably better reviews than Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, and spawned the bands first big hit single, the aptly titled [...] "Hit". Further singles [...] "Walkabout" [...] and [...] "Vitamin" [...] failed to make any chart impact. The Sugarcubes opened for U2 during the US leg of their Zoo TV Tour in October and November 1992, playing to a grand total of 700,000 people.|$|E
50|$|Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week! is {{the second}} studio album by Icelandic {{alternative}} rock band The Sugarcubes, released in September 1989 through Elektra Records. A version of the album sung in Icelandic titled Illur Arfur! (English: Bad Legacy!) was released as well, with the same English track listing, {{under the name of}} Sykurmolarnir (The Sugarcubes in Icelandic). The album reached #70 on the Billboard 200, #15 on the UK Albums Chart and #1 on the UK Indie Albums chart. The album wasn't as well received by critics as their critically acclaimed debut album, Life's Too Good, and was criticized for Einar's greater vocal contribution.|$|E

After the band split in 1992, Barnacle contributed to Björk's first two solo albums, Debut, released in 1993 and Post, released in 1995. In 1989 he also participated to the releases of Bass! by Simon Harris, The Beautiful South's debut album {{as well as their}} second album, Choke, released in 1990, Hard Reyne by Australian singer and songwriter James Reyne, Bankstatement, a solo project by Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks, Waterfront by Waterfront, and I'm Still Here by Eartha Kitt.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{received}} {{critical and}} popular acclaim internationally. Their debut studio album, Life's Too Good, {{was released in}} April 1988 to unexpected international success. It is credited as the first Icelandic album to have a worldwide impact and is considered a definite influence on all subsequent Icelandic popular music. It spanned the band's signature hit [...] "Birthday". Their follow-up album, Here Today, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Next</b> Week!, was released in September 1989 to lukewarm reviews from some critics and fans. Critic Robert Christgau rated it higher than their debut, with a B+. Their third and final album, Stick Around for Joy, released in February 1992, was more well received by both fans and critics and had two successful singles: [...] "Hit" [...] and [...] "Leash Called Love." [...] The Sugarcubes have been regarded as [...] "the biggest rock band to emerge from Iceland." ...|$|E
50|$|Crises abound. First, Schultz {{comes for}} his money. Jenny keeps him from seeing Olaf, who {{knows nothing about}} Tom's debt, and {{promises}} to pay him <b>tomorrow.</b> <b>Next,</b> Dennis injures a man while driving; Sylvia is a passenger and gives her name as Jenny Swanson to avoid scandal. She asks Jenny to play along, so Jenny demands $5000 to do it. That takes care of Tom's IOUs. When she learns that Paul and Caroline plan to elope, Jenny arranges it so that Caroline learns the truth: that Paul is only after her wealth. Then, Olaf announces Tom and Jenny's engagement at his party. Finally, an attorney representing the injured man barges in to speak to Olaf, followed a little later by the Daytons, who have their own quarrel with Olaf. Olaf gathers his family together {{to figure out what}} is going on. Eventually, everything is straightened out: Caroline gets Dennis, and Brooke gets Jenny.|$|E

5000|$|Extreme {{programming}} encourages {{starting with}} the simplest solution. Extra functionality can then be added later. The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding {{for the needs of}} today instead of those of <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>next</b> week, or next month. This is sometimes summed up as the [...] "You aren't gonna need it" [...] (YAGNI) approach. Proponents of XP acknowledge the disadvantage that this can sometimes entail more effort tomorrow to change the system; their claim is that this is more than compensated for by the advantage of not investing in possible future requirements that might change before they become relevant. Coding and designing for uncertain future requirements implies the risk of spending resources on something that might not be needed, while perhaps delaying crucial features. Related to the [...] "communication" [...] value, simplicity in design and coding should improve the quality of communication. A simple design with very simple code could be easily understood by most programmers in the team.|$|E
5000|$|Kenshin {{is unable}} to {{understand}} what is missing in himself, and so engages in another duel with Master Hiko. He learns that he had thrown away his will to live during his time as the assassin Battousai, and as {{he has no intention of}} coming out alive he will be unable to defeat Shishio. Hiko points out that he has lost his killer instinct with his oath to not kill and his [...] "ridiculous" [...] sword, after all it is the strong who survive and the weak who die. That night, Hiko says that something is missing in Kenshin, and that he will be given the night to think about it. If he cannot find what it is, he will die <b>tomorrow.</b> <b>Next</b> morning Hiko reveals his final task as Master to Kenshin - without realising what is missing, Kenshin will return to his old ways and so Hiko has to kill Battousai. Kenshin listens as he is told that he cannot learn the secret until he realises that the will to live is paramount; and so he has learned the secret of Amakakeru.|$|E
5000|$|Computer-aided {{manufacturing}} (CAM) Interactive {{analysis and}} engineering. Today nearly {{all aspects of}} power plant simulation require extensive off-line setup, calculation, and iteration. The time required for each iteration can range {{from one day to}} several weeks. Tools for interactive collaborative engineering in which the engineer can establish a dynamic thinking process are needed to permit real-time exploration of the “what-if” questions that are essential to the engineering process. In nearly all circumstances, an engineering answer now has much greater value than an answer <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>next</b> week, or next month. Although many excellent engineering analysis techniques have been developed, they are not routinely used as a fundamental part of engineering design, operations, control, and maintenance. The time required to set up, compute, and understand the result, then repeat the process until an adequate answer is obtained, significantly exceeds the time available. This includes techniques such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite elements analysis (FEA), and optimization of complex systems. Instead, these engineering tools are used to provide limited insight to the problem, to sharpen an answer, or to understand what went wrong after a bad design and how to improve the results next time. This is particularly true of CFD analysis.|$|E
