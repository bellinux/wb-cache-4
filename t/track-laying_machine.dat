On Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 24, 1904, Holt successfully tested the first workable <b>track-laying</b> <b>machine,</b> plowing soggy San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland.

2500|$|The {{preferred}} {{process of}} {{flash butt welding}} involves an automated <b>track-laying</b> <b>machine</b> running a strong electrical current through the touching ends of two unjoined pieces of rail. The ends become white hot due to electrical resistance and are then pressed together forming a strong weld. Thermite welding is used to repair or splice together existing CWR segments. [...] This is a manual process requiring a reaction crucible and form to contain the molten iron. Thermite-bonded joints are seen as less reliable and more prone to fracture or break.|$|E

40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the {{characteristics}} of crawler track of track assembly, the ground pressure of assembly, the process of rut-forming, the properties of ground, the weight characteristics of <b>Track-Laying</b> Skidding <b>Machine</b> (TLSM). The purpose is to rise the support trafficability of TLSM on the development basis and on the improvement basis of design method of coupling of track assembly with the superhumidifyed grounds. The die tests have been performed. The determination technique of support indicators of TLSM trafficability has been developed, the change mechanisms of length of active-support sections of crawler track {{with regard to the}} change of physical-mechanical indicators of ground and of assembly construction have been determined. The application package and the pneumo-track assembly of TLSM have been developed. The technique is used in the Central Research Design Institute of Mechanization and of Power-Engineering in Timber Industry. The introduction efficiencies are the reduction of rut 3 times, the decrease of resistance coefficient against the motion by 26 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

40|$|Part of collection: Alice Springs to Darwin Railway construction, Northern Territory, 1 - 6 August, 2002.; Title {{supplied}} by photographer.; Also available in an electronic version via the Internet at: [URL] "Tracklaying train laying track south of Tennant Creek, 457 km north of Alice Springs. Concept of tracklaying: As the sleeper and rail wagons arrive behind the <b>track-laying</b> <b>machine,</b> two gantry cranes run back and collect the sleepers, which are dropped at 720 mm intervals {{on the bare}} earth embankment. The rail is simultaneously fed from the wagon outriggers on to the sleepers. Pulling this contraption is a Caterpillar 973 Traxcavator- basically, a bulldozer. The bulldozer moves all day at a constant pace, there is 20 mm room for error, faster or slower and the sleepers won't fall at the right spacing. The driver keeps everything deadstraight by watching a pegged-out centerline through a TV screen in his cab. 1. 4 km track is laid a day.
