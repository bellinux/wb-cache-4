40|$|Abstract No. 165 Modularity is a {{new product}} {{development}} strategy in which interfaces shared among components in a given product architecture become specified and standardized to allow for greater substitutability of components across product families. This paper introduces a mathematical model, termed modularization function, for analyzing the degree of modularity in a given product architecture by {{taking into account the}} following variables: number of components, number of interfaces, and substitutability factor of a given product architecture. It is assumed that the degree of modularity in a given product architecture is constraint by the composition of its components (number of standard and new-to-the-firm components), interfaces shared among the components, and degree of substitutability. The application of the modularization function is illustrated with two distinct sets of product architectures: Chrysler Jeeps windshield wipers controllers and transmission systems of Schindler elevators. The analysis of the Chrysler case shows that the silent-relay architecture achieved higher opportunities for modularization than the solid-state architecture due to the higher substitutability level and lower new-to-firm component composition. In the Schindler case, on the other hand, the comparative analysis of two different <b>transmission</b> <b>subsystems</b> captures the sensitivity and dynamics of product architecture modularity created by three types of components (standard, neutral, and unique) and two types of interfaces (fundamental and optional). Some managerial implications for both case studies are also discussed based on the application of modularization function. 1 1...|$|R

In an effort to increase efficiency in use of high performance and heavy-duty systems, especially in power generation and <b>transmission</b> <b>subsystems,</b> Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) has emerged as an improvement over more costly time/use maintenance practices.

40|$|Ultimately {{the design}} of a digital {{communication}} system depends on the properties of the channel. The channel is typically a part of the digital communication system that we cannot change. Some channels are simply a physical medium, such as a wire pair or optical fiber. On the other hand, the radio channel is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is divided by government regulatory bodies into bandlimited radio channels that occupy disjoint frequency bands. In this book we do not consider {{the design of}} the transducers, such as antennas, lasers, and photodetectors, and hence we consider them part of the channel. Some channels, notably the telephone channel, are actually composites of multiple <b>transmission</b> <b>subsystems.</b> Such composite channels derive their characteristics from the properties of the underlying subsystems. Section 18. 1 discusses composite channels. Sections 18. 2 through 18. 4 review the characteristics of the most common channels used for digital communication, including the transmission line (wire pair or coaxial cable), optical fiber, and microwave radio (satellite, point-to-point and mobile terrestrial radio).

40|$|Tradeoff {{studies are}} a common part of {{engineering}} practice. Designers conduct tradeoff studies {{in order to improve}} their understanding of how various design considerations relate to one another. Generally a tradeoff study involves a systematic multi-criteria evaluation of various alternatives for a particular system or subsystem. After evaluating these alternatives, designers eliminate those that perform poorly under the given criteria and explore more carefully those that remain. The capability to compose preexisting tradeoff studies is advantageous to the designers of engineered systems, such as aircraft, military equipment, and automobiles. Such systems are comprised of many subsystems for which prior tradeoff studies may exist. System designers conceivably could explore system-level tradeoffs more quickly by leveraging this knowledge. For example, automotive systems engineers could combine tradeoff studies from the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>subsystems</b> quickly to produce a comprehensive tradeoff study for the power train. This level of knowledge reuse is in keeping with good systems engineering practice. However, existing procedures for generating tradeoff studies under uncertainty involve assumptions that preclude engineers from composing them in a mathematically rigorous way. In uncertain problems, designers can eliminate inferior alternatives using stochastic dominance, which compares the probability distributions defined in the design criteria space. Although this is well-founded mathematically, the procedure can be computationally expensive because it typically entails a sampling-based uncertainty propagation method for each alternative being considered. This thesis describes two novel extensions that permit engineers to compose preexisting subsystem-level tradeoff studies under uncertainty into mathematically valid system-level tradeoff studies and efficiently eliminate inferior alternatives through intelligent sampling. The approaches are based on three key ideas: the use of stochastic dominance methods to enable the tradeoff evaluation when the design criteria are uncertain, the use of parameterized efficient sets to enable reuse and composition of subsystem-level tradeoff studies, and the use of statistical tests in dominance testing {{to reduce the number of}} behavioral model evaluations. The approaches are demonstrated in the context of a tradeoff study for a motor vehicle...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} {{efficiency of the}} electric energy system depends {{not only on the}} performance of the electric generation and <b>transmission</b> <b>subsystems,</b> but also on the ability to produce and transport the various forms of primary energy, particularly coal and natural gas. However, electric power systems have traditionally been developed and operated without a conscious awareness of the energy system-wide implications, namely the consideration of the integrated dynamics with the fuel markets and infrastructures. This has been partly due to the difficulty of formulating models capable of analyzing the large-scale, complex, time-dependent, and highly interconnected behavior of the integrated energy system. In this dissertation, a novel approach for studying the movements of coal, natural gas, and electricity in an integrated fashion is presented. Conceptually, the model developed is a simplified representation of the national infrastructures, structured as a generalized, multiperiod network composed of nodes and arcs. Under this formulation, fuel supply and electricity demand nodes are connected via a transportation network and the model is solved for the most efficient allocation of quantities and corresponding prices for the mutual benefits of all. The synergistic action of economic, physical, and environmental constraints produces the optimal pattern of energy flows. Key data elements are derived from various publicly available sources, including publications from the Energy Information Administration, survey forms administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and databases maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency. The results of different test cases are analyzed to demonstrate that the decentralized level of decision-making combined with imperfect competition may be preventing the realization of potential cost savings. An overall optimization at the national level shows that there are opportunities to better utilize low cost generators, curtailing usage of higher cost units and increasing electric power trade, which would ultimately allow customers to benefit from lower electricity prices. In summary, the model developed is a simulation tool that helps build {{a better understanding of the}} complex dynamics and interdependencies of the coal, natural gas, and electricity networks. It enables public and private decision makers to carry out comprehensive analyses of a wide range of issues related to the energy sector, such as strategic planning, economic impact assessment, and the effects of different regulatory regimes...|$|R

The conductance of the monolayer junction with a chemisorbed top contact is higher in trans configuration, {{in agreement with the}} previous theoretical predictions of one-dimensional single molecule junctions. However, with a physisorbed top contact, the "ON" state with larger conductance is associated with the cis configuration due to a reduced effective tunneling pathway by switching from trans to cis, which successfully explains recently experimental measurements of azobenzene monolayer junctions. A simple model is developed to explain electron <b>transmission</b> across <b>subsystems</b> in the molecular junction.
