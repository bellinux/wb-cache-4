[...] Jake Rosenberg of Transcending the Mundane stated that on Office of Strategic Influence, [...] "it sounded like they were experimenting with different approaches, but never really established the OSI sound". He lauded Free for [...] " [...] like {{the work of a}} mature and confident band".

[...] Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Road Trip" [...] was less funny than [...] "The Fight", and that the Know Ya Boo subplot [...] "fizzled a bit". But he called it a [...] "sweet episode" [...] for its developments with Leslie and Ben, and said Ron and Chris were especially funny in their scenes. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said [...] "Road Trip" [...] was [...] "pretty great" [...] but less funny than the previous episode, [...] "The Fight". She praised the Ron subplot, but said Tom's game show was [...] "much more predictable and rote".|$|E

500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>another.</b> Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What do you want me to say? Everybody thinks he has the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E
500|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since the 2010 season, the Nittany Lions looked {{to achieve their}} fourth {{consecutive}} win in the series, however even a hometown paper, the York Daily Record, predicted the Lions would lose, albeit in a close game, citing Michigan's superiority on both offense and defense, as well as coaching, compared to Penn State's superiority on special teams and intangibles. [...] Penn State's edition of SB Nation also predicted the Lions would lose citing the Wolverines' better athletes, but noted that Michigan's quarterback Devin Gardner has thrown as many interceptions as touchdowns (8) coming into the game, and that Penn State's best chance to win would be if Michigan turned the ball over frequently. Coming off an embarrassing loss against Indiana, Penn State's coach Bill O'Brien was [...] "focused" [...] all week and {{refused to talk to}} the media about the prior week's loss, focusing strictly on the Michigan game, which was Homecoming for Penn State, was expected to be the first sellout of the season, and featured a whiteout, led by the student section. O'Brien noted, [...] "it would be crazy to think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> game". The game was Penn State's second national broadcast of the year, with Penn State alumnus Matt Millen providing color commentary on Penn State's homecoming weekend. Michigan, coming off a 42–13 victory over Minnesota, entered the game with a win-loss record of 5–0, one of two remaining undefeated teams in the Big Ten (the other was Ohio State, who was 6–0, and whom the Lions are scheduled to play on October 26). Michigan's defense, led by their star cornerback Blake Countless, who was tied for the NCAA lead with four interceptions entering the game, had yet to allow a rushing touchdown, and was expected to receive a boost from the return of their 2012 All-Big Ten linebacker Jake Ryan, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) the prior season. As such, a key for Penn State was to match Michigan's physicality in strong offensive line play and establish the line of scrimmage, both on offense and defense, as the game would be won in the trenches. The game was described as a [...] "critical juncture". Before the game, Penn State realized that, due to a Ticketmaster glitch, it had oversold student section tickets, and was forced to offer several alternate packages in order not to have to boot students.|$|E
