25|$|Vespers {{begins with}} the singing or {{chanting}} of the opening versicles Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Alleluia. (O God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make haste <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As {{it was in the}} beginning, both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia.) From Septuagesima until Easter, Laus tibi Domine, Rex aeternae gloriae (Praise be to Thee O Lord, King of eternal glory) replaces Alleluia.|$|E
25|$|Through Cambridge and Bloomsbury, Young had {{a longstanding}} {{friendship}} with E.M. Forster. Suffering writer’s block {{while working on}} A Passage to India, the novelist was Young’s guest at the Lacket in early May 1922. Shortly afterwards he wrote to Young declaring, “an unfinished novel’s before me now, and sometimes I work at it with distaste and despair…You certainly have done more than any individual I know <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> by direct remarks. Your knowledge {{of the business of}} creating seemed to me profounder than that possessed by so-called artists.” These comments suggest that Young gave Forster significant advice and encouragement at a crucial stage on work on the latter’s eventual masterpiece.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{tie them}} up," [...] protested the man. [...] "I didn't know 'ow {{to tie the}} beastly nags up, {{and there was no}} one <b>to</b> <b>'elp</b> <b>me.</b> I didn't think they'd walk out like that." ...|$|R

500|$|Woods overcame {{difficulties}} with stuttering as a boy. This {{was not known}} until {{he wrote a letter}} to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, [...] "I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a class for two years <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> and I finally learned to stop." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 1974 season, Bell {{rushed for}} 1048yards which was, at that time, the third highest single-season total in school history. [...] He joined Ron Johnson and Billy Taylor {{as the only}} players in Michigan history to rush for 1,000yards in a season. [...] Bell {{accomplished}} the feat despite being a part-time player, sharing the starting tailback job with sophomore Rob Lytle. [...] In the 1974 campaign, Lytle started eight games to Bell's three, [...] although Bell outrushed Lytle 1048yards to 802. [...] Bell had lost about [...] in the summer before the 1974 season, dropping to [...] [...] He said, [...] "I did {{it on my own}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> run, to make me quicker." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbery {{incorporates}} several themes {{into the}} novel. References to philosophy, for instance, abound throughout, getting increasingly dense {{as the story}} progresses. Barbery confesses to having [...] "followed a long, boring course of studies in philosophy", and comments that [...] "I expected it <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> understand better that which surrounds me: but it didn't work out that way. Literature has taught me more. I was interested in exploring the bearing philosophy could really have on one's life, and how. I wanted to illuminate this process. That's where the desire to anchor philosophy to a story, a work of fiction, was born: to give it more meaning, make it more physically real, and render it, perhaps, even entertaining." ...|$|E

I've 'ad to {{run against}} you pretty hard in the way o' business, now and then, but I will say that outside o' business--bounds an' smokin', an' such like--I don't wish {{to have a more}} {{trustworthy}} young gentleman <b>to</b> <b>'elp</b> <b>me</b> out of a hole. The way you 'andled the drill was beautiful, though I say it. Now, if you come regular henceforward--" ...|$|R
500|$|The stunt {{coordinator}} for the season was Tanner Gill. In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying [...] "I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level. That {{has to be very}} believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{still do}} not have a {{national}} memorial in Washington, D.C. to honor the Americans who sacrificed with their lives during World War I. On this eve of Veterans Day, I call upon the American people and the world <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> in asking our elected officials to pass the law for a memorial to World War I in our nation's capital. These are difficult times, and we are not asking for anything elaborate. What is fitting and right is a memorial that can take its place among those commemorating the other great conflicts of the past century. On this 92nd anniversary of the armistice, it is time to move forward with honor, gratitude, and resolve." ...|$|E
500|$|Ali Suliman, who {{previously}} collaborated with Berg on the 2007 film The Kingdom, plays Mohammad Gulab, an Afghan villager; Alexander Ludwig plays Navy SEAL Machinist's Mate Shane Patton. Marcus Luttrell {{appears in the}} film in an uncredited role. He first appears as a SEAL teammate who lightheartedly hazes Patton, then during a briefing scene where he is seen shaking his head when the Rules of Engagement are being explained, and later {{as one of the}} servicemen who perishes when a CH-47 Chinook is shot down. Luttrell said of the latter scene, [...] "I {{was on the other side}} of the mountain when those guys came <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> so getting to die on the helicopter in the movie was a very powerful moment for me." ...|$|E

I would also like to share my deepest thanks with Sarah Vidal, PhD Candidate.

500|$|... "Hello Kitty" [...] is a J-pop, dubstep, and EDM {{track that}} is three minutes and {{eighteen}} seconds long. [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] {{was written by}} Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeger and Hodges. Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman became assistants in its production. The song was engineered by John Hanes, musical mixed by Serban Ghenea and additional programming was held by Paddock and Moorman. Lavigne described the lyrics while talking to Digital Spy, [...] "'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really exciting for me. I didn't want it to sound like anything I'd done before. I wanted it to sound over the top so I ended up hiring a new producer <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite a {{perceived}} decline in his work's quality, the 1840s {{were the most}} financially successful of Etty's career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty {{was in a position}} to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that [...] "being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my Firm Intention NEVER TO MARRY. In which resolution I pray GOD <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> that I may devote myself purely to my Art, my Country, and my GOD!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{remains of}} the crew members of HH-53C Jolly Roger 67—Chapman, Call, Avery, Prater, and Pearson, and Alley—were {{returned}} to the United States on October 1, 1997. The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present. He told {{the families of the}} downed fliers that [...] "Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get out of the jungles of Vietnam. You have my deepest sympathy—you and these six brave men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, Captain Maryon," [...] says Pordage, in a {{tremendous}} passion. [...] "Very good, sir. Be the consequences {{on your own}} head! Mr. Kitten, as it has come <b>to</b> this, <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on with it." ...|$|R

500|$|Following the 1988 season, the Orioles again named Ripken their third-base coach. Speaking at the Annual Ripken Fan Club Banquet, {{general manager}} Roland Hemond said, [...] " [...] {{was a tough}} year for the Orioles, a tough year for me, and a tough year for the Ripken family. There {{was a lot of}} trauma, and I {{respected}} them for the way they handled it. I will never forget it." [...] Brady Anderson, who would play for the Orioles from 1988 through 2001 and hit 50 home runs in 1996, credited Ripken for helping him make it with the Orioles: [...] "I'll never forget earlier in my career how Cal Sr. stayed with me, trying <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> become a better player when it might not have been the fashionable thing to do within the organization." [...] Ripken remained with the team until after the 1992 season, when he was removed from third-base coach duties as the Orioles wished to give younger coaches opportunities. The Orioles offered him the brand new position of coordinator of minor league field operations, but he declined, disappointed at being removed from third base. Ripken maintained that he was not retired, but he would never coach professionally again.|$|E
500|$|Roughly a {{year into}} development, the team {{discovered}} that their second producer—the first having quit Origin {{near the beginning of}} development—had left the project. Neurath later said that [...] "neither [...] had much involvement" [...] in the game, and that, following the second's departure, the team spent time without any producer at all. Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue, assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as [...] "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, [...] "Warren understood immediately {{what we were trying to}} accomplish with the game, and became our biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure Ultima Underworld would have ever seen the light of day." [...] Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and [...] "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game. He explained that Spector [...] "had that ability <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> and the rest of the guys reset, from the big-picture view of someone who has done it before." ...|$|E

When {{a member of the}} United States Senate brought in a friend to ask a favor, Holloway appealed to the senator's better nature: [...] "I look to you, Senator, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> maintain my probity." [...] Said Holloway later, [...] "No Congressman ever failed to react to such a plea." ...|$|E
