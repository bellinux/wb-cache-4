5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season in good form and equalled Nottingham Forest's unbeaten league run of 42 matches against Middlesbrough. The team set a new English {{division}} record and went a further seven games unbeaten before losing to Manchester United in controversial circumstances. Arsenal's form suffered as a result and defensive shortcomings became more apparent; two draws and a defeat in November reinforced Chelsea's position {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>where</b> they remained {{for the rest of the}} season. At home to Crystal Palace in February 2005, Wenger named an Arsenal squad with no English players – a first in the club's history which attracted criticism from the media. The team ended the season strongly, with a run of eight wins from nine games ensuring a second-place finish. 32 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 15 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer was Thierry Henry, who scored 30 goals in 42 games.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk to the end of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>where</b> Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

500|$|McEwan {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a novel about the 1970s, a {{formative}} period in his life he refers to as [...] "the time of my life." [...] For the United Kingdom it was a turbulent period, with striking miners, energy crisis, escalation of the conflict over Northern Ireland, repeated states of emergency and several shifts of government. It was also the period of the Cold War, when Western governments were trying to win the war of ideas against a highly radicalised intelligentsia. Operation Sweet Tooth is entirely fictional, but the story is inspired by the actual scandal affecting the conservative literary magazine Encounter, which in 1967 was revealed to have received covert funding from the CIA. McEwan uses this back-story to explore the relationship between artist and government, and the need for literature to remain independent. According to McEwan, the problem was not the anti-Communist crusade itself, but the secrecy with which it was conducted. [...] "All that's really required is that anything the state does in relation to the arts is laid on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>where</b> we can see it." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruthenium {{has four}} crystal {{modifications}} {{and does not}} tarnish unless subject to high temperatures. Ruthenium dissolves in fused alkalis to give ruthenates (...) , is not attacked by acids (even aqua regia) but is attacked by halogens at high temperatures. Indeed, ruthenium is most readily attacked by oxidizing agents. Small amounts of ruthenium can increase the hardness of platinum and palladium. The corrosion resistance of titanium is increased markedly {{by the addition of}} a small amount of ruthenium. The metal can be plated by electroplating and by thermal decomposition. A ruthenium-molybdenum alloy is known to be superconductive at temperatures below 10.6 K. Ruthenium is the last of the 4d transition metals that can assume the group oxidation state +8, and even then it is less stable there than the heavier congener osmium: this is the first group from the left of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>where</b> the second and third-row transition metals display notable differences in chemical behavior. Like iron but unlike osmium, ruthenium can form aqueous cations in its lower oxidation states of +2 and +3.|$|E

2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise <b>the</b> <b>table</b> (<b>where</b> the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E

2500|$|A massé is {{performed}} by hitting the cue ball with {{the butt of}} the cue stick elevated; usually by 60 degrees or more. While controlling the aim, speed and curve of the cue ball takes a great deal of practice to master, there is a science to it. [...] After the initial contact, the cue ball will travel straight along the path defined by the horizontal alignment of the cue until the cue ball slows enough for the imparted vertical spin to take over. [...] The cue ball will then curve onto a line defined by an angle described by the cue ball's initial resting point on the table and point on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>where</b> the cue tip was aimed. [...] The time before vertical spin overcomes horizontal movement is determined by the force with which the cue ball is struck. [...] Massés are quite difficult for non-experts, and are not allowed in some venues, as the table's [...] can be easily damaged by unskilled players.|$|E

All three were popular athletes. Klebold tried to pull Shoels {{out from under the}} table. He called to Harris, referring to him by his online identity and shouting, [...] "REB! There's a nigger over here!" [...] Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, Klebold and Harris taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. Harris knelt down and shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also knelt down and opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; [...] "Who's ready to die next?". Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death.

Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>where</b> Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E
