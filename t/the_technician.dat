5|$|A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was {{eaten by}} miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. <b>The</b> <b>technician</b> {{who did the}} {{research}} and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included {{a wide variety of}} locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.|$|E

5|$|Agatha is {{reconnected}} to the PreCrime system. While {{attempting to}} comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A new report is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. <b>The</b> <b>technician</b> informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{contamination}}, product {{contamination and}} technicians exposure were measured following preparation of iv bags with cyclophosphamide using the robotic system CytoCare. Wipe samples were taken inside CytoCare, {{in the clean}} room environment, from vials, and prepared iv bags including ports and analysed for contamination with cyclophosphamide. Contamination with cyclophosphamide was also measured in environmental air and on <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> hands and gloves used for handling the drugs. Exposure of <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> to cyclophosphamide was measured by analysis of cyclophosphamide in urine. Contamination with cyclophosphamide was mainly observed inside CytoCare, before preparation, after preparation and after daily routine cleaning. Contamination outside CytoCare was incidentally found. All vials with reconstituted cyclophosphamide entering CytoCare were contaminated on the outside but vials with powdered cyclophosphamide were not contaminated on the outside. Contaminated bags entering CytoCare were also contaminated after preparation but non-contaminated bags were not contaminated after preparation. Cyclophosphamide was detected on the ports of all prepared bags. Almost all outer pairs of gloves used for preparation and daily routine cleaning were contaminated with cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide was not found on the inner pairs of gloves and on the hands of <b>the</b> <b>technicians.</b> Cyclophosphamide was not detected in the stationary and personal air samples and in the urine samples of <b>the</b> <b>technicians.</b> CytoCare enables <b>the</b> preparation of cyclophosphamide {{with low levels of}} environmental contamination and product contamination and no measurable exposure of <b>the</b> <b>technicians...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Technician</b> license, {{newly created}} in the 1951 {{structure}} decision, was awarded to applicants who passed the General Class theory test, known as Element 3, but only required a 5 WPM code proficiency. It was initially intended for radio control of model aircraft, etc. but at that time, usage of the band for such a purpose was rare. Technicians were granted all General Class privileges in the 50MHz band and all bands above 220MHz; on 2 meters they were limited to 145–147MHz. An applicant was permitted to apply for and hold both Technician and Novice licenses simultaneously (for the first year). In the 1950s and until the late 1960s, a US ham could hold both Technician and Novice licenses at the same time, thus having two callsigns (WN 2x3 for the Novice and a WA or WB 2x3 for Technician).|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{model was}} solved using pre-emptive goal programming approach. This {{enabled us to}} determine the bounds for the objective functions. We considered the technicians’ earned-valued goal as being a higher priority than the technicians’ reliability goal. However, some organisations may consider the technicians’ reliability goal as being a higher priority than the technicians’ earned-valued goal. To address priority determination, priority scored performance measurement can be used (Tarokh and Nazemi 2006). The minimum value of the expected reliability of <b>the</b> total scheduled <b>technicians</b> was 85  %. During the testing of the proposed model, the minimum acceptable reliability of <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> was 60  %. The maximum acceptable reliability of <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> was 95  %.|$|R
