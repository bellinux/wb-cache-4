5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} {{the impacts of}} the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as {{in the case of}} NMPs). As a result, the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative voices in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during decompression, and <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly {{by the number of}} compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was {{to destroy the}} enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.
