5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs <b>too</b> <b>frequently,</b> plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead <b>too</b> <b>frequently,</b> their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E
5|$|Holloman {{finished}} the 1953 season with Toronto, {{and had a}} 4–3 record in 13 games. In 1954, Holloman's last professional season, he spent time on five different minor league squads, including former stops Toronto and Augusta, before retiring. The retirement was partially due to a sore arm, the result of pitching <b>too</b> <b>frequently</b> while playing winter ball. After retiring, Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency, {{and served as a}} scout for the Baltimore Orioles. He also turned to drinking for many years, but was able to overcome the addiction. He died on May 1, 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens, Georgia of a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and <b>too</b> <b>frequently.</b> I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories <b>too</b> <b>frequently.</b> The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E

They include suicide, decreased breathing, {{and an increased}} risk of seizures if used <b>too</b> <b>frequently</b> in those with epilepsy. Occasionally excitement or agitation may occur. Long term use can result in tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous.

25|$|During {{the fourteenth}} century there were several visitations. There is no notice of any by Bishop Dalderby; but he {{commissioned}} the prior of Dunstable in 1315 to visit the nuns of St. Giles-in-the-Wood in his name. Bishop Burghersh in 1322 wrote to order the prior and convent to take back a brother {{who had been on}} a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and asserted that he did so with the permission of his superior; and a little later the prior was cited for refusing to obey this injunction. In 1359 Bishop Gynwell, passing by the priory, noticed 'certain insolences and unlawful wanderings' of the canons, and wrote to reinforce the rule that none should go beyond the precincts of the monastery without reasonable cause, nor without the permission of the prior; and ordered further that such permission should not be <b>too</b> <b>frequently</b> given. He also reminded them of the rule that none should eat or drink outside the monastery, or talk with seculars without permission.|$|E
25|$|On the XVIII Corps front at the Battle of Langemarck, the machine-gunners of German blockhouses and pillbox {{outposts}} of the Wilhelmstellung, with British {{names like}} Hillock Farm, Maison du Hibou, Triangle Farm and the Cockcroft, had shot down the infantry of the 48th (South Midland) Division and 11th (Northern) Division {{well short of}} their objectives. At a conference with the Fifth Army corps commanders on 17 August, Gough complained that troops had failed to hold captured ground and considered court-martialling some NCOs and officers. Gough also thought that divisions had been relieved <b>too</b> <b>frequently,</b> which had exhausted fresh divisions before the attack. The corps commanders were asked for proposals for attacks to reach the final objectives where their divisions had fallen short on 16 August. Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob (II Corps) wanted to attack the brown line and then the yellow line, Lieutenant-General Herbert Watts (XIX Corps) wanted to attack the purple line but Maxse (XVIII Corps) preferred to attack the dotted purple line, ready to attack the yellow line with XIX Corps. The attacks were intended to reach good jumping off points for an attack by II, XIX and XVIII corps on 25 August but attacking in different places at different times, risked defeat in detail. Infantry tactics would also be irrelevant if the artillery insufficiently suppressed the German defenders while the infantry had to struggle through mud and waterlogged shell-holes. During the conference, another 48th Division attack on Maison du Hibou failed.|$|E
