40|$|There is {{significant}} room for improving users ’ experiences with model checking tools. An error trace {{produced by a}} model checker can be lengthy and is indicative of a symptom of an error. As a result, users can spend considerable time examining an error trace {{in order to understand}} the cause of the error. Moreover, even state-of-the-art model check-ers provide an experience akin to that provided by parsers before syntactic error recovery was invented: they report a single error trace per run. The user has to fix the error and run the model checker again to find more error traces. We present an algorithm that exploits the existence of correct traces in order to localize the error cause in an error <b>trace,</b> <b>report</b> a single error trace per error cause, and gen-erate multiple error traces having independent causes. We have implemented this algorithm in the context of Slam, a software model checker that automatically verifies temporal safety properties of C programs, and report on our experi-ence using it to find and localize errors in device drivers. The algorithm typically narrows the location of a cause down to a few lines, even in traces consisting of hundreds of state-ments. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E

In task 3. 3 'Trip-related Factors' it was tried to characterise accidents that are caused by certain contributing factors found on a trip level. This was done by applying one statistical method to existing databases of the WP 3 Partners {{on the one hand}} and on the other hand by performing an in-depth case analysis using the WP 5 method. The analysed factors stem from the Human Component of the accident causation classification, namely "alcohol", "vigilance", and "experience", from the Vehicle Component, namely "vehicle condition/maintenance", and from the Environment component, namely "road layout" and "road condition". This selection resulted from the task 3. 1 conclusions and feasibility reasons.

40|$|We {{estimate}} trade execution {{costs for}} {{a sample of}} institutional (insurance company) trades in corporate bonds {{before and after the}} initiation of public transaction reporting for some bonds through the TRACE system in July 2002. The results indicate a remarkable 50 % reduction in trade execution costs for bonds eligible for <b>TRACE</b> transaction <b>reporting,</b> and a 20 % reduction for bonds not eligible for <b>TRACE</b> <b>reporting.</b> The latter result likely reflects that better pricing information regarding some bonds also improves valuation and execution cost monitoring for related bonds. Larger trading cost reductions are estimated for less liquid and lower-rated bonds, and for larger trades. The key results are robust to allowances for changes in variables, such as interest rate volatility and trading activity, which might also affect execution costs. We find no evidence that market quality deteriorated in other dimensions. The point estimates equate to annual trading cost reductions of roughly $ 370 million per year for the entire corporate bond market, reinforcing that market design can have first-order effects, even for relatively sophisticated institutional customers. 1...|$|R

40|$|Congestion {{control in}} IP {{networks}} is typically done at each router through queue management, {{and the network}} is entirely dependent on the end hosts to react congestion. However, when misbehaving flows exist and continue to send their packets in very high rates, the queue management schemes implemented in current IP routers reveal a signifi-cant shortcoming in protecting legitimate flows. In this pa-per, we propose a novel scheme for congestion control in IP networks. Our approach is a time-window based filtering mechanism implemented in a router and processed before a queue management policy is applied. Setting the window size properly and dropping packets reaching in the next win-dow can catch the non-responsive nature of misbehaving flows.

40|$|Minnesota Ground Water Association poster {{presentation}} outlining {{the development of}} a groundwater tracing database in Minnesota. In the karst regions of Minnesota, groundwater tracing using fluorescent dyes has proven to be an effective method for understanding groundwater flow, travel times and interconnections with surface water (streams, creeks, etc). Dye tracing in Southeast (SE) Minnesota has a long history. The first documented traces were performed by S. P. Kingston, a public safety engineer at the Minnesota Department of Health, in the late 1930 s. Kingston used fluorescent dye to discover the source of an outbreak of typhoid fever in Fillmore and Olmsted Counties and published his work in the Journal of the American Water Works Association. Additionally, Ron Spong conducted over 30 traces beginning in the 1970 s across several counties in SE Minnesota. Most of the dye tracing in Minnesota since that time has been a collaborative effort between the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources but stakeholders such as towns and cities, soil and water conservation districts, the local caving community and generations of students have often been involved as well. Dye tracing involves using fluorescent dyes to determine groundwater flow direction and velocity by pouring dye into a sinkhole or sinking stream and observing where it emerges (usually at a spring or multiple springs) after flowing through the karst conduit system. Positive sampling results allow scientists to infer approximate groundwater flowpaths, calculate minimum velocities, and begin to delineate springsheds. In general, springsheds are composed of Groundwater Springsheds (GwS), Surface Water Springsheds (SWS) and Regional Groundwater Springsheds (RGS) and understanding their combined extent is important for the protection of trout stream resources and other ecosystems in Minnesota karst areas and elsewhere. Additionally, water protection and management associated with spill response, agriculture, water demands and landscape alteration require effective means for delineating springsheds. Many dye traces and the resulting springshed delineations have been accomplished in SE Minnesota, but the results and reporting have had varying degrees of accessibility. The goal of the current project is to produce a web accessible database containing as many groundwater dye tracing results as possible. This effort involves mining <b>trace</b> <b>reports,</b> data tables, and field notes and organizing their contents using GIS. The DNR Dye <b>Trace</b> <b>Reports</b> webpage currently has a list of links to historic and recent dye <b>trace</b> <b>reports</b> that are catalogued and made publicly available on the University of Minnesota Digital Conservancy. Geospatial data (dye input points, inferred groundwater flowpaths and springshed delineations) are re-evaluated in some cases, quality checked, and then digitized. Eventually this data will be made available via the DNR webpage {{in the form of an}} accessible ArcGIS Online map interface where users can query, select and view the data and associated reports with the click of a button. This database is intended to be used in conjunction with the Minnesota Karst Features Database (Gao, Yongli. (2002) “Karst Feature Distribution in Southeastern Minnesota: Extending GIS-Based Database for Spatial Analysis and Resource Management. ”. PhD Thesis, Univ. of Minn., Geology & Geophysics Dept., 210 p.) and will likely be incorporated into an enterprise system of spatially related databases built upon the Karst Feature Database and the Minnesota Spring Inventory. The Minnesota Dye Trace Database is an important element to manage and protect groundwater in Minnesota. Revitalizing dye tracing data, making the documentation available, and creating a user friendly interface will add context to the knowledge and expansive inventory of karst in Minnesota and will hopefully allow this significant dataset to live in perpetuity for generations of scientists and policy makers to come...|$|R

We analyze the dispersion of month-end price marks simultaneously placed on identical corporate bonds by different US mutual fund managers before and after TRACE dissemination and introductions of issuers into Markit’s Credit Default Swap spread database.

Dispersion for large, investment grade bonds fell 20 % to 83 % after the start of <b>TRACE</b> <b>reporting.</b> We also find evidence of spillover effects for non-disseminated bonds. During the pre-TRACE period, we find some evidence that mark dispersion fell for investment grade issuers after introductions into Markit’s database.
