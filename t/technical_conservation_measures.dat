40|$|The {{principal}} {{inshore fishery}} {{in the southwest}} Irish Sea is currently for whelk Buccinum undatum, which expanded in the 1990 s and yielded almost 10, 000 Â t in 2003. The fleet exploiting it consisted largely of old boats many of which previously {{used a variety of}} gears but which cannot any longer compete with more modern towing craft. Whelk is the only target species for the majority. The fishery is in open access and is not regulated and the paper examines the consequences of this for the fishers, particularly the problems associated with maintaining a way of life traditionally associated with remuneration by share rather than wage. Lack of regulation, it is argued, encourages a short term, opportunistic harvesting regime, which is not conducive to maintain a biologically sustainable fishery.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Cod Recovery Plan that was {{implemented}} in the Irish Sea in 2004. The plan was constructed within the Common Fisheries Policy, and applied to several European cod stocks that was fished unsustainably. It involved a system of measures including drastic reduction in TACs, closed spawning area, <b>technical</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> and effort restriction {{in the form of}} “Days at Sea. ” This was not new to the fisheries in this area since the three former measures had been applied from 2000 as ICES gave warnings about the poor state of this particular stock. The implementation process has been characterised by conflicts, horse-trading and lack of evaluation. For many in the industry the measures have been draconian, others will claim they should have been tougher. Many differing but entangled factors and interests are involved and together {{with a high degree of}} complexity and unclear objectives the lack of legitimacy may be undermining the plan.

Land Husbandry policy recommendations were made, to be refined and updated as trials results and associated experiences are collected. Soil conservation legislation in Malawi was examined with the view of holding a future workshop on the subject. Additional recommendations concern Sustainable Agriculture, <b>Technical</b> Soil <b>Conservation</b> <b>Measures</b> and <b>Conservation</b> Farming Systems.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasing}} evidence of complex population structure and varying rates ofexchange of commercially exploited marine ﬁsh stocks between different management areas,the stock assessment methods currently used by ICES to advise on {{total allowable catches}} (TACs) and <b>technical</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> still take only limited account of seasonal mi-grations and movements. As an example, plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L., is currently man-aged as a single stock in the North Sea. However a combined experimental approach usingconventional tagging data, {{and the release of}} hundreds of plaice tagged with electronic datastorage tags, have allowed the identiﬁcation of population substructure and the characterisa-tion of annual migration routes and spawning areas. More recently, otolith microchemistryhas been used to determine the contribution of larvae from different spawning areas to dif-ferent nursery grounds, and the input from the nursery grounds to the adult population sub-units. Here a biologically-based population movement simulation model is presented whichutilizes data from each of these sources. The effects of a range of area and seasonal closureswere tested in terms of reduction in overall ﬁshing mortality. Results from this study illus-trate the value of high-quality biological data to improve current advice on biologically andtechnically interacting ﬁsh stocks and ﬁsheries...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the fish}} escape {{behaviour}} through bycatch reduction devices {{is the cornerstone}} of their application as <b>technical</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> To evaluate square meshes and sorting grids as successful size-selective bycatch reduction devices in finfish trawls, we conducted a simulated trawling experiment to assess the effects of illumination, towing speed and mesh or grid orientation on the escape behaviour of undersized fish through square meshes and rigid grids. Juvenile masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) with average body length 13 cm were used as the experimental fish. A speed-controllable motor was used to tow the framed net in a circular water tank. An infrared CCD (charge-coupled devices) camera fixed to the towed net by means of a rotary connector was used to observe fish behaviour. In contrast to the active escape seen under lighted conditions, there was no active voluntary escape under dark conditions. As a result, no fish escaped through parallel and backward-sloping meshes, and only 13 % of fish escaped through the forward-sloping meshes when the towing speed was increased. On the other hand, the encounter probability and passive escape through the longer openings in the backward-sloping grid increased under the dark condition, resulting in the highest escape ratio. This increased from 67 to 87 % on increasing the towing speed from 1 to 1. 5 knots, and shortened the swimming time before escaping from 5 to 1. 5 min (the highest escape ratio and the shortest swimming time before escaping under the dark condition). Frame-by-frame analysis of some escape events demonstrated easy, passive fish escape through the grids with no change in the normal swimming direction. The results support the backward-sloping grid as an efficient bycatch-reduction device, especially in demersal trawling when placed well ahead of the codend, working in the dark at high towing speeds...|$|E

40|$|The EU Habitats Directive {{provides}} in Annexes II and IV a list {{of species}} needing to be conserved. Member States have implemented a variety of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> {{in response to this}} obligation. These measures include the rejection, modification or delay of land development plans, payments for landowners to perform <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> and management actions such as breeding programmes. The costs of the various <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> are not always apparent. There may be an underestimation of the resulting costs when land development plans are altered, because there is no visible flow of financial resources. Such a biased perception may result in selecting <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> with high but less visible costs, whereas <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> with low but more visible costs are neglected. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to avoiding a biased selection of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> by presenting a framework which captures a broad variety of costs relevant to the conservation of species protected by the Habitats Directive. We also demonstrate the relevance of a biased selection of <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> by using the framework to empirically estimate the costs of protecting the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) in the region of Mannheim, Germany. We find that the less visible costs of changes in development plans are significantly higher than the more visible costs of payments to landowners and management actions. This result suggests that measures with visible costs should be given more attention in the future.

40|$|Research PaperAs a Member State of the European Community (EC), the United Kingdom's marine capture {{fisheries}} must {{be managed}} {{within the framework}} of the Community's common fisheries policy (see Box 1). Since 1983 this has included a system of annual total allowable catches (TACs) for most commercially important stocks within the zone of extended fisheries jurisdiction created by the 200 -mile limits of all the EC Member States with coastlines bordering the North East Atlantic and adjacent seas. The TACs are divided into national catch quotas according to an established allocation mechanism which gives each Member State a fixed percentage share each year (although a number of international quota swaps are regularly undertaken). While the national fishing fleets are subject to certain common input controls under the common fisheries policy (in particular <b>technical</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> such as minimum mesh sizes) each Member State is free to determine the means for allocating its quotas and for regulating quota uptake. EC rules do, however, require all vessels of 10 metres or over in length to keep a logbook of their activities which must include details of the quantities of TAC species caught and retained on board and the time and location of capture. Inshore vessels of less than 10 metres long are not obliged to carry logbooks but Member States are still required to monitor their landings to ensure that national quota limits are respected. Figure 1 shows the sea areas surrounding the United Kingdom according to the ICES nomenclature used to denominate fish stocks in the North East Atlantic. The main areas, within which United Kingdom vessels are active, are the North Sea (Area IV), West of Scotland and Rockall (Area VI), the Irish Sea (Area VIIa), the English Channel (Areas VIId and VIIe), the Bristol Channel and South East of Ireland (Areas VIIf and VIIg) and Western Waters (Areas VIIh-k).

40|$|AbstractLoss {{of natural}} forests and decline in forest {{biodiversity}} {{has led to}} several policy initiatives in recent years. Despite this, the importance of smaller set-asides vs forest reserves for <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the importance of three different area-based <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> commonly used in north-European forests; retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest nature reserves. We did this for two contrasting ecological systems; fungi in late-decay spruce logs and beetles in early-decay aspen snags. Eight replicated sites {{for each of the}} three <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> were investigated in a total of four boreal forest landscapes in south-Norway. Fungi were surveyed on existent late-decay spruce logs in two landscapes, and beetles trapped on experimentally added aspen dead-wood units in three landscapes. Richness and species composition were analyzed separately for specialist and generalist species. We found larger differences in species composition between <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> for old-growth fungi specialists than generalists, although species richness patterns were less clear. The main contrast was found between nature reserves and retention patches. On the other hand, specialist beetles associated with early-decay aspen showed no difference between set-asides. The assemblage of aspen generalist beetles tended to be richest in the woodland key habitats and showed clear differences between the <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> There was considerable variation in response to <b>conservation</b> <b>measures</b> between landscapes, related to quality of the set-asides. Species specialized to an ephemeral, early-decay system were able to utilize such substrates in all of the <b>conservation</b> <b>measures,</b> while the smaller and more modified set-asides could not cater for the specialists dependent on stable, late-decay systems. Species with broader habitat demands in general responded to all <b>conservation</b> <b>measures.</b> We conclude that retention patches, woodland key habitats and forest reserves fill complementary functions for wood-living species in boreal forest and should all be part of future forest conservation strategies...|$|R
