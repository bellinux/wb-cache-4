5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten miles south of <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> meetinghouse. Within months, someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in <b>the</b> <b>Boston</b> church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, {{the theology of the}} Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
