In addition, FRUMEL [...] - [...] the US-Australian-British unit based in Melbourne that replaced CAST [...] - [...] was reportedly reluctant to exchange material. However, in September 1942 Kilindini was able to break the Japanese Merchant Shipping Code, JN-40, because a message was sent twice with extra data. It was a <b>transposition</b> <b>cypher,</b> not a super-enciphered code like JN-25. They also broke JN-152 a simple transposition and substitution cypher for navigation warnings and the previously impenetrable JN-167, another merchant shipping cypher. These successes enabled Allied forces e.g. submarines to attack Japanese supply ships, and resulted in the Japanese merchant marine suffering 90 per cent losses by August 1945.|$|E

To make the systems more robust, cyphers or crypts being used {{need to be}} analysed for which cryptanalysts require ways to automate the process, so that cryptographic systems can be tested more efficiently. Evolutionary algorithms provide one such resort as these are capable of searching global optimal solution very quickly. Cuckoo Search (CS) Algorithm has been used effectively in cryptanalysis of conventional systems like Vigenere and <b>Transposition</b> <b>cyphers.</b> Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a crypto primitive used extensively in design of cryptosystems. In this paper, we analyse LFSR based cryptosystem using Cuckoo Search to find correct initial states of used LFSR. Primitive polynomials of degree 11, 13, 17 and 19 are considered to analyse text crypts of length 200, 300 and 400 characters. Optimal solutions were obtained for the following CS parameters: Levy distribution parameter (β)  =  1. 5 and Alien eggs discovering probability (pa)  =  0. 25...|$|R
