Lynch spent {{the next few months}} in non-title matches against Charlotte, losing <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> On the 23 October episode of NXT, after being told to make herself relevant, Lynch aligned herself with Sasha Banks by attacking Bayley, turning into a villainess in the process. Known as Team B.A.E. (Best at Everything), the alliance started to disintegrate when Banks cost Lynch a match against Bayley in February 2015.|$|E

5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two unmatched runs of <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club {{with more than one}} final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{played his}} final MLB season in 1951, while highly touted outfielder Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York. Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw two no-hitters during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant {{for the third}} {{straight}} year. They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants, four games to two. When their 1952 team took the AL pennant, the Yankees had an opportunity to match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In another Yankees–Dodgers matchup, New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title. New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the 1953 World Series, and a Billy Martin base hit that decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row. As of 2016, the 1949–1953 Yankees are the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series; no team since has won more than <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E

The decade started poorly, with Hawthorn failing to finish {{in the top five}} (as it was then known) and seen by most critics as a spent force. Coach David Parkin left and agreed to coach Carlton and captain Don Scott would shortly retire after playing his 300th game. In a surprise appointment Hawthorn persuaded former St Kilda premiership coach Allan Jeans to coach the team. Jeans had not coached in the VFL for five years.|$|E
25|$|The team took a {{step back}} in 2005 with a 6–10 record. McNabb had played with a sports hernia and a broken thumb, {{starting}} 4–2 but losing <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> before McNabb finally succumbs to injury and is out {{for the rest of the}} season. For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In 2006, the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil, but Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under Coach Reid, with a 10–6 record and a win in the wild card round, but they had an 8–8 2007 season. In 2008, the team won their 500th game, and they also drafted DeSean Jackson, a receiving threat when paired with McNabb.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{dramatic}} 1997 season, Ferrari {{came out with}} an all new car to fit the new regulations for 1998, the F300. Although it was a competitive package, the McLaren–Mercedes MP4/13 was most often stronger. Schumacher won six races that season including <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> at Canada, France and Great Britain. The Hungarian Grand Prix was won after a tactical master-stroke by Brawn {{decided to make the}} car run a 3-stop strategy as opposed to McLaren's 2. Schumacher then went on to lead Irvine home to Ferrari's first 1–2 at Monza since the memorable 1988 race after Enzo Ferrari's death. Schumacher lost the title to McLaren's Mika Häkkinen at Suzuka after he stalled on the front row then suffered a mid-race puncture. Irvine was fourth in the championship with Ferrari second in the constructors' title.|$|E
25|$|The city of Basel and {{the city}} of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB's most {{traditional}} and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich's narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> if they won or drew against Zürich at home {{on the last day of}} the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.|$|E

The Blue Hens of Delaware stood in the way of history. Senior running back Kevin Richardson led the way for the Mountaineers with 111 yards rushing and 27 receiving, finishing his career as Appalachian's all-time leading rusher with 4,797 yards. Accounting for three passing touchdowns, Armanti Edwards threw for 198 yards and rushed for another 98. The Blue Hens offensive attack was paced by future National Football League first round draft pick Joe Flacco at quarterback, who threw for 334 yards and one touchdown. Trey Elder, in his last game in black and gold, finished the scoring for the Mountaineers with a 53-yard scamper to make the score 49–14. Armanti Edwards finished the season with 1,948 yards passing and 1,587 yards rushing. He was 52 passing yards short of becoming only the second player in NCAA history to pass for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000 twice. The record attendance of 23,010 on hand at Finley Stadium was the largest neutral site crowd for the NCAA Division I Championship Game.|$|E

25|$|After {{a pair of}} third-place {{finishes}} in 1985 and 1986, the 1987 Tigers faced lowered expectations – {{which seemed to be}} confirmed by an 11–19 start to the season. However, the team hit its stride thereafter and gradually gained ground on its AL East rivals, eventually finishing with {{the best record in the}} Majors. This charge was fueled in part by the acquisition of pitcher Doyle Alexander from the Atlanta Braves in exchange for minor league pitcher John Smoltz. Alexander started 11 games for the Tigers, posting 9–0 record and a 1.53 ERA. Smoltz, a Lansing, Michigan, native, went on to have a long and productive career, mostly with the Braves, winning the Cy Young Award in 1996. The Tigers won the division this year but possibly gave up some of their future. The Tigers had a great season but despite their improvement, they entered September neck-and-neck with the Toronto Blue Jays. The two teams would square off in seven hard-fought games during the final two weeks of the season. All seven games were decided by one run, and in the first six of the seven games, the winning run was scored in the final inning of play. At Exhibition Stadium, the Tigers dropped <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> to the Blue Jays before winning a dramatic extra-inning showdown.|$|E

25|$|In 1983–84, the Oilers {{finished}} first {{overall in the}} NHL, winning a franchise record fifty-seven games and earning 119 points (fifteen points ahead of the second place Islanders). They were {{the first team to}} feature three players with fifty goals (Gretzky, Kurri and Anderson). Gretzky started off strong by scoring at least a point in the first fifty-one games of the season. Paul Coffey became the second defenceman ever to score forty goals in a season (with forty exactly). The Oilers scored a grand total of 446 goals as a team, an NHL record. The Oilers were so determined to win the Stanley Cup that they hired Roger Neilson as a video analyst. They started the playoffs strongly by sweeping the Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division semifinals. They faced a tougher test in the Calgary Flames, but they defeated them in seven games in the division finals. They then swept the Minnesota North Stars in the conference finals to earn a rematch with the Islanders in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers split the first two games in Long Island, but then won <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in Edmonton to become the first former WHA team to win the Stanley Cup. After the series, Mark Messier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.|$|E
