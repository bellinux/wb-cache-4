5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad <b>taste,</b> <b>with</b> one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, {{it is not}} recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet taste that turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Fingleton divided {{his time}} between Canberra, where until his {{retirement}} in 1978 he was political correspondent for Radio Australia, and cricket journalism. He forged close relationships with several Prime Ministers. In particular, Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, provided him with a laudatory foreword in his book, Masters of Cricket. Fingleton's Test coverage resulted in a number of books that placed him at the forefront of Australian cricket writers. The books included Cricket Crisis (mainly an account of the 1932–33 Bodyline series), Brightly Fades the Don (the 1948 Invincibles tour), Brown & Company: The Tour in Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1950–51), The Ashes Crown the Year (the Australian tour of England in 1953), Masters of Cricket, Four Chukkas to Australia (the English tour of Australia in 1958–59), The Greatest Test of All (the Tied Test of 1960), Fingleton on Cricket and The Immortal Victor Trumper. His final book, the autobiographical Batting From Memory, was to have its Australian launch during the week in which he died of a heart attack. His cricket writing, {{regarded as one of the}} most stylish by an Australian, often left a sour <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> observers because of the persistent anti-Bradman jibes.|$|E

25|$|Monarchs {{share the}} defense of noxious <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> the similar-appearing viceroy {{butterfly}} in what is {{perhaps one of the}} most well-known examples of mimicry. Though long purported to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy is actually reportedly more unpalatable than the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|Petipa {{appealed to}} popular <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> The Pharaoh's Daughter (1862), and later The Talisman (1889), and La Bayadère (1877). Petipa is best remembered for his collaborations with Tchaikovsky. He used his music for his choreography of The Nutcracker (1892, {{though this is}} open to some debate among historians), The Sleeping Beauty (1890), and the {{definitive}} revival of Swan Lake (1895, with Lev Ivanov). These works were all drawn from European folklore.|$|E
25|$|The only {{additive}} allowed is salt, {{which the}} cheese absorbs while being submerged for 20 days in brine tanks saturated to near total salinity with Mediterranean sea salt. The product is aged {{an average of}} two years. The cheese is produced daily, and it can show a natural variability. True Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese has a sharp, complex fruity/nutty <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> a strong savory flavor and a slightly gritty texture. Inferior versions can impart a bitter taste.|$|E

Food court menus are tailored to international <b>tastes,</b> <b>with</b> meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK. Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local <b>tastes,</b> <b>with</b> a mix of both American and local products available.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} karmas provide different {{abilities of}} tastes to the bodies: tikta rasa nama-karma gives a bitter taste (like {{that of the}} nimba fruit), kasaya rasa nama-karma gives an astringent taste (like that of bibhitaka), amla rasa nama-karma gives a sour taste (like that of tamarind) and madhura rasa nama-karma gives a sweet taste (like that of sugar). The salt taste is produced {{by a combination of}} the sweet <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.|$|E
25|$|Some insects {{present in}} the grapes at harvest inevitably {{end up in the}} press {{and for the most part}} are inoffensive. Others, notably types of ladybirds, or the multicoloured Asian lady beetle, release {{unpleasant}} volatile compounds as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's bouquet and <b>taste.</b> <b>With</b> an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compounds are methoxypyrazines, or pyrazines, that are perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter herb, green bell pepper, or cat urine. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so ladybird taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
25|$|The first multi-team testing session {{took place}} at Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona in November 2008, {{two weeks after the}} end of {{previous}} season. All teams, except Toyota, took part in the testing session where some teams tested their new aerodynamics package and slick tyres. The new look cars did not suit everyone's <b>taste,</b> <b>with</b> BMW Sauber's test driver, Christian Klien, labelling the car the ugliest car he'd ever seen. On 9 March, testing at Barcelona featured for the first time Brawn GP, who made an immediate impact by leading the times early in the day. The test, the first in which all teams used their 2009 cars, had BMW Sauber leading the times while Brawn GP finished fourth. On day three, Brawn GP's Jenson Button was fastest by just over one second to Ferrari's Felipe Massa, while Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello went even faster the next day. At {{the other end of the}} timing sheets, reigning Champion Lewis Hamilton's McLaren team were struggling to adapt to the new regulations, often 1.5 seconds off the pace. Massa stated he had never seen McLaren so far behind.|$|E

25|$|People {{who suffer}} from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the {{disorder}} has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake {{and can lead to}} weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.|$|E
500|$|Hot {{chocolate}} can be {{made with}} dark, semisweet, or bittersweet chocolate chopped into small pieces and stirred into milk with the addition of sugar. American instant hot cocoa powder often includes powdered milk or other dairy ingredients so it {{can be made}} without using milk. In the United Kingdom, [...] "hot chocolate" [...] is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water, and powder containing chocolate, sugar, and powdered milk. [...] "Cocoa" [...] usually refers to a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder, then sweetened to <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> sugar (or not sweetened at all).|$|E
500|$|Handel {{joined the}} Hamburg opera house {{when it was}} {{experiencing}} a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. [...] In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, {{at least one of}} which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular <b>taste,</b> <b>with</b> a flair for writing Italian-style arias. [...] Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examined}} preconceptions {{of taste}} based on color with a questionnaire administered to 45 college students. The questionnaire related 8 <b>tastes</b> <b>with</b> 10 colors. The results suggested {{that only a}} limited number of colors are positively associated <b>with</b> preconceptions of <b>taste.</b> However, certain colors (e. g., red and green) showed consistent patterns of association <b>with</b> <b>taste.</b> Implications for future research examining an indirect relationship between color and taste are discussed...|$|R

500|$|The cap is {{initially}} convex, {{but as it}} matures the center forms a depression and the outer edges rise until it assumes {{the shape of a}} shallow funnel; its final width is typically between [...] The cap margin is strongly curled inward; when young, it is tomentose (covered with a thick matting of hairs), forming a veil-like structure that partly covers up the gills. This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly tomentose, but eventually the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth. The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a zonate pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity. The cap color is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored flesh is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The latex that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills. It has an acrid <b>taste,</b> <b>with</b> a slight to pungent odor.|$|E
500|$|Voice coach John Quinlan was {{impressed}} by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either". [...] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was [...] "the best singer in the business". [...] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had [...] "perfected the art of intimacy." [...] According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a [...] "fairly rangy voice", [...] remarking that [...] "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite <b>taste,</b> <b>with</b> an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint". Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was [...] "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming [...] "precise" [...] and articulation [...] "meticulous". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to [...] "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric". [...] Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would [...] "take a musical phrase and play {{it all the way}} through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." [...] Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News {{considered}} the album's title {{to be influenced}} by Janet Jackson's Damita Jo, which was also based on an alternate persona. According to Jenson Macey from BBC News, The Emancipation of Mimi was Carey's strongest effort from the 2000s; he said that the album [...] "took her straight back {{to the top of the}} A-List." [...] Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling it [...] "cool, focused and urban." [...] The New York Timess, Jon Pareles, complimented how Carey wrote all of the album's material. He felt the record's sound was fresh and innovative: [...] "on The Emancipation of Mimi, she disciplines herself into coherence, using fewer tricks and sounding more believable. She also finds what lesser singers can take for granted: a certain lightness that eases her constant sense of control." [...] Cummings from PopMatters gave the album seven stars out of ten, claiming it to be Carey's redemption from the manacles of her previous two releases. He praised the album's singles, but called some of its music [...] "corny" [...] and [...] "unnecessarily overproduced". Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B−, admiring its assortment of beats and tempos. Burns, however, called some of The Neptunes and Dupri's production [...] "ill-advised". He called some of Carey's vocals [...] "strained, thin and airy". While considering it as an improvement over her previous releases of the decade, he concluded that it [...] "suffers from the fact that her vocals have deteriorated – a simple fact of the ravages that her voice has undergone in the past fifteen years." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave The Emancipation of Mimi three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "redemption". He complimented its array of beats and its production. Critic Andre Meyer of CBS News thought the material on the album was [...] "stronger" [...] than on Charmbracelet, and described it as a move in Carey's long-term plan for pop domination, while giving off the [...] "jittery R vibe that made Destiny's Child so potent." [...] He added that [...] "Mariah has returned to singing – while still pushing the limits of good <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> her barely there outfits." ...|$|E
