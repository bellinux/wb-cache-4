5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|The median nerve can be {{compressed}} by {{a decrease}} {{in the size of the}} canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both. Since the carpal tunnel is bordered by carpal bones on one side and a ligament on the other, when the pressure builds up inside the tunnel, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> for it to escape and thus it ends up pressing up against and damaging the median nerve. Simply flexing the wrist to 90 degrees will decrease the size of the canal.|$|E

500|$|Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Kelvin MacKenzie {{expressed}} similar sentiments. MacKenzie criticised newspapers {{including his}} own employer, The Sun. He stated, [...] "if you believe you're a victim of an ethnic minority and you're white <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> to go. Editors are so liberal that they are scared to be seen that they're moving {{to the right of}} their paper". Parker's mother, Davinia, expressed similar concerns that white victims of race crime are ignored. She said [...] "because we are white, English, we didn't get the coverage", adding [...] ""it's as if we don't count".|$|E
500|$|Trucks {{have been}} {{prohibited}} for the [...] "safety {{and welfare of}} the public" [...] since 1934 because of the state's approval of a local ordinance that was championed by Frank Hague, mayor of Jersey City. They are detoured to use U.S. Route1/9 Truck, along {{the route of the}} Lincoln Highway that carried traffic before the skyway's construction. Pedestrians and cyclists are banned, as the road has no dedicated lanes or sidewalks. The speed limit on the skyway is , but is generally not enforceable as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> for police to pull over speeders because of the absence of shoulders.|$|E
500|$|On 1 November 2012, Novakovic {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} be leaving Neighbours to pursue acting opportunities in the United States. Of her decision to leave the serial, Novakovic stated [...] "Australia is small compared to what else is out there, especially in Los Angeles. I love acting and it's what I want to do, so why not be in the thick of it all? I certainly love to do more Aussie things but, being realistic, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> near as much opportunity here." [...] During her first interview since announcing her departure, Novakovic explained that her main reasons for leaving Neighbours were to try other things and explore different characters. The actress said that she had wanted to do two years with the show, but when the time came, she decided to stay for another year to prepare herself to leave.|$|E

Realizing <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> to go, and no-one {{will come to the}} rescue, the person helplessly awaits {{impending}} doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album's opener. It was inspired by a track Hammett's former band Exodus had demoed called [...] "Impaler", which was later released on that band's 2004 album Tempo of the Damned. [...] "Escape" [...] was originally titled [...] "The Hammer" [...] and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-stroked riff. Authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome felt the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay at rock radio. Metallica performed [...] "Escape" [...] live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music+ More festival, while performing Ride the Lightning in its entirety.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to its function as a land drainage channel and for water supply, the river is also used for recreation. The waterway is managed by the Environment Agency, which requires all vessels to be registered and in possession of an up-to-date licence. There are over 200 boats registered, and there are moorings at Ferriby, Brigg, Brandy Wharf and Bishopbridge. Access {{to and from the}} Humber is restricted by extensive mud banks to the north of Ferriby Sluice, which are exposed at low tide. Passage through South Ferriby lock is therefore limited to three hours either side of high tide. The river is large enough to support small barges and medium-sized cabin cruisers. South Ferriby lock is [...] with a draught of [...] Harlam Hill lock is smaller, at [...] but the effective maximum length of boats is , as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> above the lock to turn a longer boat. Small boats can be launched from a slipway at Brandy Wharf Leisure Park, on the western bank of the river.|$|E

60|$|The sun was {{overhead}} {{when they}} scrambled, gasping, over {{the crest of}} the divide and looked down into another long, winding hollow.

2500|$|An updated {{variant of}} the {{broadcast}} flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management group under DVB (DVB-CPCM). Upon publication by DVB, the technical specification was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, {{at the direction of}} the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the EFF, which paid {{to be a member of}} the consortium, [...] "You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices". The DVB claims that the system will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies, thereby making things easier for end users. The normative sections have now all been approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board, and will be published by ETSI as a formal European Standard as ETSI TS 102 825-X where X refers to the Part number of specification. Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a Compliance and Robustness regime for the standard (though several are rumoured to be in development), so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> to obtain the necessary device certificates.|$|E

60|$|They bore {{him up to}} the mission-house, since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> else whither {{he could}} be taken. Here they laid him on a bed, leaving the woman, Ivana, to watch him, for they had no skill to deal with such {{injuries}} as his. Indeed, they thought him dead.|$|R
60|$|She {{waved her}} hand to him and ran lightly up the steps. The Marquis threw himself back {{in his car and}} hesitated.

50|$|A {{glance at}} the Upper Harz 'ponds' (Teiche) near Clausthal-Zellerfeld and Hahnenklee {{suggested}} a solution. At that time <b>there</b> must have <b>been</b> 50 to 60 small reservoirs in operation.

25|$|His career spanned {{everything}} from artist and poet to teacher, rock-and-roll performer, playwright and librettist.

60|$|True for {{the moment}} the Englishman had dis{{appeared}}. Burden and all, the gloom appeared to have swallowed him up.

60|$|Then {{she went}} to her own room and went to bed. This last shock was too much for her nerves to bear. In the {{afternoon}} Willy brought her some tea, but the poor lady would not get up.
