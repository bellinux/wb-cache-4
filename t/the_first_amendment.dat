5|$|Beyond the First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech and Pluralism is a {{book about}} {{freedom of speech and}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the United States Constitution, written by author Samuel Peter Nelson.

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment,</b> which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1999, the AFA {{filed the}} {{suit against the}} City and County of San Francisco with support from Family Research Council and Virginia based Kerusso Ministries. The suit claims the City and County of San Francisco {{violated}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Establishment Clause by expressing hostility towards a religion and violated <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses by the City’s attempt to prevent [...] "Truth in Love" [...] advertisements.|$|R
5|$|Before any {{questions}} of First Amendment law could be decided, the Court had to first determine whether TSSAA {{was a state}} entity and so whether <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> applied.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} issues raised on appeal was that the defendants' {{political}} advocacy was protected by <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment,</b> because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|The Act's {{labeling}} {{requirement is}} unconstitutionally compelled speech under <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{because it does}} not require the disclosure of purely factual information, but compels the carrying of the State's controversial Opinion.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by recognizing that <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court {{pointed out that}} precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> of the U.S. Constitution {{guarantees}} {{the free exercise}} of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by critics. Jeffrey Rosen, who reviewed {{the book for}} The New York Times, {{was surprised by the}} author's departure from traditional civil libertarian views. Rosen pointed out that Lewis did not support absolute protection for journalists from breaking confidentiality with their anonymous sources, even in situations involving criminal acts. Nat Hentoff called the book an engrossing and accessible survey of <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment.</b> Kirkus Reviews considered the book an excellent chronological account of <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment,</b> subsequent legislation, and case law.|$|E
5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that the Court should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the WIPO case Glynnis MacNicol of Mediaite commented that those including Glenn Beck afforded freedom of speech guaranteed by <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> must allow for an Internet environment with the same rights given to everyone. Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the case that the division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> erected a metaphorical wall of separation {{between church and}} state. During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered {{the opinion of the}} court in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also to the states.|$|E

50|$|This case {{incorporated}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Free Exercise Clause, thereby {{applying it}} {{to the states and}} protecting free exercise of religion from intrusive state action. The Establishment Clause was incorporated seven years later in Everson v. Board of Education (1947).|$|R
5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while {{supportive}} of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> right to {{free exercise of religion}} and conscience.
