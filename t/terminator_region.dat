50|$|The gene to be {{inserted}} into the genetically modified organism must be combined with other genetic elements in order for it to work properly. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. As well as the gene to {{be inserted}} most constructs contain a promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>region</b> {{as well as a}} selectable marker gene. The promoter region initiates transcription of the gene and can be used to control the location and level of gene expression, while the <b>terminator</b> <b>region</b> ends transcription. The selectable marker, which in most cases confers antibiotic resistance to the organism it is expressed in, is needed to determine which cells are transformed with the new gene. The constructs are made using recombinant DNA techniques, such as restriction digests, ligations and molecular cloning.|$|E
50|$|Rho-dependent {{termination}} uses a termination factor called ρ factor(rho factor) {{which is}} a protein to stop RNA synthesis at specific sites. This protein binds at a rho utilisation site on the nascent RNA strand and runs along the mRNA towards the RNAP. A stem loop structure upstream of the <b>terminator</b> <b>region</b> pauses the RNAP, when ρ-factor reaches the RNAP, it causes RNAP to dissociate from the DNA, terminating transcription.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{view of the}} RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription {{cycle is}} that RNAP II is recruited to the promoter, transcribes a linear DNA template, then terminates transcription and dissociates from the template. Subsequent rounds of transcription are thought to require de novo recruitment of RNAP II to the promoter. Several recent findings, including physical interaction of 3 ′-end processing factors with both promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions,</b> challenge this concept. Here we report a physical association of promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> of the yeast BUD 3 and SEN 1 genes. These interactions are transcription-dependent, require the Ssu 72 and Pta 1 components of the CPF 3 ′-end processing complex, and require the phosphatase activity of Ssu 72. We propose a model for RNAP II transcription in which promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> are juxtaposed, and that the resulting gene loops facilitate transcription reinitiation by the same molecule of RNAP II in a manner dependent upon Ssu 72 -mediated CTD dephosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{mapping of}} nucleosomes {{generated}} by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) suggests that yeast promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> are very depleted of nucleosomes, predominantly because their DNA sequences intrinsically disfavor nucleosome formation. However, MNase has strong DNA sequence specificity that favors cleavage at promoters and terminators and accounts {{for some of}} the correlation between occupancy patterns of nucleosomes assembled in vivo and in vitro. Using an improved method for measuring nucleosome occupancy in vivo that does not involve MNase, we confirm that promoter regions are strongly depleted of nucleosomes, but find that <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> are much less depleted than expected. Unlike at promoter regions, nucleosome occupancy at terminators is strongly correlated with the orientation of and distance to adjacent genes. In addition, nucleosome occupancy at terminators is strongly affected by growth conditions, indicating that it is not primarily determined by intrinsic histone–DNA interactions. Rapid removal of RNA polymerase II (pol II) causes increased nucleosome occupancy at terminators, strongly suggesting a transcription-based mechanism of nucleosome depletion. However, the distinct behavior of <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> and their corresponding coding regions suggests that nucleosome depletion at terminators is not simply associated with passage of pol II, but rather involves a distinct mechanism linked to 3 ’-end formation...|$|R

50|$|Before {{the gene}} is {{inserted}} into the target organism it must be combined with other genetic elements. These include a promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>region,</b> which initiate and end transcription. A selectable marker gene is added, which in most cases confers antibiotic resistance, so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. These manipulations are carried out using recombinant DNA techniques, such as restriction digests, ligations and molecular cloning.|$|E

These photographs were extremely useful as they showed surface features in strong relief. Now, with three persons on board, the crew were able to acquire many more handheld photographs, with one person always available to run the SIM and receive flight plan updates from Mission Control. The crew were also instructed to just turn on the Panoramic Camera and let it run now that all its primary targets had been imaged.|$|E
5000|$|The SAM riboswitch (also {{known as}} the S-box leader and now also called the SAM-I riboswitch) is found {{upstream}} {{of a number of}} genes which code for proteins involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Two SAM riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis that were experimentally studied act at the level of transcription termination control. The predicted secondary structure consists of a complex stem-loop region followed by a single stem-loop <b>terminator</b> <b>region.</b> An alternative and mutually exclusive form involves bases in the 3' segment of helix 1 with those in the 5' region of helix 5 to form a structure termed the anti-terminator form. [...] When SAM is unbound, the anti-terminator sequence sequesters the terminator sequence so the terminator is unable to form, allowing the polymerase read-through the downstream gene. When the SAM is bound to the aptamer, the anti-terminator is sequestered by an anti-anti-terminator; the terminator forms and terminates the transcription. However, many SAM riboswitches are likely to regulate gene expression at the level of translation.|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{demonstrated}} {{the existence of}} gene loops that juxtapose the promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> of genes with exceptionally long ORFs in yeast. Here we report that looping is not idiosyncratic to long genes but occurs between the distal ends of genes with ORFs as short as 1 kb. Moreover, looping is dependent upon the general transcription factor TFIIB: the E 62 K (glutamic acid 62 / lysine) form of TFIIB adversely affects looping at every gene tested, including BLM 10, SAC 3, GAL 10, SEN 1, and HEM 3. TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> of the PMA 1 and BLM 10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E 62 K and by depletion of the Ssu 72 component of the CPF 3 0 end processing complex, and is independent of TBP. We propose a model suggesting that TFIIB binds RNAP II at the terminator, which in turn associates with the promoter scaffold...|$|R
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{indicated}} that transcription is pervasive in regions outside of protein coding genes and that short antisense transcripts can originate from the promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> of genes. Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12 % to 16 % of all reads that originate from promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions,</b> respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, <b>terminator</b> and intron <b>regions</b> of proteincoding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias...|$|R

40|$|The 85 -kb breast cancer-associated gene BRCA 1 is an {{established}} tumor suppressor gene, but its regulation is poorly understood.

Loop formation is transcription-dependent, suggesting that transcriptional elongation plays {{an active role in}} BRCA 1 loop formation. We show that the BRCA 1 <b>terminator</b> <b>region</b> can suppress estrogen-induced transcription and so may regulate BRCA 1 expression. Significantly, BRCA 1 promoter and terminator interactions vary in different breast cancer cell lines, indicating that defects in BRCA 1 chromatin structure may contribute to clysregulated expression of BRCA 1 seen in breast tumors...|$|E

We show that homopolymer A/T tracts within the human β-globin CoTC-mediated terminator element {{play a critical role in}} Pol II termination.

Moreover, GAL 10 and a GAL 1 p-SEN 1 reporter undergo rapid reactivation kinetics following a cycle of activation and repression—a phenomenon defined as “transcriptional memory”—and this effect correlates with the persistence of looping.

Both of the repeated pBR 322 fragments and the three NOS promoter and <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> were challenging to resolve, even with the NGS data.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{observations}} {{have shown that}} Rayleigh scattering by aerosols dominates the transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b at wavelengths shortward of 1 μm. In this study, we retrieve a range of aerosol distributions consistent with transmission spectroscopy between 0. 3 - 24 μm that were recently re-analyzed by Pont et al. (2013). To constrain the particle size and the optical depth of the aerosol layer, we investigate the degeneracies between aerosol composition, temperature, planetary radius, and molecular abundances that prevent unique solutions for transit spectroscopy. Assuming that the aerosol is composed of MgSiO_ 3, we suggest that a vertically uniform aerosol layer over all pressures with a monodisperse particle size smaller than about 0. 1 μm and an optical depth in the range 0. 002 - 0. 02 at 1 μm provides statistically meaningful solutions for the day/night <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> of HD 189733 b. Generally, we find that a uniform aerosol layer provide adequate fits to the data if the optical depth is less than 0. 1 and the particle size is smaller than 0. 1 μm, irrespective of the atmospheric temperature, planetary radius, aerosol composition, and gaseous molecules. Strong constraints on the aerosol properties are provided by spectra at wavelengths shortward of 1 μm as well as longward of 8 μm, if the aerosol material has absorption features in this region. We show {{that these are the}} optimal wavelengths for quantifying the effects of aerosols, which may guide the design of future space observations. The present investigation indicates that the current data offer sufficient information to constrain some of the aerosol properties of HD 189733 b, but the chemistry in the <b>terminator</b> <b>regions</b> remains uncertain.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that a substantial population of levitated dust {{is present in the}} <b>terminator</b> <b>region</b> of the moon. Stray light scattered by this dust layer may contaminate astronomical observations made from the lunar surface using infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. The evidence for dust levitation stems from: Surveyor vidicon images of horizon glow; anomalous brightness in photographs of the solar corona taken by Apollo astronauts while the spacecraft was just inside the moon's shadow; and observations by Apollo astronauts of streamers just prior to lunar orbital sunrise or just after lunar orbital sunset. It has been proposed that the differential charging of the lunar surface in the <b>terminator</b> <b>region</b> due to photoemission and the consequent strong local electric fields comprise the mechanism responsible for this levitation. Although quantitative data on the levitated lunar dust distribution are meager, it is possible to estimate column densities and sizes. In this paper we summarize the estimates of particulate sizes and number densities of previous authors, and construct a nominal terminator dust distribution, as a function of particulate radius and altitude above the lunar surface. Using the model we estimate the brightness of scattered sunshine for three wavelength bands. For the results in the visible wavelengths, we compare the estimated brightness with the known brightness of selected astronomical objects and discuss the implications for lunar-based astronomy...|$|E
