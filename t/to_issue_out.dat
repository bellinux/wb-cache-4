60|$|As {{they neared}} the village several persons were seen <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> from the gate, and among these {{was a small}} and elderly man, evidently {{the chief of the}} party. His white hair descended to his waist; a boy {{standing}} behind him carried his bow and several javelins. The rest of the men appeared to be unarmed.|$|E
60|$|At half-past six {{groups of}} countrymen were seen, {{making their way}} along the road towards the gate and, {{a quarter of an}} hour later, the troop mounted and formed up, in {{readiness}} <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> as soon as the signal was given; their host placing himself at an upper window, whence he could obtain a view of the city gate.|$|E
60|$|Ernest Mansfeldt did {{his best}} to relieve the town. His son, Count Charles, with five {{thousand}} troops, had been sent into France, but by sweeping up all the garrisons, he moved with a considerable army towards Gertruydenberg and challenged Maurice <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> from his lines to fight him. But the prince had no idea of risking a certain success upon the issue of a battle.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not until}} the 12th of June that Daun, a {{cautious}} and careful general, in accordance with urgent orders from Vienna prepared to advance. His force had now grown to 60,000; 40,000 of the garrison of Prague could be spared, <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> to help him. Frederick had under 70,000, and of these a great portion must remain to guard their siege works. Thus, then, all the advantages lay with the relieving army.|$|E
60|$|Clive's lookout on {{the temple}} of Mansurpet {{perceived}} what was going on, and signalled the news to Clive, who at once set out with his whole force; and, before Law was prepared <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> from Paichandah, Clive was {{within a mile of}} that place. Law might still have fought with a fair chance of success, as he was far stronger than his enemy, but he was again the victim of indecision and want of energy, and, covered by Paichandah, he fell back across the river again.|$|E
60|$|Scenes of {{this kind}} were being enacted {{throughout}} the city. Already the restriction against plundering was disregarded, and although {{the men from the}} counties still abstained from robbery, the released prisoners from the jail and the denizens of the slums of the city had no such scruples, and the houses of the Flemings were everywhere sacked and plundered. The two friends met again at Aldgate. When they reached Tower Hill, it was, they found, occupied by a dense throng of people, who beleaguered the Tower and refused to allow any provisions to be taken in, or any person <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

60|$|But as {{they marched}} in {{disorder}} {{through the narrow}} streets, and were partly dispersed {{for the purpose of}} pillage, a large body of the inhabitants issued suddenly from the town, fell furiously upon them, and made considerable slaughter. De la Marck even availed himself of the breaches in the walls, which permitted the defenders <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> at different points, and, by taking separate routes into the contested suburb, to attack, in the front, flank, and rear at once the assailants, who, stunned by the furious, unexpected, and multiplied nature of the resistance offered, could hardly stand to their arms. The evening, which began to close, added to their confusion.|$|E
60|$|The greater {{portion of}} the men who were to remain behind were to be {{stationed}} on the side on which the sortie was to be made, so as to cover the retreat of the others, by showers of arrows. The rajah's principal officer was placed in command here. His orders were that, if the enemy came on too strongly, he was <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> with a hundred men, and aid the party to beat back their assailants. However, Harry did not think it likely that this would be the case. The Malays would be scattered all over the town--some, perhaps, even beyond the outer palisades--and before they could assemble in force, the party ought to be safe within the palisade again.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{also those}} steams, which seem <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> of the Earth, and {{mix with the}} Air (and so to {{precipitate}} some aqueous Exhalations, wherewith 'tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv'd to shew all the minute variations in {{the pressure of the}} Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in dry weather, but especially when an Eastern Wind (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.|$|E
60|$|This hurry, I say, {{continued}} some weeks, {{that is to}} say, all {{the month}} of May and June, and the more because it was rumoured that an order of the Government was <b>to</b> be <b>issued</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> place turnpikes and barriers {{on the road to}} prevent people travelling, and that the towns on the road would not suffer people from London to pass for fear of bringing the infection along with them, though neither of these rumours had any foundation but in the imagination, especially at-first.|$|R

60|$|The {{task was}} done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed a reward, and {{received}} at least five kisses; which, however, he generously returned. Then {{they came to the}} door, and from their conversation I judged they were about <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> and have a walk on the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.|$|E
6000|$|Then wonder not to {{see this}} soul extend [...] 240 [...] The bounds, and seek some other self, a friend: [...] As {{swelling}} seas to gentle rivers glide, [...] To seek repose, and empty out the tide; [...] So this full soul, in narrow limits pent, [...] Unable to contain her, sought a vent [...] <b>To</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out,</b> and in some friendly breast [...] Discharge her treasures, and securely rest: [...] To unbosom all the secrets of her heart, [...] Take good advice, but better to impart: [...] For 'tis the bliss of friendship's holy state, [...] 250 [...] To mix their minds, and to communicate; [...] Though bodies cannot, souls can penetrate.

60|$|The blow was {{a terrible}} one, and there was great commotion in the town. After {{consultation}} the garrison and the able bodied citizens resolved <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> in a solid column, and to cut {{their way through the}} enemy or perish. It was thought that if the women, the helpless, and infirm alone remained in the city they would be treated with greater mercy after all the fighting men had been slain. But as soon as this resolution became known the women and children issued from the houses with loud cries and tears. The burghers were unable to withstand their entreaties that all should die together, and it was then resolved that the fighting men should be formed into a hollow square, in which the women, children, sick, and aged should be gathered, and so to sally out, and either win a way through the camp or die together.|$|E

60|$|The {{characters}} {{of the two men}} were in complete contrast with each other--the one was ardent, passionate, prompt in action and swift in execution; the other, though equally brave, was prudent and careful, anxious above all things to accomplish his object with the smallest possible loss of men, while Enghien risked the lives of his soldiers as recklessly as his own. They always acted together in the most perfect harmony, and their friendship remained unimpaired even when in subsequent days they stood in arms against each other. At the council Turenne was in favour of making a circuit and taking up their post in the valley of St. Pierre, by which they would intercept the Bavarians' communications and force them by famine <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> from their strong lines and fight in the open, and urged that to attack a position so strongly fortified would entail terrible loss, even if successful.|$|E

"Rem acu, once again," [...] said Sir Piercie; and {{not without}} good cause, since my neck, if I remained, {{might have been}} brought within the {{circumstances}} of a halter--and so speedy was my journey northward, that I had but time to exchange my peach-coloured doublet of Genoa velvet, thickly laid over with goldsmith's work, for this cuirass, which was made by Bonamico of Milan, and travelled northward with all speed, judging that I might do well to visit my Right Honourable Cousin of Northumberland, {{at one of his}} numerous castles. But as I posted towards Alnwick, even with the speed of a star, which, darting from its native sphere, shoots wildly downwards, I was met at Northallerton by one Henry Vaughan, a servant of my right honourable kinsman, who showed me, that as then I might not with safety come to his presence, seeing that, in obedience to orders from his court, he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>out</b> letters for my incarceration." ...|$|E
