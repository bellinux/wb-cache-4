5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E

5|$|As {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many gameplay similarities with its predecessor and runs on a upgraded {{version of its}} engine. The game features a single-player mode <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> players to complete a series of missions under certain difficulty settings. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings. Perfect Dark was developed {{over the course of}} three years and is technically one of the most advanced games for the Nintendo 64, offering an optional high resolution graphics mode, widescreen support, and Dolby's surround sound. A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game's single-player mode and most of the multiplayer features.|$|E
5|$|Blitzball is a minigame <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> {{strategy}} and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E

Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E

This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> this energy to separate.|$|E

In the third season, Quinn intends to get full custody of her daughter, Beth, and her attempts to prove Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—the adoptive mother of Beth—an unfit mother fail; eventually, she realizes that Shelby is Beth's true mother. Quinn subsequently receives a college acceptance letter from Yale, and while driving to Finn and Rachel's wedding, her car is struck by a truck and she suffers a spinal injury <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> her to use a wheelchair for many weeks.

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'.

Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E
