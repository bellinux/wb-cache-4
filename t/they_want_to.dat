A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves {{can go to the}} ball faster.|$|E

60|$|The misguided {{young men}} who thus shirked their duty to the {{mistress}} from whom they had received many favours, were actuated by the low idea of making a perfectly idle trip, in any direction.

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be their leaders, who <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E

The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate goodness of the child.|$|E
