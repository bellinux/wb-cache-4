5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> The saga then continues.|$|E

50|$|Two {{days after}} the murders, on Sunday, October 18, 1931, Judd, {{with her left hand}} bandaged from a gunshot wound, boarded the Golden State Limited {{passenger}} train from Phoenix's Union Station, along with <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> and luggage containing the bodies. Judd traveled overnight to Los Angeles. Upon her arrival at 7:45 am the next morning, <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> immediately came under suspicion because of the foul odor detected by station personnel as well as fluids escaping from <b>the</b> <b>trunks.</b> Thinking at first <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> contained contraband such as a dead deer, the baggage agent, Arthur V. Anderson, wanted <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> opened and tagged them to be held. He asked Judd for the key, but she stated she didn't have it with her.|$|R
5000|$|Upon their release, <b>the</b> <b>Trunks</b> earned {{critical}} {{praise from}} several publications, and were termed [...] "The Cure for Boardshort Rash" [...] by Daily Stoke, and [...] "Surf Specific Compression Shorts...Verdict: Recommended" [...] by Tracks Magazine. <b>The</b> <b>Trunks</b> also received praise from Thrillist, AWSM.com, Surfboard Shack, and TRND Collective.

5|$|Keith {{brings his}} {{findings}} {{on the death of}} Cyrus to Sheriff Lamb and provides an alternate explanation; that the Dean had discovered his wife was having an affair. Lamb agrees with him that it was a murder. Lamb calls Mindy O'Dell, the dean's wife and a main suspect, to his office. Logan, Veronica's on-again, off-again boyfriend, visits Veronica in her cell and they are civil to each other. After being released from jail, Veronica is stopped on the street by Josh, who has Mason (Robert Ri'chard) in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of his car, frantically telling Veronica that Mason is the culprit. When Veronica disproves this claim, she tells Josh to call her using a disposable phone within 24 hours. Veronica releases Mason from <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|E

5|$|The age of {{the tree}} was {{determined}} by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected from under the tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. <b>The</b> <b>trunk</b> itself {{is estimated to be}} only a few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk).|$|E

5|$|The next {{electrification}} {{occurred on}} <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Line from OsloØ to Lillestrøm on 1 September 1927, the Randsfjord Line from Drammen to Kongsberg on 10 April 1929 and the Drammen Line from Drammen to Brakerøya on 6 May 1930. El 5 locomotives were acquired for <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Line. Electric multiple units {{were put into}} service in 1931, with the delivery of four Class 62 units on the route from OsloV to Sandvika. These proved not to be sufficiently powerful for the large traffic and were later moved to less used services from OsloV to Asker or Heggedal. The class remained on the commuter rail service until 1953.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trunk</b> of Dinocephalosaurus has {{at least}} 26 {{vertebrae}}. In Dinocephalosaurus, {{there appear to be}} no lumbar vertebrae, or vertebrae of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> lacking ribs. The ribs of the sacrum and tail also {{do not appear to be}} fused to their corresponding vertebrae. Each of the gastralia in Dinocephalosaurus is composed of three elements instead of four as in Tanystropheus; they differ in that Dinocephalosaurus only has one element on the midline, while Tanystropheus has two elements that combine to form a midline bar.|$|E

5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, {{there seems to be}} no substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Guttate {{psoriasis}} {{is characterized}} by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous spots of psoriasis appear over {{large areas of the}} body, primarily <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is often triggered by a streptococcal infection, typically streptococcal pharyngitis. The reverse is not true.|$|E
50|$|Nearing {{bankruptcy}} in 1919, {{the entire system}} was nationalized. In 1923 the government merged <b>the</b> Grand <b>Trunk,</b> <b>the</b> Grand <b>Trunk</b> Pacific, <b>the</b> Canadian Northern and the National Transcontinental lines into the new Canadian National Railways. <b>The</b> Grand <b>Trunk</b> lines, however, kept its distinctive name.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of the body.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 700-year-old oak tree, {{called the}} Domesday Oak, was {{selected}} by The Tree Council as one of 50 Great British Trees.

5|$|In west Serbia's {{region of}} Rađevina, {{centered}} on the town of Krupanj, the badnjak prepared for each household is cut into three logs, {{the most important of}} which is the dozemak—the log that comes from the part of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> that grew nearest to the ground. In Resava, Levač, Temnić, and Jadar of Serbia, as well as in Ozren and Romanija of Bosnia, the badnjak is cut into three logs associated respectively with the men, the women, and the children.|$|E
5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located directly under <b>the</b> <b>trunk.</b> The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved {{and the only}} well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E
5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E
