40|$|The axiom of weak {{disposability}} {{is frequently}} imposed in {{data envelopment analysis}} (DEA) models involving undesirable outputs such as pollution. This paper sheds new light on <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> interpretation of <b>weak</b> disposability by developing dual formulations of the weakly disposable DEA technology. We find that <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> implications of <b>weak</b> disposability on the multiplier DEA problem are two-fold: (1) the shadow prices of the undesirable outputs can be positive or negative, and (2) <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> loss of <b>the</b> benchmark cannot exceed the suck cost of the inputs. We interpret the second implications as a limited liability condition. The dual formulations developed in this paper enable one to estimate shadow prices of the undesirable outputs using the weakly disposable technology. The insights gained are illustrated by a numerical example and an empirical application to the US power plants. DEA Efficiency Environmental studies Resource management...|$|R

On the other hand, excessive rigidity may inhibit tariff negotiations or induce governments to set inefficiently high tariffs, as strict regulations would reduce policy makers' ability to use subsidies to offset domestic market distortions. Efficient subsidy rules are, therefore, the ones that strike the right balance between policy flexibility and rigidity. This economic approach provides a framework to interpret the provisions on domestic subsidies in the WTO...|$|R
