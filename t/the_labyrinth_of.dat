5|$|Belgicas voyage {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of {{what became known as the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and was rapidly followed by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the Northwest Passage, the then-uncharted sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific through <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> north Canadian islands. Having earned his master's ticket, Amundsen acquired a small sloop, Gjøa, which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway, the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six. The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered. At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national hero, in the first rank of polar explorers.|$|E
5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that the militants must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants inside were armed with guns and rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and explosion-proof vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of the militants detonated a suicide jacket, killing everyone in the room.. It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E

A number of theories exist for why it occurs including constrictions in blood vessels, viral infections, and autoimmune reactions. About 10% of cases run in families.

25|$|Several predators {{dwell in}} <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> channels, {{branches}} and roots that poke {{up into the}} air. This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (axis axis), Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and even rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is estimated {{that there are now}} 180 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30–100 per year.|$|E
25|$|Varying {{vestibular}} system stimulation has {{an effect}} on place cells. The vestibular system, part of <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> the inner ear, {{plays an important role in}} spatial memory by tuning into self-motion such as acceleration. Bilateral lesions of the vestibular system in patients cause abnormal firing of hippocampal place cells as evidenced, in part, by difficulties with aforementioned spatial tasks such as the radial arm maze and the Morris water navigation task. The dysfunction in spatial memory seen with damage to the vestibular system is lasting and possibly permanent, particularly if there is bilateral damage. For example, spatial memory deficits of patients with chronic vestibular loss is seen 5–10 years after a complete loss of the bilateral vestibular labyrinths.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, M. E. Lamb {{suggested}} that the play may have borrowed {{an aspect of the}} ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into <b>the</b> <b>Labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> the Minotaur. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for Elizabethans the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes Ariadne's thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, Daedalus. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.|$|E

500|$|The General in His Labyrinth (original Spanish title: [...] ) is a {{novel by}} the Colombian writer and Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez. It is a fictionalized account of {{the last days of}} Simón Bolívar, liberator and leader of Gran Colombia. First {{published}} in 1989, the book traces Bolívar's final journey from Bogotá to the Caribbean coastline of Colombia in his attempt to leave South America for exile in Europe. In this dictator novel about a continental hero, [...] "despair, sickness, and death inevitably win out over love, health, and life". Breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of Bolívar , García Márquez depicts a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted. The story explores <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> Bolívar's life through the narrative of his memories.|$|E
500|$|According to {{literary}} critic David Danow, <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> <b>of</b> the novel's title refers to [...] "a series of labyrinths that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography... that consistently and conclusively {{result in a}} dead end"—in this case, the General's own death. His final voyage along the Magdalena River involves a doubling {{back and forth from}} one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere. The labyrinth does not lead to happiness; instead, it results in madness from constant pondering on the past and an impossible future. At the end of his life, the General is reduced to a spectre of his former self. The labyrinth also recalls the labyrinth built to imprison the minotaur in Greek mythology, and the endless travelling and searching of ancient Greek heroes. In Danow's view, [...] "The Labyrinth mirrors the wanderings and travails of the hero in search for meaning and resolution to the vicissitudes of life".|$|E
