5|$|The niches in {{the lowest}} zone of the gable contain nine angels, of which Cockerell {{identifies}} Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. In the next zone are the taller figures of the twelve apostles, some, such as John, Andrew and Bartholomew, clearly identifiable by the attributes that they carry. The uppermost niches of the gable contained the figure of Christ the Judge at the centre, with <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> Mary on his right and John the Baptist on his left. The figures all suffered from iconoclasm. A new statue of Jesus was carved for the central niche, but the two side niches now contain cherubim. Christ and <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> Mary are also represented by now headless figures in a Coronation of <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> in a niche above the central portal.

5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as <b>The</b> <b>Virgin</b> and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for <b>The</b> <b>Virgin</b> of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of <b>The</b> <b>Virgin</b> and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to <b>The</b> <b>Virgin</b> and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that <b>the</b> <b>Virgin</b> River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E

The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols.|$|E
