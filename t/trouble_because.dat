Kertész was not permitted to photograph outdoors or to have any project related to national security. Trying to avoid <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> Elizabeth had started a cosmetics company (Cosmia Laboratories), Kertész ceased to do commissioned work and essentially disappeared from the photographic world for three years.|$|E
5|$|Violence peaked {{the next}} evening, {{the night of}} September 10–11. Businesses were better prepared. Some had boarded up and others stayed open all night with armed guards visible to {{discourage}} thieves {{taking advantage of the}} strike. Gamblers played dice in open view, and women had their handbags snatched. But the Guard's inexperience at handling crowds resulted in dangerous attempts to assert control. Gunfire in South Boston left two dead and others wounded. One person died in a riot at Scollay Square, a center of amusement halls and theaters. Whether the crowds were threatening property or making <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> they were in sympathy with the strikers is unknown. The death total ultimately reached nine.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

To counteract this downturn in listeners to Jazz FM, from 1998, Wheatly introduced more varied jazz into the daytime playlists. From February 1998, smooth jazz and soul music were more integrated into the core playlist of Jazz FM.|$|E

Citroën was in financial <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> it developed too many radical new models for its financial resources. Some of them, notably the Citroën SM and the Comotor Wankel engine venture proved unprofitable. Others, the Citroën CX and Citroën GS for example, proved very successful in the marketplace.|$|E

And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|Jourdan's {{left wing}} was in serious <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> {{it had to}} retreat through Altenkirchen. This place was nearer to the archduke's Austrians {{than it was to}} the French left wing. Fortunately for Jourdan, Marceau and Bernadotte capably held off the Austrian advance guards long enough for the French left wing to barely get away. Meanwhile, Castelverd withdrew into Neuwied's {{bridgehead}} where his troops were secure behind prepared fortifications. On 19 September, as the last French columns were still filing through Altenkirchen, Jourdan ordered Marceau to hold on a little longer with Poncet's division. During the fighting Marceau was fatally hit by a bullet and died early the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Bastion Properties was in <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> of {{building}} costs and an unsatisfactory building manager. After rapid expansion, Heseltine's businesses were badly {{hit by the}} Selwyn Lloyd financial squeeze of 1961 and, still not yet thirty years old, he would eventually owe £250,000 (around £4.5 million at 2016 prices). He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine joked about how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E

25|$|In <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> {{he lacked}} the means to live decently, and because his lack of a {{university}} degree meant he could not become a lawyer or a professor, Rosetti sought a professional job relatively safe from the vicissitudes of politics. At the time, the Foreign Affairs Ministry formed one such oasis. He applied there, and in April 1898, when Sturdza was both Prime and Foreign Minister, he was hired as the archivist's assistant, again helped by Bianu. His other supporter was Gheorghe Văsescu, {{a friend of the}} PNL factional leader Ion I. C. Brătianu. Although this new job was low in the ministerial hierarchy, his fluent knowledge of several languages (itself a precondition for working in the ministry) and his penchant for historical exegesis helped Rosetti advance. Nevertheless, the promotions came with a humiliating slowness and, with a wife, three sons and a daughter to support, he found the salary insufficient. Although the Conservatives returned to power in 1899, their new leader was Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino—Rosetti's patron, Catargiu, died suddenly the same year, leaving him virtually without friends in the party.|$|E
25|$|His {{involvement}} with Catholicism {{took on a}} new dimension in the 1580s. Following Pope Pius V's papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, in 1570, which absolved Elizabeth's subjects from allegiance to her and effectively made her an outlaw {{in the eyes of}} the Catholic Church, Catholicism became increasingly identified with sedition {{in the eyes of the}} Tudor authorities. With the influx of missionary priests trained at the English College, Douai, (now in France but then part of the Spanish Netherlands) and in Rome from the 1570s onwards, relations between the authorities and the Catholic community took a further turn for the worse. Byrd himself is found in the company of prominent Catholics. In 1583 he got into serious <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> of his association with Paget, who was suspected of involvement in the Throckmorton Plot, and for sending money to Catholics abroad. As a result of this, Byrd's membership of the Chapel Royal was apparently suspended for a time, restrictions were placed on his movements, and his house was placed on the search list. In 1586 he attended a gathering at a country house in the company of Father Henry Garnett (later executed for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot) and the Catholic poet Robert Southwell.|$|E
25|$|In 200, {{when the}} forces of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were locked in a {{stalemate}} at the Battle of Guandu, Yuan sent Liu Bei with an army to support the rebellions against Cao Cao in Yinjiang (氵隱疆; southwest of present-day Xuchang, Henan), roughly 8.3km south of the capital. Cao Cao became worried about such developments in the territories under his control, so he sent Cao Ren to suppress the uprisings. Cao Ren observed that the rebels dared to create <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> they had Liu Bei's support, but the men under Liu were newly recruited and inexperienced, {{so it was not}} difficult to defeat them. Cao Ren targeted the rebel chief Liu Pi and killed him in battle, and subsequently defeated Liu Bei as well. Yuan Shao attempted to cut off Cao Cao's route to the west by sending Han Meng (韓猛) southwest. Cao Ren responded to the threat by defeating Han Meng at Jiluo Hill (雞洛山; located 50 li northeast of present-day Xinmi, Henan). Yuan Shao became afraid and did not dare to send out his troops. Cao Ren and Shi Huan (史渙) later led a force to attack a convoy transporting supplies to Yuan Shao's camp and destroyed the food supplies.|$|E

500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{released}} its debut album, Tell All Your Friends, in March 2002 and {{spent most of}} the year and 2003 touring.

Going from being home... to being gone all the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle." [...] The group briefly considered breaking up. Guitarist Eddie Reyes contacted his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's spot; bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with drummer Mark O'Connell, then joined the group.

500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with Howard Stern, Rollins {{was asked about}} rumors that he had Joe Cole's brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin – who was {{a fan of the}} Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album, The End of Silence, and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> of the implication that {{they had a lot of}} money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: [...] "My place is going to get popped." ...|$|E

In early May, the group issued a statement, explaining that [...] "There have {{been a series of}} personal events with members of the band ... We need very much {{to take a step back}} at this time". Around this time, Nolan (citing exhaustion from touring) left the band, and Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were [...] "having <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> everything was happening so fast.

500|$|Century Falls is conceptually much {{darker than}} its {{predecessor}} Dark Season and his later work, which Davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers [...] "get off on the dark stuff": in a BAFTA interview with Davies, Home recalled that she [...] "very nearly got into <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> it did actually push at the boundaries which some of the powers-that-be would rather not have been pushed"; and a Daily Mail review of the series considered the show's themes of arson, black magic, and communal fear as being [...] "on a scale normally reserved for peak-time adult viewing". The series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist, who is not heroic and aspirational, has poor social skills, and is bluntly described by Ben as a [...] "fat girl", a practice that the Daily Mail praised as [...] "something that defies the Thought Police". Century Falls was the last script he wrote for the BBC's children's department for fourteen years. He had begun to formulate another successor: The Heat of the Sun, a series set over Christmas 1999 and New Year's Day 2000 that would have included the concepts of psychic powers and world domination.|$|E

This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry.
