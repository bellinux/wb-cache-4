This information would also be useful for future construction of virtual pruned logs in a sawing simulator. A sawn <b>timber</b> <b>conversion</b> percentage (proportion of sawn timber volume to log volume) was calculated for each log and mathematical relationships were defined for SED, Conversion Potential (CP) factor, PLI, heartwood content and percentage of dead and rotten branches.|$|E
40|$|Despite much of {{the forests}} being cleared in advance of {{agricultural}} expansion, areas of oak woodland have been managed as a valuable resource passed on {{from one generation to}} the next. The longevity of oak trees has required long term planning and an ability to forecast the demand of great grandchildren and beyond. Depending on circumstances, this management would have happened historically within family groups, or perhaps on a communal basis as part of the feudal system. Prior to the 1840 s and the introduction of rotating “circular” saws, saw mills exclusively used a vertical movement for converting the trees into timber. Saw mills were traditionally powered by water, with the rotary motion of the wheel being transferred via a crank shaft to a rip-saw blade mounted in a vertical wooden frame known as a sash.

40|$|It can {{be argued}} that the major episodes of {{technological}} change in shipbuilding and seafaring between the late medieval period and the mid 17 th century in Europe are directly related to similarly fundamental changes in society that move Europe from medievalism to modernity. Indeed it is in these correlations that we find explanations for what have often been treated as insoluble technical ‘mysteries’ such as the clinker to carvel transition, as well as the subsequent changes in <b>timber</b> <b>conversion,</b> hull form, construction and rig in the late 16 th century. But were other factors also at work? This paper begins by reviewing the clinker to carvel change in the light of contemporary power politics as well considering transformative phenomena over which the dynastic competitors of early Europe had no control. And if we can correlate technological change with society at large, what about changes in the communities who conceptualized, designed, built, sailed and sometimes lost the ships that developed Europe’s global network? It is here we see new expressions of maritime identity and new perceptions of maritime space. <br/...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{historically}} proven elements of timber harvesting planning is determining the amount of each roundwood - assortment, which defines the expected volume and quality of timber that will {{be obtained from the}} still standing forest stand intended for harvesting. Assortment proposal goes out from terrain measuring, and the resulting assortment is, after adjustments caused by the market opportunities, the basis for the felling projects. The volume and quality of timber in the stand depends on a number of factors that affected the forest {{at the time of its}} evolution, but especially during its silvicultural treatments. The assortment of the stand is largely influenced by the forest segmentation while thinning when the light profit, changing of the precipitation regime, damaging the roots by machines, soil compaction and others, affect both the volume and quality of wood close to the striproads. A higher proportion of striproads correlate with a higher proportion of trees which are affected in this way. This has a negative impact on the economy, because it can be assumed that the reduced quality of timber will even lower the conversion of harvested timber. Therefore, the work aims to assess the extent how the choice of accessing can affect the <b>timber</b> <b>conversion...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} sawing system, which simulated {{a multiple}} saw edger, {{was used to}} investigate the effect of log rotation on the timber conversions of swept logs of three size-classes. A sample of 100 logs was stratified with respect to both log size and sweep, and four sawing methods (half-taper live sawing, half-taper cant sawing, offset live sawing, and offset cant sawing) were applied with the computer sawing simulation system AUTOS AW to each log at 37 positions representing rotation at 10 ° intervals from 0 ° (equivalent to the "sweep up " position) to 360 ° inclusive. All 14 800 simulations used the same carriage configuration, saw kerfs, and target dimensions, and the <b>timber</b> <b>conversion</b> percentage was determined for each. The results suggest that, under the conditions selected for the simulations, any log rotation {{can be used with}} half-taper cant sawing without sacrifice of substantial volume, but rotation is more important with offset cant sawing. Increased conversions were obtained when the log rotation was approximately 145 °, i. e., midway between the "sweep in " and "sweep down " positions. For every angle, half-taper sawing obtained conversions that were at least equal to, if not greater than, those obtained with offset sawing. Results were consistent with the general rule of thumb that each 0. 1 increase in the sweep:diameter ratio (deviation: s. e. d.) leads to a 5 % decrease in timber recovery...|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{ecosystem}} services {{that may be}} provided more efficiently in forests managed under alternative silvicultural approaches, e.g., visual quality, hydrological services, or wildlife habitat provision, are not necessarily adequately monetized or evaluated (e.g., Ribe 1999; Daniel 2001). Whether or not such values compensate for a potential loss in <b>timber</b> production after <b>conversion</b> to alternative silviculture regimes will vary with the specific situation and assumptions, e.g., soil quality and interest rates, respectively (Amsalu et al. 2014). In many situations, the application of alternative silviculture would only be economically viable through measures such as conservation payments (Cubbage et al. 2007), monetary incentives as part of forest certification efforts (Nasi et al. 2011), or direct payments for {{ecosystem services}} (Wunder 2006), such as water supply and regulation (Nahuelhual et al. 2007).|$|R

Much of the giant thicket rat's range lies within Mount Kenya National Park but it is a priority to establish other protected areas for this species. The giant thicket rat is classified as endangered because its range is less than 2,000 km2 and is in a single locality where the habitat is being degraded. As this species is so little known the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources recommends that it needs further study to evaluate its status and ensure its conservation.|$|R
40|$|Mangroves {{are found}} {{throughout}} the tropics, providing critical ecosystem goods and services to coastal communities and supporting rich biodiversity. Despite their value, world-wide, mangroves are being rapidly degraded and deforested. Madagascar contains approximately 2 % of the world’s mangroves, > 20 % {{of which has been}} deforested since 1990 from increased extraction for charcoal and <b>timber</b> and <b>conversion</b> to small to large-scale agriculture and aquaculture. Loss is particularly prominent in the northwestern Ambaro and Ambanja bays. Here, we focus on Ambaro and Ambanja bays, presenting dynamics calculated using United States Geological Survey (USGS) national-level mangrove maps and the first localized satellite imagery derived map of dominant land-cover types. The analysis of USGS data indicated a loss of 7659 ha (23. 7 %) and a gain of 995 ha (3. 1 %) from 1990 – 2010. Contemporary mapping results were 93. 4 % accurate overall (Kappa 0. 9), with producer’s and user’s accuracies ≥ 85 %. Classification results allowed partitioning mangroves in to ecologically meaningful, spectrally distinct strata, wherein field measurements facilitated estimating the first total carbon stocks for mangroves in Madagascar. Estimates suggest that higher stature closed-canopy mangroves have average total vegetation carbon values of 146. 8 Mg/ha (± 10. 2) and soil organic carbon of 446. 2 (± 36. 9), supporting a growing body of studies that mangroves are amongst the most carbon-dense tropical forests...|$|R
40|$|A New Zealand {{stand of}} Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden was pruned up to height 8 m and grown for 15 years at low {{stocking}} to 57 cm diameter at breast height. This stand provided 15 trees, preselected {{for a range}} of wood density. Lumber and veneer were cut from the 5 -m butt logs, veneer was peeled from the second logs from height 7 to 13 m, and each tree was evaluated for production of appearance-grade lumber and rotary-peeled veneer. Butt-log quality was good as pruning had effectively restricted the knotty core, and there was little decay from branches in either butt logs or veneer billets. Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing <b>timber</b> <b>conversion</b> in some trees. Collapse and internal checking were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated splitting. Knots severely downgraded structural plywood veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the second logs being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned butt logs. Stiffness of veneer sheets was successfully measured using a sonic device (Pundit™) to sort veneers for manufacture of laminated veneer lumber...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{forestry}} in Indonesia {{is facing}} challenges {{in terms of}} sustainability and the survival of its inhabitant, indigenous people, not least because the perception of policymakers is that, since the 1970 s, forests have provided a major solution to economic development by producing <b>timber,</b> <b>conversion</b> forest land for agriculture, mining, and other non-forest land use. Consequently, the forest and its resources have been undervalued and its monetary potential has been underestimated. This has led to overexploitation and conversion, which ultimately results {{in the loss of}} biodiversity and threatens the survival of indigenous people. This study, conducted in a small forest protection area in Gunung Lumut in the Pasir District of East Kalimantan, focuses on the poor indigenous people in this region and reveals the crucial role that the forest plays in both the economic and non-economic dimensions of the lives of the indigenous people of Paser. Indeed, the forest contributes to the Paser household economy in almost all aspects of life. Forests are so much more than trees and timber, and the Gunung Lumut protection forest goes far beyond providing food and materials for construction. It is the backdrop for the Paser people’s spirits and cosmovision. This study suggests that conversion or other land use options for forest land should begin with an evaluation process, in order to reveal the ‘true’ value of the forest – economically and environmentally – for the livelihoods of indigenous people. These values must be part of the toolkit for developing policies for land and forest use. In addition, such an evaluation process boosts the negotiating capacity of the indigenous people to prevent further losses from forest conversion. This study shows that monetary valuation also benefits forest management by preventing unnecessary conversion of forest land and further loss of biodiversity in tropical forests. It provides indigenous people with a bargaining tool in the context of compensation for the loss of their resources. Promotor: G. A. Persoon, Co-promotor: H. H. de IonghWith summary in Dutc...|$|E

40|$|There are {{significant}} commercial forestry activities in Botswana and in Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwean operations include large- scale production, milling, and secondary <b>conversion</b> of <b>timber.</b> Technologies used in all these operations are basically traditional but generally satisfactory with respect to reliability and with respect to meeting market product specifications. In general, the industry in both countries takes a positive view to emerging technologies and attempts to keep abreast with developments in this area. The industry is, however, cautious about adopting these technologies. This caution derives mostly from the apparent satisfactory operations from the current technologies and from some fear of possible difficulties which may arise with respect to indigenizing these technologies once adopted. Besides these considerations, capacity exists for Zimbabwe particularly to engage some of these technologies.

40|$|The {{extinction}} risk {{among the}} terrestrial vertebrates of Southeast Asia, including Indo-Burma and archipelagic regions such as Philippines, Sundaland and Wallacea {{is among the}} highest in the world. The basis for this elevated risk in recent times is largely due to the clearing of forest habitat and subsequent conversion to plantations or human settlements where a significant fraction of vertebrate species are endemic. Among a total of 500 terrestrial species of birds (including inland species that occupy riparian habitats) found in Peninsular Malaysia, 156 are endemic to the Sundaland (Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo and smaller island west of the Wallace Line) of which 82 (53 %) are now red-listed by IUCN. Lowland forests, primarily the dipterocarp rainforests (as represented by the Pasoh Reserve Forest) have undergone the most extensive shrinkage of their former area; hence they carry the highest risk of extinction of biota. Continued expropriation of <b>timber</b> and <b>conversion</b> to plantation agroforestry will further fragment these forests and reduce the likelihood that fully functioning ecosystems can regenerate. We discuss a strategy to identify what remains of primary lowland forests in Peninsular Malaysia, especially patches of forest with adequate area to support viable populations of species as a functional community and to overcome the likelihood of loss through stochastic events. Stimulation of a competitive industry with the oil palm industry that maintains intact natural forest would bolster the security of the rainforest from an economic perspective...|$|R

It also examines the potential for MIFEE to meet sustainability requirements under RSPO, ISPO, and FSC. The plantation development plans are characterized {{by a lack of}} reliable official data and limited public disclosure. The available information paints a skewed picture of expected outcomes, where short-term economic benefits from forest clearing dominate and environmental impacts and social implications appear to be underestimated. Our analysis indicates that oil palm concessions under MIFEE can be RSPO compliant if they resist the short term windfall profits from <b>conversion</b> <b>timber.</b> ISPO certification is possible without any major overhaul. On the other hand, FSC certification for timber concessions is not possible. Because MIFEE plantation program is dominated by timber plantations, they weigh heavily on the program's poor sustainability prospects.

40|$|Much of {{mainland}} Southeast Asia's {{primary forest}} {{has been converted}} into secondary vegetation types {{in the past several}} decades. In the Lower Mekong Subregion, nearly 100 million ha of forest were significantly altered or removed, with depletion in terms of areal percent most severe in Thailand and Vietnam. <b>Timber</b> extraction and <b>conversion</b> of forestland to agriculture are the two principal causes of forest degradation in the region. Logged sites are often later occupied by migrant homesteaders. The current regional focus of logging has shifted to Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. Secondary forests, despite their frequently degraded status, continue to play direct and supportive roles with respect to socioeconomic development. Widespread removal of primary forests has made secondary forests the principal source of supplemental livelihood products for millions of poor rural households. Given the critical role of forests in supporting sustainable development, regional governments and a range of non government, research and donor organisations are exploring, developing and supporting strategies for reforestation and natural forest regeneration.

40|$|The agrosilvicultural (agroforestry) {{farming system}} in Mt.

It is a case of land sharing between trees and crops. Interestingly, farmers in Mt. Kilimanjaro intend to achieve cost savings (economies of scope, synergy effect) not through temporal sharing (double cropping, relay cropping) or horizontal space sharing (inter cropping), but through vertical space sharing. The agrosilvopastral farming system, which combines agroforestry and livestock raising, helps maintain soil fertility and reproduction within the management entity by means of integrated farming with livestock. It also promotes income growth (cost reduction→profit maximization) through the intensive use of family labor and selfsupply.

40|$|This {{presentation}} discusses {{a collaborative}} project to develop, test, and demonstrate baldcypress forest mapping and monitoring products for aiding forest conservation and restoration in coastal Louisiana. Low lying coastal {{forests in the}} region are being negatively impacted by multiple factors, including subsidence, salt water intrusion, sea level rise, persistent flooding, hydrologic modification, annual insect-induced forest defoliation, <b>timber</b> harvesting, and <b>conversion</b> to urban land uses. Coastal baldcypress forests provide invaluable ecological services in terms of wildlife habitat, forest products, storm buffers, and water quality benefits. Before this project, current maps of baldcypress forest concentrations and change did not exist or were out of date. In response, this project was initiated to produce: 1) current maps showing the extent and location of baldcypress dominated forests; and 2) wetland forest change maps showing temporary and persistent disturbance and loss since the early 1970 s. Project products are being developed collaboratively with multiple state and federal agencies. Products are being validated using available reference data from aerial, satellite, and field survey data. Results include Landsat TM- based classifications of baldcypress in terms of cover type and percent canopy cover. Landsat MSS data was employed to compute a circa 1972 classification of swamp and bottomland hardwood forest types. Landsat data for 1972 - 2010 was used to compute wetland forest change products.

40|$|Abstract: Factors {{that control}} the {{stability}} of mountain slopes {{may be in a}} tenuous state of equilibrium that can easily be upset by <b>timber</b> harvesting, vegetation <b>conversion,</b> and road construction. Shallow, rapid landslides are the dominant erosion and sediment delivery mechanisms in much of the steep terrain worldwide, especially where rainfall is high. Deep and dense tree root systems often contribute the additional component of soil shear strength necessary to insure long term stability of steep slopes. Road and foot paths may redistribute water onto marginally stable hillsides or hollows, promoting slope failure. Here we present a distributed shallow landslide model that captures the temporal dynamics of imposed management scenarios at the catchment scale. This physically-based model incorporates a planar infinite slope analysis module (based on factor of safety analysis), a kinematic wave groundwater module, and a module for continuous temporal changes in root cohesion and vegetation surcharge. The distributed landslide model is integrated with GIS and a topographic analysis, which partitions the basin into vector-based stream tube elements. Recent developments include evaluations of complex timber harvesting scenarios and assessing the effects of rainfall characteristics on landslide potential. Examples are presented showing the application of this landslide model to temporal scenarios of vegetation management in steep catchments. Benefits of using longer forest harvesting rotations are shown in a steep catchment on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Potential applications of the model are discussed in managed tropical catchments where forest conversion may increase landslide potential. A major drawback of such distributed models is that they require rather intensive data inputs and are thus difficult to apply in remote areas...|$|R
40|$|After {{centuries of}} <b>timber</b> harvest and <b>conversion</b> of forest to {{farmland}} and development, only small pockets of old growth forest {{remain in the}} eastern United States. These remnant portions of older forest have intrinsic value as a rare forest type and they play an important ecological function on the landscape. However, old growth forests in the eastern U. S. are less well-studied and documented {{than their counterparts in}} the Pacific Northwest. This study was undertaken to predict the geographic location, ecological and spectral characteristics of existing old growth, specifically in the southern Appalachian forests of western North Carolina. Stands of old growth previously field validated by the Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition were used as the response variable. Predictor variables included a range of landscape, topographic, and satellite indices derived from Landsat TM 7 satellite imagery and terrain analysis. Predictions were made using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling techniques. Model results were successful based on validation with existing field data. However, the MaxEnt model produced the most realistic estimate of potential old growth area given the inherent rarity of this forest type and suitability of the MaxEnt modeling technique for predicting the distribution of rare species. Results highlight over 54, 000 hectares of potential old growth to be investigated by researchers on the ground. This analysis will contribute to the relatively limited body of knowledge about old growth in the eastern U. S. and is unique in terms of its broad geographic extent. Continued research on these remnant eastern old growth stands must be done to increase our understanding of this rare forest stage and to better inform related management decisions on both public and private land in the eastern U.

40|$|ABSTRACT In the {{assessment}} of timber structures, diagnostic investigations of the structural members and connections are generally necessary. The assessment often requires appropriate non-destructive testing (NDT) and semi-destructive testing (SDT) techniques. Improved, new methods based on scientific knowledge and guidelines are needed for their application, so the principal goal of the project is to develop guidelines and recommendations on how to perform assessment of existing timber structures with reference to their condition and structural capability, as well as assessment strategies. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the research focused on the development of an X-ray image calibration procedure, which enables the determination of density properties for the in-situ assessment of timber structures. This non-destructive method is useful for evaluating the internal condition, since wood density has a strong relationship with several mechanical properties. An X-ray procedure to calibrate for the influence of significant density differences in wood specimens, thickness and moisture was applied, which the images were analysed and evaluated. Finally, a calibration wedge was set up to verify the procedure on timber beam specimens, resulting in good agreement and an average accuracy of ~ 97 %. The values obtained from the image calibration resulted in very good linear correlation between the measured density and the greyscale from X-ray images. The main advantage compared with conventional techniques is the detection and quantification of the internal condition of timber that may reduce the mechanical properties of the structure. This study shows good potential when it comes to the development of a viable tool for in-situ assessments of timber structures and could be used indirectly in analyses of structural behaviour. In the second part, the research focused on a systematic in-situ assessment strategy of the Vasa warship, including the prediction of the density, the stiffness properties and the influence of PEG (Poly Ethylene Glycol). This was made possible by combining non-destructive in-situ testing techniques, particularly X-ray, with mechanical and chemical tests. A global non-destructive assessment of the mechanical properties is needed to predict both the strength and stiffness of the Vasa oak. The proposed procedure can be used in situ with satisfactory results for the evaluation of <b>timber</b> properties. A <b>conversion</b> of a three-dimensional ship model from the Vasa warship to model the real structural behaviour might create difficulties due to the complexity of the material properties that are needed for input. The PEG content clearly has a negative influence on the strength and stiffness properties. Satisfactory agreement between the density and stiffness properties was reached through cross-correlation to PEG content.
