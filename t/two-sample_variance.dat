50|$|To {{address these}} problems, David Allan {{introduced}} the M-sample variance and (indirectly) the <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance.</b> While the <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance</b> did not completely allow {{all types of}} noise to be distinguished, it provided a means to meaningfully separate many noise-forms for time-series of phase or frequency measurements between two or more oscillators. Allan provided a method to convert between any M-sample variance to any N-sample variance via the common 2-sample variance, thus making all M-sample variances comparable. The conversion mechanism also proved that M-sample variance does not converge for large M, thus making them less useful. IEEE later identified the 2-sample variance as the preferred measure.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to common practise {{in many other}} physical sciences, the statistical analysis of PTTI data is often based directly on time domain techniques rather than on frequency domain (spectral analysis) techniques. The predominant analysis technique in the PTTI community, namely, the two-sample (or Allan) variance, {{is often used to}} indirectly infer frequency domain properties under the assumption of a power-law spectrum. Here we argue that direct use and estimation of the spectrum of PTTI data have a number of potential advantages. First, spectral estimators are typically scaled independent chi-square random variables with a known number of degrees of freedom. These properties allow easy computation of the variance of estimators of various quantities that are direct functions of the spectrum. Second, the effect of detrending data can be quantified more easily in the frequency domain than in the time domain. Third, the variance of estimators of the <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance</b> can be expressed in terms of readily estimated spectral density functions. This allows one to generate confidence intervals for the <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance</b> without explicitly assuming a statistical model. Fourth, there exist tractable statistical techniques for estimating the spectrum from data sampled on an unequally spaced grid or from data corrupted by a small proportion of additive outliers. The <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance</b> cannot be readily generalized to these situations. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{accepted}} {{definition of}} frequency {{stability in the}} time domain is the <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance</b> (or Allan variance). It {{is based on the}} measurement of average frequencies over adjacent time intervals, with no "dead time " between the intervals. The primary advantages of the Allan variance are that (1) it is convergent for many encountered noise models for which the conventional variance is divergent; (2) it can distinguish between many important and different spectral noise types; (3) the two-sample approach relates to many practical implementations; for example, the rms change of an oscillator's frequency from one period to the next; and (4) Allan variances can be easily estimated at integer multiples of the sample interval. In 1974 a table of bias functions which related variance estimates with various configurations of number of samples and dead time to the Allan variance was published [l]. The tables were based on noises with pure power-law spectral densities. Often situations occur that unavoidably have dead time between measurements, but still the conventional variances are not convergent. Some of these applications are outside of the time-and-frequency field. Also, the dead times are often distributed throughout a given average, and this distributed dead time is not treated in the 1974 tables. This paper reviews the bias functions B,(N,r,p), and BZ(r,p) and introduces a new bias function, B,(2,M,r,p), to handle the commonly occurring cases of the effect of distributed dead time on the computed variances. Some convenient and easy-to-interpret asymptotic limits are reported. A set of tables for the bias functions are included {{at the end of this}} paper.

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) Master Control Station (MCS) {{currently}} makes significant {{use of the}} Allan Variance. This <b>two-sample</b> <b>variance</b> equation {{has proven}} excellent as a handy, understandable tool, both for time domain analysis of GPS cesium frequency standards, and for fine tuning the MCS's state estimation of these atomic clocks. The Allan Variance does not explicitly converge for the nose types of alpha {{less than or equal}} to minus 3 and can be greatly affected by frequency drift. Because GPS rubidium frequency standards exhibit non-trivial aging and aging noise characteristics, the basic Allan Variance analysis must be augmented in order to (a) compensate for a dynamic frequency drift, and (b) characterize two additional noise types, specifically alpha = minus 3, and alpha = minus 4. As the GPS program progresses, we will utilize a larger percentage of rubidium frequency standards than ever before. Hence, GPS rubidium clock characterization will require more attention than ever before. The three sample variance, commonly referred to as a renormalized Hadamard Variance, is unaffected by linear frequency drift, converges for alpha is greater than minus 5, and thus has utility for modeling noise in GPS rubidium frequency standards. This paper demonstrates the potential of Hadamard Variance analysis in GPS operations, and presents an equation that relates the Hadamard Variance to the MCS's Kalman filter process noises...|$|E
40|$|A {{frequency}} counter measures the input frequency $\bar{\nu}$ averaged over a suitable time $\tau$, versus the reference clock. High resolution {{is achieved by}} interpolating the clock signal. Further increased resolution is obtained by averaging multiple frequency measurements highly overlapped. In the presence of additive white noise or white phase noise, the square uncertainty improves from $\smash{\sigma^ 2 _\nu\propto 1 /\tau^ 2 }$ to $\smash{\sigma^ 2 _\nu\propto 1 /\tau^ 3 }$.

Suppose estimating the model on each cluster yields q asymptotically unbiased, independent Gaussian estimators with potentially heterogeneous variances. Following Ibragimov and Müller (2010), one can then conduct asymptotically valid inference with a standard t-test based on the q cluster estimators, since at conventional signi…cance levels, the small sample t-test remains valid under variance heterogeneity. This note makes two contributions. First, we establish the new corresponding small sample result for the <b>two-sample</b> t-test under <b>variance</b> heterogeneity. One can therefore apply t-statistic based inference also for comparisons of parameters between two populations, such as treatment and control groups, or pre- and post-structural break data.

40|$|For short {{measurement}} times, the Allan (or <b>two-sample)</b> <b>variance</b> can {{be determined}} from the phase noise using the mathematical conversion between time and frequency domain. This provides us with a useful tool to obtain the very short-term frequency stability (τ＜ 0. 5 second) in the time domain, which is difficult for a time-interval counter to measure because of its resolution limitations. Before carrying out the conversion, bias from the measurement system and uncorrelated noises to the DUT (device under test), e. g. ac power noise and environmental perturbations are considered and corrected in the raw data. By doing this, the proper characteristic of the DUT seems to be revealed reasonably. If the above-mentioned bias and noises were not corrected, the generated variance would be apart from the corrected one irregularly, depending on the sampling time τ. In this paper, both the numerical integration and the power-law model are used to practice the conversion. The numerical integration is a straightforward way to use {{and we can get}} the integral approximation easily. In addition, a common model for the phase noise is linear combinations of power law processes, which are distinguished by the integer powers (α) in their functional dependence on Fourier frequency f with the appropriate coefficients hα. Fitting experimental data with standard regression techniques could have the values of these coefficients. Thereafter, we obtain the variance with Cutler’s equation using these values. The variances from these two ways are compared and inspected. Finally, because ac power noise is always inevitably getting into the measurement system and the DUT, we also make some discussions on the role it plays in the calculations of the Allan variance...|$|E

Materials and Methods The study {{was approved by the}} local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. SSP SWV (in meters per second) was prospectively assessed twice in 22 asymptomatic volunteers (mean age ± standard deviation, 53. 8 years ± 15. 3; 11 women and 11 men) by two independent examiners by using shear-wave elastography. Forty-four patients (mean age, 51. 9 years ± 15. 0; 22 women and 22 men) were prospectively included. SWV findings were compared with tendon integrity, tendon retraction (Patte classification), fatty muscle infiltration (Goutallier stages 0 -IV), and muscle volume atrophy (tangent sign) on magnetic resonance (MR) images. Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlation, analysis of <b>variance,</b> <b>two-sample</b> t test, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used. Results Test-retest reliability for mean total SWV (MTSWV) was good for examiner 1 (ICC = 0. 70; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 30, 0. 87; P =. 003) and excellent for examiner 2 (ICC = 0. 80; 95 % CI: 0. 53, 0. 92; P <. 001). Interexaminer reliability was excellent (ICC = 0. 89; 95 % CI: 0. 64, 0. 96; P <. 001). MTSWV in volunteers (3. 0 m/sec ± 0. 5) was significantly higher than that in patients (2. 5 m/sec ± 0. 5; P =. 001). For tendon integrity, no significant difference in MTSWV was found. For tendon retraction, MTSWV varies significantly between patients with different degrees of retraction (P =. 047). No significant differences were found for Goutallier subgroups. MTSWV was significantly lower with a positive tangent sign (P =. 015; n = 10). Conclusion Shear-wave elastography is reproducible for assessment of the SSP muscle. Mean normal SSP SWV is 3. 0 m/sec ± 0. 5. SWV decreases with increasing fat content (Goutallier stage 0 -III) and increases in the final stage of fatty infiltration (Goutallier stage IV).

The fact that people listen twice as much as they speak, four times as much as they read, and five times as much as they write and the regulation of some—or maybe many—high schools in Surabaya for English teachers to conduct their English classes using only English language make listening very important to be learnt. There are many techniques for teaching listening that can be applied in a classroom. But applying the most effective technique for teaching listening will help students to improve their listening achievement better. Therefore, the writer conducted a quantitative study to compare the effect of jigsaw listening and the effect of comprehension questions in teaching listening on the listening achievement of grade tenth students to find out whether jigsaw listening is effective in improving grade tenth students’ listening achievement which applies quasi-experimental pretest-posttest non-equivalent control group design. Three classes were chosen as the subjects of the study as they were proven to have not significantly different English ability after their mid-term test scores were counted using the computerized Anova: Single factor formula. Next, the writer randomly decided which of the three classes will be the pilot, the experimental group for jigsaw listening technique, and the control group for comprehension questions technique. After that, a series of experiment activities which was started by the tryout of the instrument in the pilot group was executed to answer the problem of the study which says, “Is there a significant difference between the listening achievement of students who are taught using comprehension questions technique and students who are taught using jigsaw listening?”.

Through Mind Mapping, students can develop their critical thinking by making map which is like brain branches that show the relationship of ideas that can be developed into complex writing. Therefore, in this study the writer wants to see the effect of mind mapping technique on the students’ narrative paragraph writing achievement in some writing criteria. In this study, the writer used a nonequivalent group pretest posttest design. The subject of this study was the ninth grade of SMPK Stella Maris Surabaya. The writer took two classes as the samples of this experiments, IXB and IXD. The experimental group was taught using Mind Mapping and the control group was taught using Semi-Controlled Writing. First of all, the writer gave pretest to both groups. The pretest was intended to measure the students’ narrative writing ability in some criteria. The treatments were given three times and 80 minutes for each. After that, the writer gave posttest to both groups to know the students’ response of the two techniques used. Then, the writer evaluated the pre and posttest of the two groups by using the analytic scoring technique, ESL Composition Profile. Their gain scores were analyzed using Ms. Excel t-Test: <b>Two-Sample</b> Assuming Unequal <b>Variances</b> to find out whether there was a significant effect of students’ narrative writing achievement in some criteria, such as content, vocabulary, organization, language use and as a whole narrative composition.
