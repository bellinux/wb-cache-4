5|$|In late 1172, Aswan was {{besieged by}} former Fatimid {{soldiers}} from Nubia {{and the governor}} of the city, Kanz al-Dawla—a former Fatimid loyalist—requested reinforcements from Saladin who complied. The reinforcements had come after the Nubians had already departed Aswan, but Ayyubid forces led by Turan-Shah advanced and conquered northern Nubia after capturing the town of Ibrim. Turan-Shah and his Kurdish soldiers temporarily lodged there. From Ibrim, they raided the surrounding region, halting their operations after being presented with an armistice proposal from the Dongola-based Nubian king. Although Turan-Shah's initial response was hawkish, he later sent an envoy to Dongola, who upon returning, described <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>of</b> the city and of Nubia in general to Turan-Shah. Consequently, the Ayyubids, like their Fatimid predecessors, were discouraged from further southward expansion into Nubia due to <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>of</b> the region, but required Nubia to guarantee the protection of Aswan and Upper Egypt. The Ayyubid garrison in Ibrim withdrew to Egypt in 1175.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Tønnies (1825–1903) {{remains to}} date {{one of the}} premier CDV photographers of Denmark. In June 1856 he began his {{photographic}} career as a partner under C. Fritsche in Aalborg and by December of the same year he bought his partner's share of the business and struck out with a studio under his own name. By 1861, Tönnies' business boomed requiring a larger studio and the hiring of assistants, and by 1870 he became a Danish citizen. Ultimately, his family business spanned three-generations and 75 years. The breadth of his photographic products included: Daguerreotypes, calotypes, pannotypes, photo-lithography, stereoscopy, ambrotypes, CDVs, and medallions. It is believed that he produced no less than 75,000 CDVs, many ordered in relation to a large wave of emigration from Nordjylland to North America. Owing to <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>of</b> Denmark's Vendsyssel region, local demands for inexpensive CDVs persisted in Aalborg right up until World War I, making Tönnies' studio one of the last to produce CDVs in Denmark.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 had {{resulted}} in a Russian withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of Corfu. The Treaty of Schönbrunn with the Austrian Empire in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the Illyrian Provinces on the Eastern shore. To protect these gains, the French and Italian governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in Venice and other Italian ports {{in an effort to}} rebuild their Mediterranean fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>of</b> the Italian government and the difficulty that the French Navy had in manning and equipping their ships. As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under this program was not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.|$|E
5|$|After Clouzot's ban was lifted, he {{reestablished}} {{his reputation}} and popularity in France {{during the late}} 1940s with films such as Quai des Orfèvres and Manon. For Quai des Orfèvres, Clouzot asked the author Stanislas-André Steeman {{for a copy of}} his novel, Légitime défense, to adapt into a film. Clouzot started writing the script before the novel arrived for him to read. Quai des Orfèvres was released in 1947 and was the fourth most popular film in France, drawing 5.5million spectators in that year. Clouzot directed and wrote two films that were released in 1949. For Manon, he wanted to cast unknown actors. He scoured schools to find an actress for the lead role, and chose 17-year-old Cécile Aubry after viewing over 700 girls. Manon was released in 1948 and was watched by 3.4million filmgoers in France as well as winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Clouzot directed and wrote the short film Le Retour de Jean, which was part of anthology film Return to Life. Le Retour de Jean was influenced by the short period when Clouzot lived in Germany in the early 1930s and stars Louis Jouvet as a survivor of a concentration camp who finds a wounded Nazi war criminal whom he interrogates and tortures. Clouzot's next film was the comedy Miquette et Sa Mère, which was a financial failure. During the film's production, Clouzot met Véra Gibson-Amado, whom he married on 15 January 1950. Clouzot and Véra took a film crew with them to Véra's homeland in Brazil for their honeymoon, where Clouzot made his first attempt at directing a documentary film. The Brazilian government took issue with Clouzot filming <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>of</b> people in the favelas rather than the more picturesque parts of Brazil. The film was never finished because the costs became too high. Clouzot became fascinated with the region and wrote a book, Le cheval des dieux, recounting his trip.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} “destitution” {{presents}} challenges to several preoccupations <b>of</b> contemporary <b>poverty</b> discourse: <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> (narrowly income-based versus broader multi-dimensional approaches); <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> (quantitative versus participatory methods); and the temporal dimension (chronic versus transitory <b>poverty).</b> Recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-dimensionality <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> {{has rarely been}} reflected in integrated analytical or policy frameworks. The Millennium Development Goals focus on simple quantitative targets, and fail to differentiate between degrees <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> By contrast, this paper argues that destitution is intrinsically a multi-dimensional concept, and it emphasises <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> – in contrast to “chronic poverty”, which emphasises <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> A definition <b>of</b> destitution is proposed with three components: inability to meet subsistence needs, assetlessness, and dependence on transfers.

40|$|The United States Bureau of the Census creates {{official}} poverty {{rates for}} most economically vulnerable populations, {{but not for}} working-age people with disabilities. We create a comparable poverty measure for working-age people {{with and without disabilities}} using March Current Population Surveys (1980 - 2005) and find that <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> rate <b>of</b> working-age people with disabilities relative to working-age people without disabilities has grown considerably. While <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> rate <b>of</b> working-age people without disabilities fell by over 20 percent over the period 1983 to 2004 (trough years of the 1980 s and 1990 s business cycles), <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> rate <b>of</b> those with disabilities remained about the same. Using shift-share analysis we show that the increase in <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> rate <b>of</b> working-age people with disabilities over the 1980 s business cycle was not greatly affected by compositional changes, but almost two-thirds of the decline in their <b>poverty</b> rate over <b>the</b> 1990 s business cycle was do to composition changes. When we control for compositional change, we find that <b>the</b> underlying <b>poverty</b> rate <b>of</b> working-age people with disabilities was greater in 2004 than in 1983. When we adjust for compositional changes in both groups, we find that the uncontrolled increase in <b>the</b> relative <b>poverty</b> risk <b>of</b> working-age people with disabilities is slightly reduced over the 1980 s, but rises even more over the 1990 s business cycle.
