5|$|This species' {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} shallow water is naturally susceptible to {{problems such as}} drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> of the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
