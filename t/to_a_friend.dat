5|$|Balzac {{borrowed}} {{money from his}} family and friends, and tried to build a printing business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that after his two preceding directorial ventures—Aladin and Home Delivery (2005)—performed poorly at the box office, Kahaani was his last chance to create a niche as a director. He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of the story <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E
5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> that he held a cocked pistol to his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E

5|$|When Haze turned 18, {{she tried}} {{stripping}} for a day, {{but did not}} enjoy being a house girl, giving lap dances to men she had to pretend to like for low wages. At age 19, while at her favorite nightclub in Anaheim, California, her boyfriend introduced her <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> who knew the adult actor Peter North and the actor/director Craven Moorehead.

5|$|As a {{relatively}} rural environment {{in an increasingly}} urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists was Richard Buxton {{who went on to}} write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These {{turned out to be a}} previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert to identify them. The moths were classified as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of her death, Garza was a second grade teacher; she taught indigent {{students}} at an elementary school {{on the south side of}} McAllen. In a letter that Garza wrote <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> shortly before her disappearance, Garza described herself as extremely shy, but she expressed fulfillment in her work. Noting that she had recently become secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she was beginning to feel more confident in herself. A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, she indicated that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E

5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{performances}} of his oratorio Gott und die Natur (God and Nature) (Berlin, 1811) and his early operas Jephtas Gelübde (Jephtha's Vow) (Munich, 1812) and Wirth und Gast (Landlord and Guest) (Stuttgart, 1813) in Germany, Meyerbeer had {{set his sights}} by 1814 on basing an operatic career in Paris. In the same year, his opera Die beiden Kalifen (The Two Caliphs), a version of Wirth und Gast, was a disastrous failure in Vienna. Realizing that {{a full understanding of}} Italian opera was essential for his musical development, he went to study in Italy, enabled by the financial support of his family. He arrived in Italy at the beginning of 1816, after visits to Paris and London, where he heard Cramer play. In Paris, he wrote <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> 'I go from museum to museum, library to library, theatre to theatre, with the restlessness of the Wandering Jew'.|$|E
5|$|Howard Peck, {{an animal}} trainer, brought the eight-month-old collie to Hollywood animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax {{in order to}} break the animal of {{uncontrolled}} barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E

5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend)</b> 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Smetana {{had written}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> the Czech poet Jan Neruda, {{revealing}} {{fears of the}} onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing a new symphonic suite, Prague Carnival, but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise. He started a new opera, Viola, based on the character in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but wrote only fragments as his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; {{by the middle of}} February 1884 he had ceased to be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12May 1884.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 1922, Cather wrote <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> Edwin H.

Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, no expense had been spared in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor {{on the basis of the}} work. She ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had not told the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone ought to know.|$|E
