This paper surveys the {{following}} problems concerning spectral properties of sign pattern matrices: sign patterns <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> all possible spectra (spectrally arbitrary sign patterns); sign patterns <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> all inertias (inertially arbitrary sign patterns); sign patterns <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> nilpotency (potentially nilpotent sign patterns); and sign patterns <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> stability (potentially stable sign patterns).

Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> them to breathe underwater, a shield <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E
