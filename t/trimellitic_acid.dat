The syntheses were performed as precipitation-polycondensations, and the polymers were obtained in particulate form. Besides globular particles of polymer, small quantities of elongated, needlelike particles were observed when the mole ratio TAAC/TC was less than 1. Use of X-ray microdiffraction with synchrotron radiation has revealed that the needlelike material consists of a cyclic compound containing 10 phenylene units, i. e., the crystals are of a [2 + 2] macrocyclic dimer. The polymers obtained are soluble in strong acids and in mixtures of methanesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid with chlorinated hydrocarbons. The molecular structures of the polymers were confirmed by H- 1 and C- 13 NMR spectroscopy. Reaction of TAAC with 4, 4 '-diphenoxybenzophenone produced mainly meta-orientation of the resulting ketone linkages. The size of the polymer particles, their molecular weights, and the melting behavior of the products obtained depend on the TAAC/TC ratio used. Ortho-keto acid residues, formed during reaction of anhydride groups of TAAC with 4, 4 '-diphenoxybenzophenone, exhibit ring-chain tautomerism. A carboxyl-containing aromatic polyketone derived from p-terphenyl, and thus having with no ether linkages in the main chain, was prepared by analogous chemistry, and functional derivatives of carboxy-substituted polyketones were also obtained and characterized...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to prepare and characterise zinc, copper and mixed zinc/copper trimellitates (1, 2, 4 -benzene tricarboxylates) and pyromellitates (1, 2, 4, 5 - benzene tetracarboxylates). The characterisation included a study of the thermal decomposition for selected salts. The literature is reviewed, discussing the synthesis, structural properties, and thermal decompostions of carboxylate salts. This review highlights the growing interest in benzene carboxylates, and a summary of the applications of such salts is given {{at the end of the}} review. The preparative route investigated in the work reported here involved reacting zinc/copper hydroxycarbonate, (Zn(_x) Cu(_ 1 -x)) (_n) (CO(_ 2)) (_p) (OH) q, with the carboxylic acid. This preparation was chosen in an attempt to overcome problems encountered during previous projects, which are discussed in the introduction. The preparation and characterisation of zinc/copper hydroxycarbonates were studied, concentrating on the preparation of single phase products. The hydroxycarbonate route was successful in producing single metal and mbced metal salts of <b>trimellitic</b> and pyromellitic <b>acid.</b> Limits of the solid solution series were deduced for the mixed metal carboxylates. Three trimelitate crystal structures, Zn(_ 2) OH(C(_ 6) H(_ 3) (COO) (_ 3)). 2 H(_ 2) O, ZnCuOH(C(_ 6) H(_ 3) (COO) (_ 3)). 2 H(_ 2) O, CuH(C(_ 6) H(_ 3) (COO) (_ 3)). 2. 5 H(_ 2) O, and one pyromellitate structure, ZnH(_ 2) (C(_ 6) H(_ 2) (COO) (_ 4)). 6 H(_ 2) O, were determined. The trimellitate structures were all polymeric layers, with the anion bridging between the metal sites. The pyromellitate had an ionic structure with [Zn(H(_ 2) O) (_ 6) ](^ 2 +) cations and [H(_ 2) (C(_ 6) H(_ 2) (COO) (_ 4)) ](^ 2) - anions. The dianion had very strong, intramolecular H-bonding. Using these and other crystal structures, it was possible to deduce a correlation between IR absorptions for carboxylate groups and the type of carboxylate coordination. The thermal decomposition of the metal salts was studied. An investigation was undertaken using DSC and temperature programmed decomposition to deduce the mechanism for the thermal decomposition of selected salts. The effect of the cation ratio (for the mixed metal salts) upon the decomposition was also studied.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{route to}} polyamide-imides is the condensation of an aromatic diamine, such as methylene dianiline (MDA) and <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> chloride (TMAC). Reaction of the anhydride with the diamine produces an intermediate amic acid. The acid chloride functionality reacts with the aromatic amine {{to give the}} amide bond and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as a by-product. In the commercial preparation of polyamideimides, the polymerization is carried out in a dipolar, aprotic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAC), dimethylformamide (DMF), or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at temperatures between 20-60 °C. The byproduct HCl must be neutralized in situ or removed by washing it from the precipitated polymer. Further thermal treatment of the polyamideimide polymer increases molecular weight and causes the amic acid groups to form imides with the evolution of water.|$|E
50|$|The polyamide-imides {{used for}} molded {{articles}} are {{also based on}} aromatic diamines and <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> chloride, but the diamines {{are different from those}} used in the products used for coatings and the polymer is more fully imidized prior to compounding and pellitizing. Resins for injection molding include unreinforced, glass-fiber reinforced, carbon fiber reinforced, and wear resistant grades. These resins are sold at a relatively low molecular weight so they can be melt processed by extrusion or injection-molding. The molded articles are then thermally treated for several days at temperatures up to 260 °C (500 °F). During this treatment, commonly referred to a postcure, the molecular weight increases through chain extension and the polymer gets much stronger and more chemically resistant. Prior to postcure, parts can be reground and reprocessed. After postcure, reprocessing is not practical.|$|E
40|$|The {{mesoscale}} induction of two-dimensional supramolecular chirality (formation of 20 organic domains with {{a single}} bandedness) was achieved by self-assembly of 1, 2, 4 -benzenetricarboxylic (<b>trimellitic)</b> <b>acid</b> on a Cu(100) surface at elevated temperatures. The combination of spectroscopic [X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) ], real-space-probe [scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) ], and computational [density functional theory (DFT) ] methods allows a comprehensive characterization of the obtained organic adlayers, where details of molecular adsorption geometry, intermolecular coupling, and surface chemical bonding are elucidated. The <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> species, comprising three functional carboxylic groups, form distinct stable mirror-symmetric hydrogen-bonded domains. The chiral ordering is associated with conformational restriction in the domains: molecules anchor to the substrate with an ortho carboxylate group, providing two para carboxylic acid moieties for collective lateral interweaving through H bonding, which induces a specific tilt of the molecular plane. The ease of molecular symmetry switching in domain formation makes homochiral-signature propagation solely limited by the terrace width. The molecular layer modifies the morphology of the underlying copper substrate and induces μm-sized strictly homochiral terraces. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA...|$|E

Pentaerythrite ester and <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> ester were used as lubricants. The lubricants differed in their molecular structure but showed only minor differences in their rheological and cohesive energetic properties. In order to investigate {{the effect of the}} lubricants on static and dynamic friction, macroscopic oscillatory tribometry experiments and gliding experiments were carried out. The surface and interfacial energies of PEEK, lubricant, and steel, which can be used to determine e. g. the spreading tendency of the lubricant, were employed to explain the tribological characteristics of the system. The gliding experiments exhibited a velocity dependence of the coefficient of friction which indicates a rate-and-state type of friction. <b>Trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> ester resulted in the lowest static and dynamic friction values due to its high tendency to spread. A different static friction behavior was found for pentaerythrite ester, which indicates a possible lubricant-induced mobilization of the polymer surface chains. This finding was supported by an increased interaction energy measured by contact angle measurements. The macroscopic oscillatory tribometry was shown to be a unique and precise method to investigate the transition from static to dynamic friction and to quantify macroscopic adhesive friction. Both types of experiments used a polished steel surface as a frictional partner, which favors the adhesive component of friction. However, the results for the lubricated contacts of polished steel surfaces in the boundary lubrication regime can give some insight into effects of the polymer transfer to rough steel surfaces in the mixed lubrication regime...|$|E

We therefore chemically characterized the adhesive interaction of 3 functional monomers with synthetic hydroxyapatite, using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We further characterized their interaction with dentin ultra-morphologically, using transmission electron microscopy. The monomer 10 -methacryloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP) readily adhered to hydroxyapatite. This bond appeared very stable, as confirmed by the low dissolution rate of its calcium salt in water.

40|$|Each dental {{adhesive}} {{contains a}} specific functional monomer that determines its actual adhesive performance to tooth tissue. 4 -methacryloxyethyl <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (4 -MET) is well-known {{as one of}} the functional monomers mostly available and consequently widely used in commercial adhesives. We therefore characterized the chemical - interaction of 4 -MET with hydroxy-apatite (HAp) using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). XPS revealed that the peak representing -COO- of 4 -MET shifted to a lower binding energy, when 4 -MET was adsorbed onto HAp. Deconvolution of this shifted peak disclosed two components with a peak representing unreacted carboxyl groups and ester groups, and a peak suggesting chemical bonding of other carboxyl groups to Ca of HAp. XPS spectra of HAp treated with 4 -MET also disclosed the surface to be enriched in calcium and decreased in phosphorus, indicating that phosphorus was extracted at a, relatively higher rate than calcium.

During bonding, functional monomers of self-etch adhesives chemically interact with hydroxyapatite (HAp). Here, we tested in how far the latter interaction of functional monomers with HAp counteracts the expected reduction in DC of camphorquinone/amine-based adhesives. DC of three experimental adhesive formulations, either containing {{one of the two}} functional monomers, namely 10 -MDP (10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate) and 4 -META (4 -methacryloxyethyl <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride), or a version without functional monomer (no-FM; control), was measured with and without HAp powder added to the adhesive formulations. Both the variables ‘functional monomer’ and ‘HAp’ were found to be significant, with the functional monomer reducing DC and HAp counteracting this effect. It is concluded that the functional monomers 10 -MDP and 4 -META interfere with the polymerization efficiency of adhesives. This interference is less prominent in the presence of HAp, which would clinically correspond to when these two functional monomers of the adhesive simultaneously interact with HAp in tooth tissue. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Benzene {{carboxylic}} acid (BCAs) are common and useful chemical blocks, {{which can be}} derived from the abundant low rank coals (LRCs) via oxidative degradation. In this work, we proposed a novel strategy to utilize BCAs as raw materials to prepare catalysts with transition metal zirconium, and the prepared catalysts were applied into the conversion of the renewable biomass resources. Typical model BCAs in the oxidative products of LRCs, including pyromellitic acid, trimesic acid (TMSA), <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid,</b> and benzoic acid, were used as the block to construct the Zr-BCAs catalysts. The chemoselective conversion of furfural into furfuryl alcohol (FAL), an important reaction in the biomass conversion chain, is chosen to evaluate the activity of the catalysts. The preparation conditions of the catalysts and experiment factors during the reaction were systematically investigated. The prepared catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and TG-DTG. The results showed that the prepared catalysts were efficient for the conversion of furfural into FAL, among which Zr-TMSA gave the highest activity. Zr-TMSA could be recycled for ten times without obvious deactivation, indicating an excellent stability. The strategy proposed in this work may be beneficial for the value-added utilization of both LRCs and biomass resources.|$|E

Structural characterisation allowed the influence of the linker geometry and the Bi 3 +:linker molar ratio in the starting solution on the crystal structure to be determined. The crystallisation of three selected compounds was investigated by in situ energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction. Three new crystalline intermediates were observed within minutes, and two of them could be isolated by quenching of the reaction mixture. Their crystal structures were determined from laboratory and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data and allowed a possible reaction pathway to be established. In depth characterisation of the luminescence properties of the three bismuth pyromellate compounds was carried out. Fluorescence and phosphorescence could be assigned to (mainly) ligand- and metal-based transitions.

Intramolecular coupling {{gives rise to}} heterocyclic ring systems (lactams, lactones, cyclopeptides, cyclic ethers, crown ethers) with ring sizes from 5 to 28 and a broad variety of functionalities. Intermolecular coupling gives Grignardtype adducts (but with different chemo- and regioselectivities as for carbanion reactions).

The electron-accepting chromophores which have been investigated are the imides of phthalic, maleic, quinolinic and <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid.</b> Selectivity can be further controlled by two simple tricks: - Only triplet excited acceptors are active in these electron-transfer reactions, thus sensitization excludes other (homolytic) pathways; - Donor groups (SR, NR₂, aryl, OR, C=C) other than the carboxylate can be activated by lowering the pH (and thus protonating the COO-donor).

Intramolecular PET reactions of quinolinic acid imides were studied with the potassium butyrate and hexanoate 1 a,b and a cysteine derivative 3. The photocyclizations products 2 a,b and 4 were formed with moderate regioselectivities (68 : 32, 57 : 43, and 81 : 19) showing preferential ortho cyclization. The intermolecular reaction of potassium propionate and potassium isobutyrate with N-methylquinolinic acid imide (5) yielded as addition products the dihydropyrrolo[3, 4 -b]pyridines 6 a,b with slight ortho regioselectivity (55 : 45). In contrast to these low regioselectivities, the PET reaction of potassium propionate with the methyl ester of N-methyltrimellitic acid imide (9) yielded solely the para addition product 10. Likewise, the intramolecular photoreaction of the cysteine derivative 7 gave a 75 : 25 (para/meta) mixture of regioisomeric cyclization products 8. The regioselectivity originates from donor-acceptor interactions prior to electron transfer and differences in spin densities in the corresponding imide radical anions. The results of DFT and ab initio calculations for the radical anions of the quinolinic acid imide (11 *-) and the methyl ester of <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> imide (12 *-) were in agreement with the latter assumption: spin densities in 11 *- were higher for the imido ortho carbon atoms (indicating preferential ortho coupling); for 12 *- the spin densities were higher for the imido para carbon atoms (indicating preferential para coupling). These correlations became more significant when the additional spin densities at the carbonyl oxygen and the adjacent carbon atoms were taken into account.

40|$|Objectives: Specific {{functional}} monomers as {{contained in}} self-etch adhesives {{have been documented}} to chemically bond to hydroxyapatite (HAp). In addition to this chemical bonding potential, also the etching (demineralization) potential of these acidic monomers is important for smear-layer dissolution and to provide surface micro-retention. The etching efficacy of functional monomers is commonly determined by measuring the pH. However, the pH of adhesive solutions cannot be accurately determined. Better is to measure the actual HAp-dissolving capacity, taking into account also the potential of functional monomers to deposit stable monomer-calcium salts. In this study, we investigated the etching efficacy of functional monomers by measuring the calcium concentration using ICP-AES {{and the amount of}} monomer-Ca salt formation using NMR. Methods: The functional monomers 2 -methacryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate (2 -MEP), 6 -methacryloyloxyhexyl dihydrogen phosphate (6 -MHP), 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP), 2 -methacryloxyethyl phenyl hydrogen phosphate (phenyl-P), 4 -methacryloxyethyl <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (4 -MET), glycerol phosphate dimethacrylate (GPDM), and 10 -methacryloyloxy tetraethyleneglycol dihydrogen phosphate (MTEGP) were investigated. 1. 0 g functional monomer was used to prepare a 15 wt% monomer/ 45 wt% ethanol/ 40 wt% water solution that was subsequently mixed with 0. 2 g of HAp for 1 hr. [Ca] and [P] of the initial and supernatant liquid were measured using ICP-AES. The precipitation of monomer-Ca salts was confirmed with XRD and analyzed using 31 P MAS NMR. Results: ICP-AES revealed the highest [Ca] produced by phenyl-P, followed in order by 2 MEP = MTEG-P > GPDM > 6 -MHP > 10 -MDP > 4 -MET. Only 10 -MDP formed 10 -MDP_Ca salt, indicating that 10 -MDP released more Ca from HAp than was measured by ICP-AES. Although 10 -MDP seemed to have etched HAp less as appeared from the lower [Ca] measured, part of the released Ca was consumed to form 10 -MDP_Ca salts. Conclusions: The high bonding potential of 10 -MDP-based adhesives is suggested to result from a combined etching and chemical bonding potential. status: submitte...|$|E
40|$|The Rhodium catalyzed maleinisation of {{monounsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} leads to cyclic 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid derivatives and acyclic maleinated byproducts, which {{are similar to}} the products formed by Ene-reaction. Two different catalysts, RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 and Rh(OAc) 2, were investigated. It was found that Rh(OAc) 2 shows a higher selectivity toward the cyclic products as well as higher conversions compared to RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3. Furthermore it was observed that the double bond configuration of the fatty acid influences the yields and the product composition of the maleinated products. The Rh(OAc) 2 -catalysis leads mainly to the cyclic THPAs. If the cis-configurated oleic acid is used, one cyclic main product is formed, whereas the trans-configurated elaidic acid leads to three different isomers. Furthermore a decrease of the overall yield of the maleinated products was observed for elaidic acid, compared to oleic acid. In contrast to that, the RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 -catalyst tends to result favorably {{in the formation of the}} acyclic products. If oleic acid is used, the formation of two different constitutional syn-isomers was observed. In addition to that the maleinisation of elaidic acid gives also the anti-form, so that four different products could be detected by NMR-experiments. Practical applications: Fatty acid based 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid (THPA) derivatives are promising monomers for polycondensation processes. The substructure of the six-membered carbon ring is of great interest for the hardness of the resulting polyesters. The mentioned THPA derivatives are commonly synthesized via Diels-Alder reaction of conjugated fatty acids and maleic anhydride. The main disadvantage of this synthesis route is caused by monounsaturation of many natural fatty acids, e. g., oleic acid, or by the non-conjugation of the most natural fatty acids, e. g., linoleic acid which requires a further step for conjugation. The Rh-catalyzed maleinisation enables the synthesis of such cyclic structures using monounsaturated fatty acids, e. g., oleic acid. The resulting THPAs are considered to be biobased substitutes with good prospects, e. g., for phthalic acid anhydride, <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> and their di-, tetra-, or hexahydro-derivatives, which are commonly used in polycondensation processes.

40|$|Methylene diphenylene {{diisocyanate}} (4, 4 '-MDI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important raw materials for making polyurethane (PU) polymers. MDI being a crystalline solid with melting point of 38 ~ 40 oC is generally refrigerated under - 10 C to prevent it from undergoing dimerization. In the plant scale production, the work involved heating up and thawing of the MDI solid before its utilization has been a cumbersome process. The technology to liquefy 4, 4 '-MDI has been sought for decades, and has been the target of my research. Our research group at NCHU has been worked in the chemistry of isocyanate for the last five years, and particularly on the conversion of isocyanate into carbodiimide (CDI) derivatives. My research has attempted to liquefy 4, 4 '-MDI by converting small portion of isocyanate groups of MDI into branched or unsymmetrical structures consisting of either acylurea, amide or urea derivatives so that they could depress the melting point of pure MDI. The formation of acylurea and amide derivatives could be easily accomplished by the partial introduction of carbodiimide groups into MDI followed by the addition of di-carboxylic acids at various temperatures. When no heat was applied to the CDI-Diacid reaction, the product was essentially acylurea whereas amide derivative became the product if heated to 120 and above. Special ether-imide diacid (EI Diacid) have been prepared for this research from <b>trimellitic</b> <b>acid</b> (TMA) and Jeffamines of different chain lengths and ethoxylated/propoxylated ratios in the ether chains. In yet another approach, MDI with partial functionalized biuret groups has also been prepared for screening. Among the three approaches attempted, it was found that the partial amide fuctionalizations of MDI with EI Diacids prepared from Jeffamine ED series have been the most successful. The best liquefied MDI product has the initial viscosity of 45. 6 cps at NCO% of 29. 56 % and the viscosity of 56. 7 cps at NCO% of 28. 61 after 2 months. 二苯基甲烷二異氫酸鹽（ 4, 4 ’-MDI）是最重要的聚胺酯原料之一，其熔點約 38 ~ 40 ℃，在室溫下儲存為固體結晶。此外 4, 4 ’-MDI還有自身二量化之特性易形成二量體，對於產品會有不良影響，因此須冷凍儲存以減少二量體的產生。工業製程中在使用前就必須先將它加熱融化後才能夠使用。鑒於工業製程上處理不易的缺點，本研究以嘗試製備液態 4, 4 ’-MDI為主要目標。 以我們實驗室對於異氰酸鹽近五年來的化學研究為基礎，特別是對異氰酸鹽轉化成碳二醯胺的化學。本研究嘗試將部分MDI轉化成部分的醯脲(Acylurea) 、醯胺(Amide) 或是縮二脲(Biuret) 衍生物，利用這些不對稱、含支鏈結構的分子降低MDI的熔點來製備液態MDI。Acylurea衍生物及Amide衍生物可由二苯基甲烷二異氫酸鹽(4, 4 ’-MDI) 轉化部分少量的碳二醯胺(CDI) 後，再與有機二元酸在不同溫度下反應部份生成得到，前者不須加熱可得到，後者經加熱 120 ℃裂解後可得到。特殊的醚基-醯亞胺二元酸(EI-Diacid) 是由不同鏈長及乙烷氧基/丙烷氧基比例的Jeffamine與偏苯三甲酸酐(TMA) 合成得。另一種方法則是製備含縮二胺液態MDI。 在本研究主要嘗試三種的方式中，以使用Jeffamine ED series的IE-Diacid所製備出來含部份Amide的液態MDI表現較為佳。表現最好的液態MDI最初黏度為 45. 6 cps，NCO%為 29. 1 %，且在存放兩個月之後的黏度變化為 56. 7 cps，NCO%為 28. 61 %。摘要 [...] …… [...] I Abstract…… [...] II 目錄 [...] …….
