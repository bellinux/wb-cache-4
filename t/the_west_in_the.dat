5|$|Chromium {{minerals}} as pigments came to {{the attention}} of <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. On 26 July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the mineral was in fact crocoite (lead chromate) with a formula of PbCrO4.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea from a broad area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next day. Prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system was analyzed to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm began to move more towards <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E

That season, Roy won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in a near-unanimous vote. He was selected as a reserve to the 2008, 2009, and 2010 All-Star games. Roy played the most minutes of any Western Conference player, and tied for the most points in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2008 season, and he played the most minutes of any player during the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|From 1877 to 1882, Jovanović honed {{his artistic}} skills at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, {{studying}} under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In {{the early part}} of his career, he painted mostly Orientalist works, which were in high demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1880s, Jovanović turned to history painting, depicting scenes from the history of the Serb people, as seen in The Takovo Uprising (1888). Nevertheless, his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist.|$|E

5|$|In 1285, {{increasing}} Tatar {{pressure from}} the northeast had forced the Second Bulgarian Empire to come under the political dependence of Nogai Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde. At the time Shishman's realm centred at Vidin was largely independent from the Bulgarian tsars in Tarnovo, though he retained a degree of loyalty to Bulgaria and maintained friendly relations with Serbia. However, in 1291 Shishman too was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Nogai in order to counter the increasing Serbian pressure from <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year, the joint forces of Hungarian vassal Stephen Dragutin and Serbian king Stephen Milutin (r. 1280–1321) had managed to oust two Cuman–Bulgarian nobles and allies of Shishman, Darman and Kudelin, who were {{in control of the}} Braničevo region.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day of Dodge's victory, another {{skirmish}} took place at Kellogg's Grove in present-day Stephenson County, Illinois. American forces had occupied Kellogg's Grove {{in an effort to}} intercept war parties raiding to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> First Battle of Kellogg's Grove, militia commanded by Adam W. Snyder pursued a British Band raiding party of about thirty warriors. Three Illinois militiamen and six Native warriors died in the fighting. Two days later, on June 18, militia under James W. Stephenson encountered what was probably the same war party near Yellow Creek. The Battle of Waddams Grove became a hard fought, hand-to-hand melee. Three militiamen and five or six Indians were killed in the action.|$|E
5|$|Settlements {{along the}} eastern shore of Lake Washington were {{established}} in the late 19th century by homesteaders, real estate developers, and industrialists. A ferry system was set up between towns on the lake and Seattle to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s. By 1913, the steam ferry Leschi was transporting automobiles, in addition to pedestrian traffic, between Seattle and docks in Bellevue, Kirkland, and Medina. In 1940, the Lake Washington Floating Bridge was opened between Seattle and Mercer Island, carrying the Sunset Highway (later I-90) from Seattle towards Bellevue and the Eastside. The new bridge allowed for the Eastside to rapidly develop into bedroom communities in the 1940s and 1950s; the bridge also replaced the ferry system, which ceased operation in 1950, shortly after the removal of tolls on the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Peter was {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid 13th century and had a three-stage tower added in the 15th, however it was extensively restored when the main house {{was built in the}} late 17th century.

5|$|The {{origins of}} yoga have been speculated to {{date back to}} pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is {{mentioned}} in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements.

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from {{the first half of}} the 1st millennium CE, but only gained prominence in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.

5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E
5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up.|$|E
5|$|Type-0 {{has never}} {{received}} an official localization {{in its original}} form.

Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.|$|E
