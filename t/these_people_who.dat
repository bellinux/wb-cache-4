25|$|Besides prehistoric rock-carvings to {{be found}} {{especially}} along the Yenisei banks, the first internationally important archaeological findings have been near Arzhan, in the north central Tuva. Here, Scythian kurgan burials are being researched, revealing the earliest (7th, 6th century BC) and easternmost remains of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> spread {{all the way to}} Europe. Their story and fantastic gold treasures can be appreciated in the National Museum in Kyzyl.|$|E
25|$|As both Korea and Taiwan {{had been}} under the {{domination}} of Japan for an indefinite amount of time, many citizens of both territories were forced to work under the Japanese military and experienced violence for a long time. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are used {{to be familiar with}} the harsh kind of treatment in their life combined with their anger towards the Japanese are then sent to Borneo to work as prison guards to replace the existing Japanese guards. In addition to their lack of knowledge and training for the treatment of POWs, many of them are involved in brutalising the POWs where the treatment of POWs are much worsened after the replacement of Japanese guards in Elopura by the Taiwanese in April 1943.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the site}} of Mission San Jose {{commenced}} in May 1797 by Native American people from Mission Santa Clara, 13 miles to the south, under direction of Franciscan missionaries and secular Hispanic overseers. The location, on slopes overlooking the Fremont plain {{on the east side of}} San Francisco Bay, had been inhabited for countless generations by Indians who spoke the San Francisco Bay Ohlone language. The Ohlone lived a hunting and wild-plant harvesting lifestyle. Their food included seeds, roots, berries, the flour from acorns, small game, deer, fish, and shellfish. In 1797 most of the Indians, from the immediate vicinity of the mission site had actually already been baptized at Mission Santa Clara, 13 miles to the south, during the 1780s and early 1790s. It was <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> returned home to form the founding population of the new community. (Milliken 2008) Mission San José's walls were 5 ft thick.|$|E

25|$|The Mayos are {{the most}} {{numerous}} indigenous ethnic group in the state with more than 75,000 who have maintained their language and traditions. <b>These</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> call themselves Yoreme, are descended from ancient Huatabampo culture. They are concentrated along the Mayo River. Most {{are found in the}} municipalities of Álamos, Quiriego and others in the south of the state, as well as {{in some parts of the}} coast near the Isla Tiburón. There is also a notable community in the northwest of Sonora. Their religion is a mix of Catholicism and traditional beliefs, which they assimilated along with European farming and livestock knowledge. Mayo houses often have a cross made of ironwood to protect against evil. Ethnically pure Mayos tend to segregate themselves from mestizos and other ethnicities. The Mayos make their living from subsistence farming, working on larger farms and combing wild area for herbs, fruits and other resources. They also work making crafts in wood making utensils and decorative items.|$|E
25|$|The Early Woodland Period {{began in}} 1000 BC as plants became an {{increasingly}} {{important part of the}} people's diet. Small scale agriculture and pottery arrived in southern Wisconsin at this time. The primary crops were maize, beans and squash. Agriculture, however, could not sufficiently support <b>these</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> also had to hunt and gather. Agriculture at this time was more akin to gardening than to farming. Villages emerged along rivers, streams and lakes, and the earliest earthen burial mounds were constructed. The Havana Hopewell Culture arrived in Wisconsin in the Middle Woodland Period, settling along the Mississippi River. The Hopewell people connected Wisconsin to their trade practices, which stretched from Ohio to Yellowstone and from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico. They constructed elaborate mounds, made elaborately decorated pottery and brought a wide range of traded minerals to the area. The Hopewell people may have influenced the other inhabitants of Wisconsin, rather than displacing them. The Late Woodland Period began in about 400 AD, following the disappearance of the Hopewell Culture from the area. The people of Wisconsin first used the bow and arrow in the final centuries of the Woodland Period, and agriculture continued to be practiced {{in the southern part of}} the state. The effigy mound culture dominated Southern Wisconsin during this time, building earthen mounds in the shapes of animals. Unlike earlier mounds, many of these were not used for burials. Examples of effigy mounds still exist at High Cliff State Park and at Lizard Mound County Park. In northern Wisconsin people continued to survive on hunting and gathering, and constructed conical mounds.|$|E

After filming of the scene was completed, the footage was sent to be developed for the post-production process at a processing plant in Germany. The wrong chemical was accidentally used in development, damaging the film and requiring the crew to seek permission from the government to re-shoot the scenes. Permission was granted and a spokesman for the film indicated the schedule and budget had not been affected.|$|E

500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation.

He said that the Borg was a [...] "incredibly interwoven, complex community" [...] and [...] "once you knocked it all down you would have all <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. It {{occurred to me that}} a group of ex-Borg would be a very interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{started on}} the project in May. One lane of traffic in each {{direction}} was maintained for US41/M-28. Motorist seeking access to downtown were detoured via Grove Street or Lakeshore Boulevard. The Downtown Development Authority had plans to purchase billboards helping to direct customers to the downtown shopping district. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened {{in the beginning of}} August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day. To address residents' concerns about truck traffic through the intersection, the mayor note that truck used the roundabout after the ribbon was cut. [...] "It just cruised right around and through. All of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are wondering is it big enough, can you get a firetruck on it? Yes, you can," [...] stated Mayor John Kivela.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, {{two years}} after his wife Margaret's death from cancer, Davies married Sephora Davies, a schoolteacher from Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen in Carmarthenshire who shared Davies's {{political}} outlook. The couple lived at Gwynfryn Park Terrace in Merthyr Tydfil, and had two sons. In November 1936, having been returned in the 1935 general election with an increased majority, Davies ridiculed the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, for his refusal to meet a delegation from the National Unemployed Workers' Movement's 1936 Hunger March, which included a large contingent from South Wales: [...] "A bigger man would meet <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have tramped the roads {{of this country and}} would show that he had sympathy with them". In 1938, having modified his earlier position, Davies supported a bill introduced by the Labour opposition for the nationalisation of the coal industry. Miners worked, he said, in intolerable conditions to ensure that cheap raw material was available to industry. Reasonable wages and working conditions would never be granted by private coal-owners. The bill was defeated.|$|E

500|$|Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, {{where they}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally {{concerned that they}} had taken [...] "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" [...] {{because it was the}} only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: [...] "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." [...] New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of only $17,000. With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, [...] "we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> conceptualize things.

500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
500|$|As {{she struggles}} with her condition, doctors suggest to Karl that {{going back to}} {{familiar}} surroundings may trigger the return of her memories. Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but nothing happens. Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were.
