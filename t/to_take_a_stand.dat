5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

50|$|Taylor was a {{supporter}} of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, one of whose arguments was that an unintended war brought about by accident could cause a nuclear war and the end of human civilisation. In Taylor's view if the Second World War could start by accident, so could a Third. He also was opposed to the idea that it was necessary for the Western powers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> tough <b>stand</b> against the Soviet Union as failure <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> similar <b>stand</b> against Nazi Germany had led to war.|$|R
25|$|During the {{farewell}} season, {{two hundred}} {{men who were}} molested came forward {{as part of a}} two-day event in 2010 <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against sexual abuse. The men were joined by director and producer Tyler Perry, who had also experienced sexual abuse. Winfrey hoped that the episode would help survivors suffering in silence release the shame.|$|E

Athlete Ally also provides public awareness campaigns, educational programming, and tools and resources to foster inclusive sports communities around the country.|$|E
25|$|After {{meeting with}} local Lions Club members, he {{borrowed}} $3,600 {{to take over}} the defunct Troy Call newspaper in 1948, becoming the nation's youngest editor-publisher, of the renamed Troy Tribune in Troy, Illinois, eventually building a chain of 14 weekly newspapers. His activism against gambling, prostitution, and government corruption while at the Troy Tribune influenced the newly elected Governor, Adlai Stevenson, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> on these issues, creating national exposure for Simon that later resulted in his testifying before the Kefauver Commission.|$|E

25|$|Bhutto feared civil war, {{and sent}} a secret message to Mujib and his inner circle to arrange a meeting with them. Hassan met with Mujib and persuaded him to form a {{coalition}} government with Bhutto. They decided that Bhutto would serve as President, with Mujib as Prime minister. These developments took place secretly {{and none of the}} Pakistan Armed Forces personnel were kept informed. Meanwhile, Bhutto increased the pressure on Yahya Khan <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> on dissolving the government.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s {{former leader}} {{stated that the}} Congress Party governments have been {{involved}} in creating terrorism in the Punjab. Recently, BJP national president Lal Krishna Advani, stated that it was his party which pressured Sikh Extremists <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against the government. The policy to help the Congress Party by creating militants and moderates backfired resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocent people. Two notable attacks in Punjab were in 1991 and 1987, both attacks involving militants.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} morning, heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out in}} Khanasor. Both sides later accused each other of having initiated the battle: Whereas the YBŞ {{said that they had}} peacefully asked the KNC fighters to leave the town, whereupon the latter attacked them with heavy weapons, the Rojava Peshmerga stated that they were first shot at and decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> rather than simply retreat. In any case, heavy clashes broke out, during which several fighters were killed or wounded, and several civilians also became casualties.|$|E

25|$|Bartel has {{publicly}} discussed {{the domestic violence}} perpetrated by his father during his early life. Bartel's father kept intermittent contact with Jimmy and his sisters throughout their childhood, but Jimmy severed ties with him after his 21st birthday following a violent incident involving his father, sister, and newborn nephew. Bartel accused his father of being an aggressive and heavy drinker, and was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand,</b> severing all contact with his father {{until his death in}} 2010. In the aftermath of Bartel's victory in the 2007 Brownlow Medal count, the family's issues were spotlighted throughout the media, after an interview with Terry Bartel by the Herald Sun revealed his plea for reconciliation with his children.|$|E
25|$|William Seward {{contemplated}} {{this potential}} in the 1840s, when the Democrats were the nation's majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country's institutional structure and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation's territories and to garner {{a great deal of}} influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals of American democracy.|$|E
25|$|Disputes over slavery {{placed the}} church in {{difficulty}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, with the northern church leaders fearful of a split with the South, and reluctant <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand.</b> The Wesleyan Methodist Connexion (later became The Wesleyan Church) and the Free Methodist Churches were formed by staunch abolitionists, and the Free Methodists were especially active in the Underground Railroad, which helped to free the slaves. Finally, in a much larger split, in 1845 at Louisville, the churches of the slaveholding states left the Methodist Episcopal Church and formed The Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The northern and southern branches were reunited in 1939, when slavery was no longer an issue. In this merger also joined the Methodist Protestant Church. Some southerners, conservative in theology, and strongly segregationist, opposed the merger, and formed the Southern Methodist Church in 1940.|$|E

50|$|Tom Lantos assigns {{the blame}} for the {{withdrawal}} of the U.S. in part to the radicalism of many of the NGOs at the NGO Forum, to an inadequate response thereto by U.S.-based NGOs, and to the reluctance of the U.S.'s European allies <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>stand.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even fifty-five {{years later}} the case of Mašíns is able to deeply divide the Czech public into two groups: one seeing them as heroes, the other abhorring their {{sometimes}} brutal killings. Politicians in the Czech Republic face uneasy difficulty when trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>stand</b> on the Mašíns.|$|R
25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (<b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a fait accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|Affiliates {{discussed}} {{the issues in}} Internet forums and began to organize their efforts. They believed {{that the best way}} to address the problem was to discourage merchants from advertising via adware. Merchants that were either indifferent to or supportive of adware were exposed by affiliates, thus damaging those merchants' reputations and tarnishing their affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates either terminated the use of such merchants or switched to a competitor's affiliate program. Eventually, affiliate networks were also forced by merchants and affiliates <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> and ban certain adware publishers from their network. The result was Code of Conduct by Commission Junction/beFree and Performics, LinkShare's Anti-Predatory Advertising Addendum, and ShareASale's complete ban of software applications as a medium for affiliates to promote advertiser offers. Regardless of the progress made, adware continues to be an issue, as demonstrated by the class action lawsuit against ValueClick and its daughter company Commission Junction filed on April 20, 2007.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of Meiji Japan considered Queen Min {{an obstacle to}} its overseas expansion. Efforts to remove her from the political arena, orchestrated through failed rebellions prompted by the father of King Gojong, the Heungseon Daewongun (an influential regent working with the Japanese), compelled her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> harsher <b>stand</b> against Japanese influence.|$|R

Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk praised the album in an eight-out-of-ten review: [...] "The quartet has a much bigger goal than just getting kids to dance to their breakdowns, rather they focus on {{putting a lot of}} substance into each track, hoping to inspire this generation <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> and make change amongst the broken systems throughout the world".|$|E
500|$|Britain vigorously rallied other NATO {{countries}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>stand</b> against Portugal over Reedman. France {{warned that}} NATO pressure {{was unlikely to}} yield results in his matter, but Belgium's NATO representative, André de Staercke, agreed to challenge Salazar on 11 September. At his meeting with de Staercke, Salazar denied that Portugal was giving Rhodesia its own diplomatic representation, and {{said there had been}} some misunderstanding. Portugal would not obstruct Reedman's entry should he arrive, Salazar said, as he was travelling on a (Rhodesian-issued) British passport. On 14 September, Nogueira's ministry released a statement saying that if Britain challenged Portugal over Rhodesia at NATO, Lisbon would [...] "use the greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of Portugal's position".|$|E
