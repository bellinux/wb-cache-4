5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, be frank about <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> them unhappy, and refer to anything {{they do not want to}} do but must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E

25|$|In March 2006, {{the album}} Life on the Murder Scene was released, {{incorporating}} a CD and two DVDs. It included one documentary DVD chronicling the band's history, {{and a second}} DVD with music videos, the making of their videos and live performances. An unauthorized biography DVD <b>Things</b> <b>That</b> <b>Make</b> You Go MMM! was also released in June 2006. The DVD does not actually feature any My Chemical Romance music clips or performances but contains interviews with those who knew the band before much of their fame. A biography titled Something Incredible This Way Comes was also released, written by Paul Stenning and published in 2006. It features information on their beginnings right through to their third album, The Black Parade.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} P. R. Brown, and released on November 7, 2016. The video reflects the song's central theme of being in unsettled situations and getting through them. In {{the beginning of the}} video, Armstrong is shown as a solitary figure; his bandmates Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are sitting lethargically in a different location. The video explores situations of various other characters as well, all starting out in a dejected state. The shots of Armstrong, Dirnt, and Cool are repeatedly seen interspersed with developments {{in the lives of the}} other characters. Eventually, all of them manage to find <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> them happy. As the video reaches its end, Armstrong is seen entering a warehouse and being happily reunited with his bandmates, who had begun to play their instruments.|$|E

500|$|In summary, Whitehead {{rejects the}} idea of {{separate}} and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favor of {{the idea of}} reality as interrelated events in process. [...] He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic [...] "becoming" [...] rather than static [...] "being", emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve, and that changeless [...] "essences" [...] such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> up the world.|$|E
500|$|Lady Bracknell's line, [...] "A handbag?", {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most {{malleable}} in English drama, lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled. Edith Evans, both on stage and in the 1952 film, delivered the line loudly in a mixture of horror, incredulity and condescension. Stockard Channing, in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in 2010, hushed the line, in a critic's words, [...] "with a barely audible 'A handbag?', rapidly swallowed up with a sharp intake of breath. An understated take, to be sure, but with such a well-known play, packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with a life of their own, it's the little <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> a difference." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–", {{arguing that it}} was an example of the series' {{continued}} growth: he wrote, [...] "as Finn grows, so does this series". Sava opined that, [...] "the final minute of “Billy’s Bucket List” drops a major plot-bomb that gives the series an exciting direction for next season, and while the events leading up to the cliffhanger aren't quite as provocative or substantial as the last few episodes, they represent all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> this show such a great 10-minute oasis {{at the beginning of the}} week." [...] Sava also noted that, [...] "Trippy psychedelia is another major ingredient of this series, and 'Billy’s Bucket List' delivers a heavy serving when Finn finds himself underwater." ...|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{praised the}} episode {{compared}} to the first few episodes of the season, writing it balanced Veronica's character traits well, including her jealousy and generosity. He also wrote that it showed her as a character with some [...] "baser instincts", giving the scene with Jeff as an example. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. The reviewer was very critical {{of what he called}} the [...] "'radical feminist fakes her own rape'" [...] storyline, but he praised the episode as the first one of the third season to make the college setting feel natural. Although he thought that the case-of-the-week contributed to his overall positive view of the episode, he thought that [...] "it's mostly the little <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> it work", pointing out Piz's increased role as an example.|$|E
500|$|Wenger managed Nagoya for {{the final}} time on 28 August 1996 and {{delivered}} a farewell speech, thanking the fans in Japanese. Assessing his time in Japan, biographer Jasper Rees felt Wenger had left a mixed legacy at the club, as the immediate success was followed by fluctuating league finishes; {{it was not until}} 2010 that Nagoya (under Stojković) won their first title. Wenger continues to speak fondly of his career in Japan and once likened the country to his ancestral home: [...] "It has beautiful things that we have lost in Europe, beautiful <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> life good." [...] He also credited the culture for improving his temperament and rediscovering his passion for the game. Wenger returned to Japan as a television pundit for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and a decade later, took Arsenal to face Nagoya in a pre-season friendly.|$|E
500|$|Press in Europe {{ranged from}} mixed to negative. The press in Germany {{did not like}} the film. At the Berlin premiere, a writer for The New York Times wrote [...] "Whatever you think of the {{director}} Charles [...] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is 'different.' He does <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> people talk about him. You may find his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{is invited}} to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and {{commentator}} Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television [...] such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, he pours [...] "gravy of freedom" [...] over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy {{as a metaphor for}} the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> the country great. He then encourages his viewers to [...] "get on the boat" [...] to protest about the bad things in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head. This wins Homer a huge base of support among average Americans, and soon the [...] "gravy boat movement" [...] becomes popular throughout the country.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, Autumn {{released}} the acronym of her upcoming album, F.L.A.G., on her Twitter account, before revealing the full title as Fight Like a Girl. In her words, the meaning behind {{the title is}} [...] "about taking all these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> women the underdogs and using them to your advantage". Based on her fictional novel, The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, the album {{has been described as}} [...] "an operatic feminist treatise set inside an insane asylum, wherein the female inmates gradually realize their own strength in numbers". On August 30, 2010, she announced that she would be undergoing jaw surgery, and recovered from it. In September 2011, she posted the full lyrics to the album's title track, [...] "Fight Like a Girl", on her Twitter account. Autumn appeared at the 2011 Harvest Festival in Australia, and had planned to debut two songs from Fight Like a Girl during those performances. On April 11, 2012, Autumn {{released the}} single [...] "Fight Like a Girl", with the song [...] "Time for Tea" [...] appearing as a B-side.|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for anime and manga have {{commented on}} the use of jutsu in the series. IGN called jutsu [...] "one of the most entertaining parts of the Naruto franchise", and noted that [...] "the complicated but impressive-looking hand gestures, the unique physical attributes, and the pure unadulterated destructive power of the ninjutsu are some of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> the series wildly popular". T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews claimed that it was in [...] "fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades", and praised the [...] "invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques [...] manage to continuously infuse action sets with life". However, it criticized the [...] "overemployment of certain special techniques" [...] such as Naruto Uzumaki's Shadow Clone Technique, noting that the fights became [...] "bland and repetitive" [...] over time. Anime News Network (ANN) considered the structure of battles [...] "repetitive to a fault – a series of competing power-ups followed by an elegiac coda", but mollified by the series' [...] "winning formula: the villains are vile, the heroes sympathetic, and the stakes high".|$|E

500|$|Danny Hale at Flickering Myth said [...] "Lockup" [...] is [...] "a really, {{really fun}} episode", and was thankful that Johnson rejoining S.H.I.E.L.D. was not [...] "resolved without the {{appropriate}} time for the audience to feel her absence". Hale also noted {{the introduction of the}} Darkhold, Coulson and May's interactions, and the added mystery to Mace's character as all <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> [...] "for good viewing and has me hooked for next week." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow scored the episode three stars out of 5, feeling the season was lacking a [...] "truly compelling villain" [...] and saying the ghost effects look [...] "absolutely terrible". Meslow said the prison scenes had [...] "quippy dialogue" [...] and [...] "solid action scenes", but was more interested in the Mace/Simmons storyline. For Nerdist, Joseph McCabe said, [...] "When S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it doesn’t offer viewers much to dissect. Because it’s all about its momentum, [...] is a textbook example: forty-two minutes of adrenaline without a single wasted moment." [...] He felt the episode had several satisfying character-based moments, especially the scenes between Coulson and May, and though McCabe felt Woods was not the most [...] "adept at staging fight sequences", he still praised the choreography of Johnson's action scenes.|$|E
500|$|Eva Bella and Spencer Lacey Ganus {{were cast}} to portray Elsa {{as a young}} child and as a teenager, respectively. Actress and singer Megan Mullally was {{originally}} cast to voice an adult Elsa. but was replaced by Idina Menzel, a Broadway actress and singer best known for performing as Elphaba in Wicked. Menzel already knew Kristen Bell, who voiced Anna, and had previously auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney film Tangled. She was not cast for the part, but the casting director recorded her singing and later showed the recording to Frozens film executives. Menzel was surprised when she was subsequently asked to audition, and she received the role after reading the script out loud. In interviews, she acknowledged similarities between Elsa, her then-current role, and Elphaba, her previous role. Namely, she said, they were both very powerful and very misunderstood individuals. She further said that she related to the characters, having hidden her singing talent from her peers at school. [...] "I didn't want to alienate anyone," [...] she explained. [...] "If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off, when in fact we should own those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> us really unique." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Doctor Who fandom's initial {{response}} to the serial was not so positive; John Peel, writing in the fanzine TARDIS in 1979, decried it as [...] "total farce... I simply couldn't believe this was Doctor Who... the continual buffoonery is getting on my nerves". A similar view was held by Gary Russell who, reviewing the VHS release in 1991, said, [...] "City of Death, like most Douglas Adams material, is overrated and misses the mark for me, falling between the stools of good pastiche and bad parody and making fairly unsatisfactory viewing". This line was countered by Vanessa Bishop who called it [...] "the Doctor Who story it's alright to laugh at... we must now accept that City of Death is funny— because if we didn't the Crackerjack-style sleuths, scientists and all... would leave it knocking about {{near the bottom of}} all the Doctor Who story ranking polls" [...] and, responding to the criticisms about the levels of comedy, that [...] "it's precisely these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> it seem so special". Reviewing the serial in 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times stated he disliked the smug tone to the humour and Ward's [...] "snooty" [...] portrayal of Romana. Despite this, he noted that the serial had good production values and direction, as well as a few jokes that he enjoyed.|$|E
