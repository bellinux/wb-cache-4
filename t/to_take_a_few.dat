5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1576, Boy led the {{construction}} of the palace that preceded the extant Baroque version of the Drottningholm Palace. The royal mansion named Torvesund on the location was rebuilt into a palace by King John III, who was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rooms in possession in 1580, and {{the construction}} seems to have been complete four years later, save for the adornment of the interior.|$|E
25|$|The mooted Flanders Offensive {{was then}} {{cancelled}} altogether after further lobbying of Kitchener by Joffre and Millerand, who visited England especially {{to demand that}} the BEF instead take over more French line. Sir John agreed (15 January), {{as soon as he}} was reinforced, to relieve two French corps north of Ypres to allow Joffre to build up French reserves for his own offensive. Murray was sent off sick for a month (24 January) and French demanded his resignation, despite Murray insisting that he only needed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days off. Robertson replaced him.|$|E

25|$|Murray {{was sent}} off sick {{for a month}} (24 January 1915) and French demanded his {{resignation}} (25 January 1915), despite Murray insisting that he only needed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days off. Wilson was widely suspected of having plotted for Murray's removal in the vain hope of replacing him, but the job went to Robertson. Although a sore throat prevented him seeing Murray off, French wrote to him (29 January) saying he hoped to see him back as an army commander before long. Haig wrote (diary 26 January) that “Murray was a kindly fellow but not a practical man in the field”.|$|E
25|$|Brynner began smoking heavily at age 12, and {{although}} his promotional photos often showed {{him with a}} cigarette in hand, he quit the habit in 1971. In September 1983, he found a lump on his vocal cords. In Los Angeles, only hours before his 4,000th performance in The King and I, he received the test results indicating that while his throat was fine, he had inoperable lung cancer. He and the national tour of the musical were forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months off while he underwent radiation therapy, which hurt his throat and {{made it impossible for}} him to sing or speak easily. The tour then resumed.|$|E
25|$|Given this history, it {{is almost}} certain {{that none of the}} four gospels were written by eyewitnesses. Evidence of this {{can be seen in the}} {{conflicts}} between them: <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> examples, according to the synoptic gospels, Jesus' mission took one year, was spent primarily in Galilee, and climaxed with a single visit to Jerusalem at which he cleansed the Temple of the money-changers, while in John, Jerusalem was the focus of Jesus' mission, he visited it three times (making his mission last three years rather than one), and the cleansing of the Temple took place at the beginning rather than the end of the ministry.|$|E

25|$|After seizing Garmsir, the Marines pushed {{further south}} {{into an area}} where the insurgents had built bunkers and tunnels capable of {{withstanding}} coalition airstrikes. They ran into stiff resistance and the operation, expected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, lasted more than a month to complete. This alerted the ISAF commander that the town was important to the insurgents, so he ordered the Marines to remain in the area, rather than clear the town and leave. He was also concerned that the Taliban would emerge after the Marines left, falsely claiming that they had run ISAF forces off. With the original mission changed, the Marines transitioned from combat operations to civil operations. The 24th MEU commander Colonel Peter Petronzio focused on protecting the local Afghans as they began {{to return to their homes}} after having been displaced by the Taliban. The Marines also continued their combat operations in the area, killing more than 400 insurgents between April and July 2008, according to governor Gulab Mangal.|$|E

500|$|The Sixth Cavalry's horses arrived {{soon after}} the battle, and the {{regiment}} {{was transferred to the}} cavalry brigade of Colonel William H. [...] "Red" [...] Jackson. Ross was permitted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks leave in November 1862 to visit his wife, and returned to his regiment in mid-January 1863. Several months later, his unit participated in the Battle of Thompson's Station. In July, Major General Stephen D. Lee created a new brigade with Ross at the helm; consisting of Ross's regiment and Colonel Richard A. Pinson's First Mississippi Cavalry. Near the same time, Ross received word that his first child had died, possibly stillborn.|$|E

500|$|The Guardians Caroline Sullivan first criticized Cruz for his evident [...] "facelessness" [...] in {{his music}} while {{reviewing}} his album; she, however, {{wrote that the}} song [...] "saves the day" [...] and wrote that it exemplified [...] "British humour by impersonating a camera ('Snap, snap, click!')." [...] Sara Anderson from AOL Radio was positive in her review of the song. Anderson wrote, [...] "Building from strobing, techno back beats, Taio melodically, and bluntly, asks his muse <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> er, risque pictures for him, before transitioning into speaking voice {{with the help of}} party queen Kesha."

500|$|In Prima Games' {{official}} {{guide for}} the 2011's Mortal Kombat reboot, Mileena was judged to be well-balanced and universal, displaying neither particular weaknesses nor advantages {{that would result in}} a one-sided battle against anyone else. In their test, Mileena always won around half of fights against any character (in the range of 40–60%, wins depending on an opposing character). In Mortal Kombat X, Mileena's style of fighting is translated into her three variations: [...] "Ravenous", [...] "Piercing", and [...] "Ethereal". In [...] "Ravenous", as the name suggests, Mileena gains an expanded number of biting and pouncing attacks, highlighting her beastly and cannibalistic tendencies and turning her into a more aggressive fighter. In [...] "Piercing", her main trait is her sai, which she uses for both projectiles and extensive combination attacks. Her [...] "Ethereal" [...] variation focuses on her ability to teleport, and allows her to disappear for extended periods of time in order to strike stealthily. Prima evaluated her as a [...] "solid character" [...] with [...] "several great ways to stop opponents from jumping toward her," [...] but who is [...] "not as safe as some of the other characters, which means she has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> risks." ...|$|E
