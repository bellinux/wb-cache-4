5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians, thus {{protecting}} <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> {{of the forces}} at Thermopylae. Here the Allied fleet held off the Persians for three days; however, on the third evening the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allied troops at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> of Thermopylae, the Allies retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5000|$|... “By {{standing}} close, the five-eighth {{ensures that}} he draws <b>the</b> open-side <b>flanker.</b> Any five-eighth standing close {{will look like}} a sitting duck to <b>the</b> <b>flanker,</b> who is therefore keyed up to flatten him. This is just what the five-eighth wants. Provided he runs fairly straight, <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> {{will not be able}} to resist coming at him, and at the appropriate moment, having drawn <b>the</b> <b>flanker,</b> <b>the</b> five-eighth passes to the inside-centre. The moment this happens <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> is out of the game, for he now has to turn around and chase. On the other hand, if the five-eighth stands wide or if he does not run fairly straight, <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> can approach him at an angle. If the five-eighth then unloads, <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> can continue on the same angle and nail the inside centre.” ...|$|R
50|$|A running {{play that}} is run from a set with a flanker {{receiver}} split {{out to the}} side away from the play, often run with <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> in motion. <b>The</b> quarterback receives the snap and runs out to <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> side, <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> in turn makes a deep arc into the backfield behind the quarterback, and then there is an exchange either by handoff or by pitching the ball to <b>the</b> <b>flanker.</b> Flanker Sweep typically resembles the Student Body Right in that every available blocker blocks to the playside.|$|R

In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson.|$|E
50|$|A {{flanking}} maneuver is {{not always}} effective, as <b>the</b> <b>flanking</b> force may itself be ambushed while maneuvering, or the main force is unable to pin the defenders in place, allowing them to turn and face <b>the</b> <b>flanking</b> attack.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} a patient with right neglect (M. A. H.) across various manipulations of <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> paradigm. When required to identify a central target {{in the presence of a}} unilateral flanker, M. A. H. responded to <b>the</b> <b>flanking</b> distractor on <b>the</b> left (ipsilesional) side as if it were the target, even when <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> appeared at left peripheral locations. A right (contralesional) flanker did not affect central identification performance (Experiment 1). The "ipsilesional capture" effect persisted when pretrial location markers were introduced to make <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> and target locations more clearly defined (Experiment 2). However, when <b>the</b> ipsilesional <b>flanker</b> appeared simultaneously with a contralesional flanker, central target detection improved to ceiling (Experiment 3). Interestingly, with these three-stimulus displays, congruency effects in reaction time only occurred in relation to <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> on <b>the</b> contralesional side (Experiment 3), suggesting impaired response selectivity to ipsilesional stimuli. Congruency effects were produced on both sides only when <b>the</b> two <b>flanking</b> distractors grouped together (by both onset and offset, Experiment 4) and when <b>the</b> ipsilesional <b>flanking</b> distractor grouped with the target by onset (lone contra offset, Experiment 4). The results are attributed to ipsilesional capture in central target detection, which is offset by temporal grouping processes when another stimulus appears on the contralateral side...|$|R

5|$|Following {{this the}} commandos were used mainly as highly trained {{infantry}} units {{for the rest}} of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols. Indicative of the nature of the fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00am, as three troops—Nos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops—attacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a diversionary attack from <b>the</b> <b>flank.</b> As soon as the main force left its line of departure it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a diamond-shaped perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the afternoon when it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised.|$|E
5|$|From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn. The old pony route took a {{very safe}} and steady route {{for the benefit of}} early visitors, who took horses and a guide from the inn. The route {{traverses}} <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> of White Side to join the ridge at the col just below Lower Man. The other route, known as the White Stones Route, originally marked by stones painted white, crosses the fellside at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from Swirls.|$|E
5|$|Half of the regiment's {{strength}} {{was ordered to}} retreat from its position before the North Korean force was encountered, leaving <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> open for the remaining force, 1st Battalion at Pyongtaek. The battalion encountered North Korean forces the morning of July 6, and after a brief fight, was unable to repel them effectively. The battalion then mounted a disorganized retreat to Cheonan several miles away, having failed to significantly delay the North Korean forces in their movement south.|$|E

5|$|Phase 2: Vahan, {{noticing the}} huge cavalry {{maneuver}} of the Muslims, ordered his cavalry to group together, {{but was not}} quick enough; before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the front and <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> {{while they were still}} moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate.|$|E

40|$|The present {{work was}} aimed at {{investigating}} whether <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> compatibility effect can be eliminated {{by means of a}} posthypnotic suggestion influencing attentional focusing. In Experiment 1, participants who scored high and low on hypnotic susceptibility performed <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> compatibility task when naturally awake and when under a posthypnotic suggestion aimed at increasing the target's discriminability from the flankers. Results showed that the posthypnotic suggestion effectively eliminated <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> compatibility effect in highly susceptible participants, whereas low-susceptibility participants did not show any reduction in the effect. In Experiment 2, highly susceptible participants performed the task after receiving a suggestion but without the induction of hypnosis.

These results support the view that in highly susceptible participants, hypnotic suggestion can influence the ability to focus on relevant information...|$|R
