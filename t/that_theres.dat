6000|$|WALPOLE. He's {{all right}} {{as to the}} cheque, for a while at all events. He talked to me quite frankly before dinner as to the {{pressure}} of money difficulties on an artist. He {{says he has no}} vices and is very economical, but <b>that</b> <b>theres</b> one extravagance he cant afford and yet cant resist; and that is dressing his wife prettily. So I said, bang plump out, [...] "Let me lend you twenty pounds, and pay me when your ship comes home." [...] He was really very nice about it. He took it like a man; and it was a pleasure to see how happy it made him, poor chap.|$|E

50|$|The BC Refederation Party argues <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are three}} {{constitutional}} flaws in Canada.

5000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to put it in a phrase, but it has been put in this way: <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be aberration or weakness of mind; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be some form of mental unsoundness; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be a state of mind which is bordering on, though not amounting to, insanity; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be a mind so affected that responsibility is diminished from full responsibility to partial responsibility. In other words, the prisoner in question must be only partially accountable for his actions. And I think one can see running through the cases <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is implied ... <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be some form of mental disease.|$|R

Not <b>that</b> <b>theres</b> any mystery about it: don't think that. Of course you know by your mother's being in it that it's perfectly straight and honest. I've known her for many years; and I can say of her that she'd cut off her hands sooner than touch anything {{that was not what}} it ought to be. I'll {{tell you all about it}} if you like. I don't know whether you've found in travelling how hard it is to find a really comfortable private hotel.|$|E
60|$|THE SHERIFF [rising solemnly] Silence there. Wait a bit. I {{take it that}} if the Sheriff is {{satisfied}} {{and the owner of}} the horse {{is satisfied}}, theres no more to be said. I have had to remark on former occasions that what is wrong with this court is <b>that</b> <b>theres</b> too many Sheriffs in it. To-day {{there is going to be}} one, and only one; and that one is your humble servant. I call that to the notice of the Foreman of the jury, and also to the notice of young Strapper. I am also the owner of the horse. Does any man say that I am not? [Silence]. Very well, then. In my opinion, to commandeer a horse for the purpose of getting a dying child to a doctor is not stealing, provided, as in the present case, that the horse is returned safe and sound. I rule that there has been no theft.|$|E
