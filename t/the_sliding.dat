5|$|Most {{histories}} of professional Australian sculling commence with this event. By 1877, Australia had a vigorous interest in sport, and {{a class of}} professional athletes was emerging. Far from defeating him, the match of 30 June 1877 gave Rush new energy. After {{a year or two}} of retirement, he began to train and compete, mastering <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> seat. He regained his Australian Championship in September 1881.|$|E
50|$|The take-down lever {{is used to}} lock <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> back (as <b>the</b> Browning Hi-Power {{safety is}} used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> release lever. In later variants, this lever is omitted and <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> must be manually aligned to remove <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> release lever. Once <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> release lever {{and allow it to}} drop free. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|R
5000|$|The pistol is {{disassembled}} {{by removing}} the magazine, cocking the hammer and putting the safety in the [...] "safe" [...] position. A notch inside {{the front of the}} trigger guard at <b>the</b> frame must <b>slide</b> down and be held in position while moving <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> slightly forward and then up to detach it from the frame. The barrel can now be removed from <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> To reassemble <b>the</b> pistol, insert the barrel back in <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> Place <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> into <b>the</b> guides in the frame. Move <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to <b>the</b> rear to re-seat <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and lock it in the rearward position on the frame. Pulling the trigger releases <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> into <b>the</b> neutral position.|$|R
50|$|Field {{stripping}} {{is accomplished}} by locking <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to <b>the</b> rear, rotating the takedown lever clockwise ninety degrees and releasing <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> stop while carefully allowing <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to be pushed forward out of the frame. The barrel and recoil spring then separate from <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to complete <b>the</b> disassembly procedure.|$|R
5|$|Neither the {{clockwork}} {{visible to}} {{the left side of the}} machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. <b>The</b> <b>sliding</b> of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Post-Olympic usage is a {{responsibility}} of the Whistler 2010 Sports Legacies which operates <b>the</b> <b>Sliding</b> Centre, Whistler Olympic Park, and the Whistler Olympic and Paralympic Village. The goal of this organization is to promote {{the legacy of the}} 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics, promote healthy lifestyles and tourism in the British Columbia province, and offer revenue for the maintenance of the three facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{school is}} funded through tuition, grants, and donations. The {{majority}} of students come from middle-class families from Brooklyn. The private school has sliding-scale tuition, and less than half pay full tuition. Founding director Alan Berger said that 20 percent paid full tuition in 2012. In 2015, about a third paid less than $500 in tuition, and another third paid half tuition. <b>The</b> <b>sliding</b> scale's full tuition is set at $22,000.|$|E
50|$|Using an aseptic technique, {{bacteria}} {{are placed on}} a slide and heat fixed. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is then suspended over a water bath {{with some sort of}} porus paper over it, so that <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is steamed. Malachite green is applied to <b>the</b> <b>slide,</b> which can penetrate the tough walls of the endospores, staining them green. After five minutes, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is removed from the steam, and the paper towel is removed. After cooling, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is rinsed with water for thirty seconds. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is then stained with diluted safranin for two minutes, which stains most other microorganic bodies red or pink. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is then rinsed again, and blotted dry with bibulous paper.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is {{released}} and driven {{forward by the}} return spring, stripping a round from the magazine and feeding it into the chamber. As soon as the cartridge is lined up with the chamber the extractor grips the [...] and the gun fires while <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is still moving forward. The firing impulse retards the forward movement of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and drives it back. The extractor grips the empty case until the ejector pushes it through the ejection port in the right of <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> continues to <b>the</b> rear and the return spring, located under the barrel, is fully compressed. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> rides over a retarder lever which snaps up and holds <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> to <b>the</b> rear. The rate-reducing device, an inertia buffer {{in the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>slide,</b> continues rearward under its own momentum and compresses the buffer spring. When the spring is fully compressed it throws the retarder forward and this pushes the retarder lever down out of engagement with <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> and, provided <b>the</b> trigger is still depressed and ammunition remains in <b>the</b> magazine, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> goes forward to repeat the firing cycle.|$|R
5000|$|Refer to the {{photographs}} on this page... On {{the right side}} of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is marked [...] "Sig-Sauer System Made in W. Germany." [...] On the left side of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is [...] "Browning Arms Co. Morgan Utah & Montreal, P.Q." [...] On the Breech block right side is marked the caliber the barrel is chambered in. The proof markings are on the under side of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> which is visible only when <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is in battery.

5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the friction between <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.|$|E
5|$|Site {{construction}} of the facility began on 1 June 2005 following environmental approval from the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Safety and security was then put in place on the site. During its peak of construction activities {{in the summer of}} 2006, more than 500 workers were involved both at <b>the</b> <b>Sliding</b> Centre and at the Whistler Nordic Venue (now Whistler Olympic Park). A core group of 60 workers was involved with track construction from June 2005 to December 2007. Basic track construction was completed in November 2007 though fit-out and testing continued into 2008.|$|E
5|$|South Wales miners, {{including}} those at Universal, were paid on a rate determined by <b>the</b> <b>Sliding</b> Scale Committee, which fixed wages {{on the price}} coal fetched at market. When the price of coal slumped in the late 1890s, low wages led to industrial unrest and, in 1898, a strike that the men at Universal joined {{at the end of}} April. The Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association refused to replace the scale, and the strike ended on 1 September with some small concessions granted by the owners. The colliery resumed production and in 1899 was producing 3,000 long tons (3,400short tons) of coal a week.|$|E
50|$|A lap steel guitar is {{a guitar}} {{played on the}} lap with a steel. It is similar to <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> or {{bottleneck}} style with the guitar held in regular position. The steel allows {{for the use of}} slant bar techniques not available on <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> guitar. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> guitar allows for the use of fingers on the neck in addition to <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b>|$|R
5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> handle released <b>the</b> action <b>slide</b> lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> handle and released <b>the</b> action <b>slide</b> lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release <b>the</b> action <b>slide</b> lock.|$|R
50|$|The various terms {{relate to}} the two {{functions}} of the component: while it automatically catches <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> (locking it back) after the magazine's last round has been fired, thereby allowing the user to easily release <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> by pulling down on the switch, it also allows the user to purposefully stop or lock <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> back by pressing up on the switch while racking <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b>|$|R
5|$|Team Canada (luge) did not {{participate}} in the World Cup event in Lillehammer, Norway during 12–13 December 2009 to train at <b>the</b> <b>Sliding</b> Centre and to compete at the Canadian National Championships that took place on 17 December 2009. A training restriction went into effect on 31 December 2009 where only host nation Canada and athletes from developing nations were allowed to train before the 2010 Games. For the 2009–10 season, there were a total of 15736 runs among bobsleigh (2512), luge (8794), and skeleton (4070) with a total of 115 crashes among the three sliding disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E
50|$|Whereas the {{majority}} of treatises indicate <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> is to begin on the beat, Donington notes that Johann Gottfried Walther (1708) believed <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> should occur prior to the beat. Frederick Neumann (in 1973) indicates {{that any of the}} 3 notes of a 3-note slide could occur on the beat, but did not cite any sources to support this. By 1993, he stated that <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> could occur only before or on the beat (i.e. the last note of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> on <b>the</b> beat, or the first note of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> on <b>the</b> beat).|$|R
50|$|The Ahole Holua Complex is a holua slide {{located on}} Ahole Bay on the {{southwest}} {{side of the island}} of Hawaii. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> was used in the Native Hawaiian sport of holua, in which upper-class men raced toboggans down lava slides covered in slippery grasses. Stone platforms along the side of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> allowed spectators to watch <b>the</b> races. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> consists of a 60 m slope and a 23 m runway; the slope and length of <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> indicate that <b>the</b> Native Hawaiians had developed advanced engineering skills. <b>The</b> <b>slide</b> is among <b>the</b> best-preserved holua <b>slides</b> in Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|On most designs, {{once the}} {{magazine}} and chamber both are empty, <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> will lock back, released only when <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> stop is depressed; if a new magazine is inserted before <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> stop is depressed then a new cartridge will be chambered.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{speculation}} about potential medal winners before the Games focused on athletes from Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. Athletes from German-speaking countries had traditionally been dominant in <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> sports, luge and bobsleigh, but following the re-introduction of skeleton, {{they had not}} been as strongly competitive in the new sport. Mellisa Hollingsworth of Canada, the defending Olympic bronze medalist, won the 2009-10 Skeleton World Cup, and was considered a strong contender if not the favorite to win. British athlete Shelley Rudman won the only British medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics with her silver in skeleton, and her bronze medal at the European Championships just prior to the Games kept her name in media previews of the Olympic event. Her countrywoman Amy Williams, however, finished outside of the medal places in both the World Cup, in which she placed fifth, and the European Championships, in which she placed sixth. American Noelle Pikus-Pace {{had not been able to}} compete in the 2006 Games after a runaway bobsleigh had broken her leg.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset <b>the</b> <b>sliding</b> door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E
