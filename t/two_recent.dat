Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita {{subgenus}} Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. <b>Two</b> <b>recent</b> molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1953, Oppenheimer {{was told}} by Lewis Strauss that his {{security}} file had been subject to <b>two</b> <b>recent</b> re-evaluations because of new screening criteria, and because a former government official had drawn attention to Oppenheimer's record. Strauss said that his clearance had been suspended, pending resolution {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Given only a day to decide, and after consulting with his lawyers, Oppenheimer chose not to resign, and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, general manager of the AEC. Pending resolution of the charges, Oppenheimer's security clearance was suspended. Oppenheimer told Strauss that some of what was in Nichols' letter was correct, some incorrect.|$|E
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>recent</b> discoveries {{indicate}} probable {{very early}} settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, {{the remains of}} a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. Dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca. 1500 BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge. The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames.|$|E

This paper proposes two types of black-box model obtained by using multiple regression analysis and backpropagation neural networks in forecasting 6 -h water levels at three important stations on the upstream section of the Red River basin, North Vietnam. The results obtained show that highly accurate forecast values can be obtained with lead times of up to 18 h by using <b>two</b> most <b>recent</b> past values of the water level at the station considered or <b>two</b> most <b>recent</b> past values at this station and <b>two</b> most <b>recent</b> values of an upstream station...|$|R
