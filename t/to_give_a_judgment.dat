Results of Altman discriminant analysis indicate that the bankrupt company category counts to 1 companies because of the incapability to produce profit, the low capability of guaranteeing liquidity rate, the less maximally resource management and the low company activity ratio. The category of decrement and recovery shows up 2 companies. Non-bankrupt category accounts to 1 companies because of the company capability to manage the resource to produce necessarily profit and to guarantee the company liquidity. Some suggestions may be given that the company in the bankrupt category should improve its liquidity rate by maximizing the marketing division to increase the sale.

40|$|Background: In {{conservative}} breast surgery, {{the achievement}} of a satisfactory cosmetic result could be challenging; oncoplastic techniques may be helpful in many cases. A comparative analysis was performed among 3 groups of patients undergoing oncoplastic techniques plus external radiation therapy or intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and breast conservative surgery plus external radiation therapy; long-term oncologic results in terms of disease relapse and aesthetic outcomes were compared. Methods: Ninety-six patients were considered: 32 patients treated with oncoplastic surgery, 16 then subjected to radiotherapy (group 1) and another 16 treated with IORT (group 2); 64 patients treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy formed the control group (group 3). Patients were asked <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> on the cosmetic result considering the following parameters: breast symmetry, appearance of the residual scar, symmetry between the 2 nipple-areola complexes, global aesthetic judgment, and satisfaction about the result. Results: With respect to the oncological and aesthetic outcome, the statistical significance of the results obtained in the 3 groups was calculated using the chi-square test. The results, processed by the chi-square test, were not statistically significant; however, the overall judgments expressed by the patients of all 3 groups were more than satisfactory (scores {{greater than or equal}} to 6). Conclusions: In our experience, when the inclusion criteria are satisfied and the equipment is available, oncoplastic techniques associated with IORT should be considered the treatment of choice for breast cancer in early stage.

40|$|Spectra of Stimuli (in dB SPL) In the {{experiment}} we proof the paradoxical perception of pitch. A tone sequence demonstrates this paradox: the sequence {{is perceived as}} descending, although {{the first and last}} tone are identical. The intransitivity of pitch perception generalizes (Shepard 1964). It applies also to harmonic complex tones with variate amplitude envelope and partials that are arranged in intervals different from octaves. The paradox perception in this experiment {{as well as in the}} Shepard scale is modeled by a formula (spectrum of pitch differences) that extends the virtual pitch algorithm (Terhardt 1998) to pitch intervals. Experiment: Judgment on Pitch Comparison Circular structures A relation ‘ ’ is termed circular, if there are elements with. In contrast to a linear order ‘ ’ is not transitive. The paradox of our experiments is based on this circularity and intransitivity of pitch relation. According to common notion any tone is assigned to one pitch on a linear scale. Pitch relation is thus identified with ‘ ’ resp. ‘ ’ for real numbers. But this order is linear and transitive and thereby- as we will see- in contradiction to our experiments. Description of the Experiment The stimuli consist of tone pairs. Six tone pairs form a logical block. To each tone pair there exists another tone pair in reverse order. In addition every tone pair exists in 9 transpositions. One block contains six distinct harmonic complex tones (cf. Figure 1). Those are combined to six tone pairs: 1 with 2; 2 with 3; [...] .; 5 with 6; 6 with 1. Each of the 18 subjects has <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> on pitch comparison to each tone pair: 1) ‘first tone higher’, 2) ‘second tone higher’, 3) ‘both tones are equal’, 4) ‘undecidable’.

40|$|The work-family {{reconciliation}} is {{a fundamental}} theme in the political debate; the EU is infact facing a huge dilemma {{in terms of social}} policy: It requires to increase employment rates to ensure both economic growth and sustainability of welfare systems, while also promoting social inclusion in a context characterized by high complexification, especially in intergenerational perspective. In this frame is fundamental the contribution of the companies which, according to a vision of Corporate Citizenship, are strategic actors in the process of lifetimes’ arrangement. The paper will present the results of a national survey carried out on behalf of the National Observatory on the Family-Department for Family Policies, aimed at identifying some company good practices of work-family reconciliation. Italian companies involved in the work-family reconciliation have been mapped with a quantitative methodology; then were identified some promising practices and case studies have been made. For each case study were carried out in-depth interviews with the company management (HR, CSR, Diversity managers [...] .), and focus groups with employees of different occupational profile, age and sex who were {{able to take advantage of}} the reconciling measures. In the interviews with employees we have tried to understand whether the reconciliation measures provided by company were actually useful for them to reconcile the different commitments of life.

The survey so allowed to highlight the complexity of work-family reconciliation in turbulent times and also the bond with the process of structuring of personal identity: reconcile family and work does not implies for people to hold together and harmonize different times (the time of the family and the time of work) but especially <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> regarding themselves as a person in their lives.

After 2 weeks we interviewed one-third of the participants according to the guidelines of the CI, one-third according to a Standard Interview (SI), and one-third were not interviewed at all (Control condition).

40|$|From a phenomenological perspective, {{faces are}} {{perceived}} differently from objects as their perception always involves {{the possibility of}} a relational engagement (Bredlau, 2011). This is especially true for familiar faces, i. e. faces of people with a history of real relational engagements. Similarly, valence of emotional expressions assumes a key role, as they define the sense and direction of this engagement. Following these premises, the aim of the present study is to demonstrate that face recognition is facilitated by at least two variables, familiarity and emotional expression, and that perception of familiar faces is not influenced by orientation. In order to verify this hypothesis, we implemented a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial design, showing seventeen healthy subjects three type of faces (unfamiliar, personally familiar, famous) characterized by three different emotional expressions (happy, hungry/sad, neutral) and in two different orientation (upright vs inverted). We showed every subject a total of 180 faces with the instructions <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> familiarity <b>judgment.</b> Reaction times were recorded and we found that the recognition of a face is facilitated by personal familiarity and emotional expression, and that this process is otherwise independent from a cognitive elaboration of stimuli and remains stable despite orientation. These results highlight the need to make a distinction between famous and personally familiar faces when studying face perception and to consider its historical aspects from a phenomenological point of view...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of test format on recollection and familiarity in normal aging and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods. Seventy young participants (18 - 30 years), 65 “younger-old” (55 - 69 years), 53 “older-old” (70 - 85 years), and 13 MCIs (55 - 82 years) were enrolled. In the “forced-choice” task, they had to recognize which picture, among three, was presented during the encoding stage. In the “yes/no” task, they had to judge whether each item, successively presented, was previously seen or not. In each task, they had <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> “Remember/Know/Guess” <b>judgment.</b> Results. Group × Format repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that young people had better recognition performance (d’) than “younger-old”, which were better than “older-old” and MCIs. Moreover, young people used familiarity more accurately than both groups of old participants and MCIs, with MCIs being equivalent to “younger-old” and “older-old”. However, MCIs displayed a high rate of familiarity-based false alarms. The resort to recollection decreased with age and in MCIs. Finally, Group × Format interaction revealed that young people (but not the other groups) could use recollection more often in the “forcedchoice” task compared to the “yes/no” task. Conclusions.

Within each group/farm ANOVA was performed and the means were analysed by t Student test. In each group the mean value and the percentage of subjects with an intercalving period lower than 400 days (% < 400 days) were calculated and the regression analysis was carried out between the values of the intercalving periods and the % < 400 days. Finally, an all-in regression analysis was performed by using the data of 55 groups, excluding those with less than 25 values. The regression analysis between % < 400 days and the mean value of the intercalving period was always significant, except in one case. The comparison between the real values and those calculated allows to affirm that, if the percentage of subjects with an intercalving period lower than 400 days is higher than 50 %, an intercalving period lower than 450 days will be probably recorded...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{conceived}} that children learn new objects through their affordances, that is, {{the actions that}} can be taken on them. We suggest that web pages also have affordances defined in terms of the users' information need they meet. An assumption of the proposed approach is that different parts of a text may not be equally important / relevant <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> query. <b>Judgment</b> on the relevance of a web document requires, therefore, a thorough look into its parts, rather than treating it as a monolithic content. We propose a method to extract and assign affordances to texts and then use these affordances to retrieve the corresponding web pages. The overall approach presented in the paper relies on case-based representations that bridge the queries to the affordances of web documents. We tested our method on the tourism domain and the results are promising. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, WebCBR 2010, Alessandria, Ital...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{many years}} of experience in process design and methodology implementation for sustainable innovation development as carried out by the authors within several innovation projects in different industries (e. g. fixed and mobile telecommunications, high tech, logistics). We have developed a research innovation approach which provide effective innovation intelligence and scouting through the use of technology and innovation radars. These instruments enable the identification and evaluation of emerging business and technology trends, provide an overview of the relative maturity and assess their relevance to the company. A rating mechanism helps companies to decide when to adopt an innovation and to develop new products and services. Furthermore, the technology and innovation radars are good strategic tools for early stage identification and prioritization in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>an</b> approximate value <b>judgment</b> without detailed return-on-investment justifications. In later stages of the planning process, the radar tools {{can be used as a}} high-level summary of an underlying prioritization process.

But there is no necessity that I should be found in its path. And I may pray, and I will pray, that God may so guide and govern my voyage, and all its little accidents, that I may pass it by. I know that I can forecast the storm somewhat; and if I {{do not try to}} do that, I am tempting God: but I may pray, I will pray, that my forecast may be correct. I will pray the Spirit of God, who <b>gives</b> man understanding, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me <b>a</b> right <b>judgment,</b> <b>a</b> sound mind, and a calm heart, that I may make no mistake and neglect no precaution; and if I fail, and sink--God's will be done. It is a good will to me and all my crew; and {{into the hands of the}} good God who has redeemed me, I commend my spirit, and their spirits likewise.|$|R
