500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Malay and Islam became the {{national}} language and official religion, while the Malay rulers remained. This {{was taken to}} mean that the Malays were accorded deference as the definitive people of Malaya — i.e. being a Malayan {{would be the same}} as being a Malay — and in the eyes of many, gave Malaya a Malay identity. One academic suggested that [...] "The Malays have a deep-rooted feeling that they alone are the bumiputras, the sons of the soil, and as such have certain special rights over the land." [...] Indeed, the Tunku said in 1964 that [...] "It is understood by all that <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>by</b> its very name, its traditions and character, is Malay. ... In any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields, eventually there is bitter opposition from the indigenous people. But not with the Malays. Therefore, in return, they must appreciate the position of the Malays..." [...] It has been suggested that a Malaysian nationality did not emerge because [...] "all the national symbols in Malaysia were derived from the Malay tradition".|$|E
500|$|During the {{ratification}} debates {{that took place}} in the states following the convention, Gerry continued his opposition, publishing a widely circulated letter documenting his objections to the proposed constitution. [...] In this document he cited the lack of a Bill of Rights as his primary objection, but also expressed qualified approval of the constitution, indicating that he would accept it with some amendment. [...] Strong pro-Constitution forces attacked him in the press, comparing him unfavorably to the Shaysites. [...] Henry Jackson was particularly vicious: [...] " [...] done more injury to <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>by</b> that infamous Letter than he will be able to make atonement in his whole life", and Oliver Ellsworth, a convention delegate from Connecticut, charged him with deliberately courting the Shays faction. [...] One consequence of the furor over his letter was that he was not selected as a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was later invited to attend by the convention's leadership. [...] The convention leadership was dominated by Federalists, and Gerry was not given any formal opportunity to speak; he left the convention after a shouting match with convention chair Francis Dana. [...] The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. [...] The debate had the result of estranging Gerry from a number of previously friendly politicians, including chairman Dana and Rufus King.|$|E

2500|$|Some economists {{believe that}} Standard Oil {{was not a}} monopoly, and also argue that the intense free market {{competition}} resulted in cheaper oil prices and more diverse petroleum products. Critics claimed that success in meeting consumer needs was driving other companies {{out of the market}} who were not as successful. An example of this thinking was given in 1890 when Rep. William Mason, arguing in favor of the Sherman Antitrust Act, said: [...] "trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>by</b> the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise".|$|E

Subsequently, Krishna Varma {{used his}} considerable {{financial resources to}} offer scholarships to Indian students in memory of leaders of the 1857 uprising, {{on the condition that}} the recipients would not accept any paid post or honorary office from the British Raj upon their return home. These scholarships were complemented by three endowments of 2000 Rupees courtesy S.R. Rana, in memory of Rana Pratap Singh. Open to [...] "Indians only", the IHRS garnered significant support from Indians– especially students– living in Britain. Funds received by Indian students as scholarships and bursaries from universities also found their way to the organisation.
