5|$|Prior {{to being}} under State control, the section between Sears Point and Vallejo {{was known as}} the Sears Point <b>Toll</b> <b>Road,</b> a <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> managed by Golden Gate Ferry that was built over an ancient Native American trail. When it was {{purchased}} by the State in 1938, tolls were removed; it then became signed as State Route 48 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} a <b>toll</b> <b>road,</b> and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) {{for a person}} on foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and {{it appears to have}} been Perth's only <b>toll</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in the United States; , <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> exist in 35 states, with the {{majority}} of states without any <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> being in the West and South. In 2015, there were 5000 mi of <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in the country.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, Missouri legislators have been {{considering}} whether the state should implement <b>toll</b> <b>roads.</b> Historically, Missouri and other states have funded transportation projects on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, paying for construction, maintenance and administration as money became available from traditional user fees such as gas tax revenues and registration fees. Today, however, there are <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in 29 states and they bring in approximately $ 4 billion a year. Given Missouri's current situation with transportation financing, <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> might be one avenue in addressing some of our highway needs. <b>Toll</b> <b>roads,</b> however, should not {{been seen as a}} panacea for financing all of our transportation needs. <b>Toll</b> <b>roads</b> are typically not very popularwith Missouri voters, and since all roads in Missouri cannot become <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are at best a limited source of new revenue...|$|R
40|$|California has {{authorized}} four <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> to {{be constructed}} {{and operated by}} private groups, and it is considering more. Construction on a similar 14 -mile project in Virginia will begin in 1992. Florida, Texas, and Colorado are considering proposals for private <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> and {{there is talk of}} a 500 -mile private connection between Chicago and Kansas City. Outside the United States, private groups are operating <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in France and Italy. Indeed, the idea of private <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> is making a comeback. We say "comeback" because many regions of the United States were once laced with private <b>toll</b> <b>roads.</b> In the early 1800 s turnpiking was the leading form of transportation improvement. At mid-century an elaborate system of short turnpikes and plank roads served as feeders to the canals and railroads. In Colorado and California private <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> served the early mining camps. By the year 1900 scores of rustic <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> continued to traverse rural areas nation-wide. During the 19 th century at least 2, 000 private companies operated <b>toll</b> <b>roads...</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for its <b>toll</b> <b>road.</b> When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> further.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{plans were}} made for a limited-access Relief Route of US 13 between Dover and the Wilmington area that would {{alleviate}} it of traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer. This Relief Route would become designated as part of DE 1, a route that ran along the Atlantic Ocean in Sussex County and north to Milford. The DE 1 <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in stages between 1991 and 2003. The total cost to build the DE 1 <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> was $900 million {{and it was the}} largest public works project in Delaware history.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1932, the California State Highway Commission {{received}} a recommendation {{to purchase the}} road {{and was able to}} invest $418,000USD by 1936. However, the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right-of-way of part of the route, and opposed the purchase. This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route. House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> in order to convert it into a toll-free highway. He argued that having only one <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters; he also cited the ten and seventh-tenths-mile difference in distance between the <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> and a route through Napa. A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26, 1938. The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering.|$|E

50|$|The more {{traditional}} means of managing <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in the United States is through semi-autonomous public authorities. Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia manage their <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in this manner. While {{most of the}} <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in California, Delaware, Florida, Texas, and Virginia are operating under the BOT arrangement, {{a few of the}} older <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> in these states are still operated by public authorities.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are privately owned and operated. Others {{are owned by}} the government. Some of the government-owned <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are privately operated.|$|R
5|$|State Route 133 (SR 133) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. It connects SR 1 in Laguna Beach through the San Joaquin Hills with several freeways in Irvine, ending at the SR 241 <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> in the latter city. It is built as an {{expressway}} from SR 73 to Laguna Canyon Road (just south of I-405 in Irvine). SR 133 is a freeway (the Laguna Freeway) to I-5, and a tollway (part of the Eastern <b>Toll</b> <b>Road)</b> to SR 241 near the Santa Ana Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> as the primary route to Aspen within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would {{serve as the basis for}} the highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} US44 between Poughkeepsie and Amenia {{was the main}} line of an early <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> known as the Dutchess Turnpike. The turnpike {{continued}} past Amenia into the Connecticut town of Sharon along modern NY343. Between the Wallkill River near the hamlet of Gardiner and the hamlet of Ardonia, modern US44 was also roughly located along another early <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> known as the Farmer's Turnpike. The Farmer's Turnpike continued east past Ardonia {{to the village of}} Milton where a ferry across the Hudson River once existed.|$|E

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of the highways in Texas are its frontage roads; most freeways have continuous frontage roads, one-way in urban areas and two-way in rural areas. Several <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> have one-way frontage roads—not necessarily continuous—with state highway numbers. Most <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are marked with special logos, but TxDOT has adopted a new marker as of 2006 for numbered <b>toll</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SR 125 from Otay Mesa Road to SR 54 near Chula Vista is a <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> called the South Bay Expressway. This portion {{was completed in}} 2007 {{after many years of}} planning and litigation related to concerns over the destruction of endangered species habitat. The <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> was operated by a public-private partnership known as South Bay Expressway LLC. However, the partnership declared bankruptcy in 2010 and sold the road to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in 2011. Since then, following a decrease in the toll amount, traffic using the highway has increased.|$|E
5|$|Efforts were {{underway}} in 1997 to secure {{federal funding for}} the highway and other infrastructure near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Bob Filner, and Representative Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a <b>toll</b> <b>road,</b> and SR905 would compete with the <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E
5|$|Milton and Houston Mann {{opened a}} <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> to Yosemite Valley in 1856, up the South Fork of the Merced River. They charged the then {{considerable}} sum of two dollars per person until {{the road was}} bought by Mariposa County, after which it became free.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately [...] of <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are {{included}} in the Interstate Highway System. While federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls on Interstates, many of the <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> on the system were either completed or under construction when the Interstate Highway System was established. Since these highways provided logical connections {{to other parts of the}} system, they were designated as Interstate highways. Congress also decided that it was too costly to either build toll-free Interstates parallel to these <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> or directly repay all the bondholders who financed these facilities and remove the tolls. Thus, these <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> were grandfathered into the Interstate Highway System.|$|R
50|$|All {{motorways}} and few expressways are <b>toll</b> <b>roads.</b> First such motorway M2 {{was opened}} to public in 1997. Since then the M3, M9, M10, and M1, all <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> have become operational. The M8 is under construction.|$|R
50|$|As the Interstate Highway System {{approached}} completion {{during the}} 1980s, states began constructing <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> again to provide new controlled-access highways {{which were not}} part of the original interstate system funding. Houston's outer beltway of interconnected <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> began in 1983, and many states followed {{over the last two decades}} of the 20th century adding new <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> including the tollway system around Orlando, Florida, Colorado's E-470, and Georgia State Route 400.|$|R
5|$|SR 37 is {{also known}} as Randy Bolt Memorial Highway from SR 29 to Skaggs Road (honoring a California Department of Justice agent who was killed {{in the line of duty}} in an {{accident}} along SR 37), and Sears Point <b>Toll</b> <b>Road,</b> which was originally a <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> that ran from SR 121 to Vallejo. SR 37 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 37 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Bolton to Leigh {{road was}} turnpiked in about 1770 and a toll gate was {{installed}} on the Atherton boundary on Bolton Road. Shakerley Lane <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> emerged near Green Hall on Bolton Road, and was built to get coal from the Shakerley pits to the turnpike road.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the onset}} of winter, the Barlow, Rector, and Palmer parties were forced to leave their wagons on the mountain's eastern foothills. Palmer left on horseback for Oregon City, while Barlow and Rector blazed a trail to Oregon City on foot.

5000|$|Most Spanish <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are networked, so {{you must}} get a ticket on {{entering}} and pay when leaving the road. Technically, all roads belong to the Government, although <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are built and maintained by private companies under a State concession; when the concession expires, the road is reverted to State ownership, however most of then are renewed. <b>Toll</b> <b>roads</b> are called in Spanish autopistas.

5000|$|The <b>Toll</b> <b>Roads</b> and Highways {{proposition}} is a legislatively referred {{constitutional amendment}} that would cause state <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> and highways leased to private entities to become toll-free within 35 years. The provision was permitted to be suspended by a two-thirds vote of the legislature. Supporters urged passage to make <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> free once they were turned over to state control; opponents were concerned that taxes could be raised to cover up to 35 years of deferred highway maintenance.|$|R
50|$|New Jersey has a 356 mi {{system of}} <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> {{maintained}} by state agencies. Aside from {{portions of the}} New Jersey Turnpike designated as I-95 and I-78, none of the <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are Interstate Highways due to the restriction of tolled facilities or commercial establishments in the Interstate Highway System. New Jersey's <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, and Atlantic City Expressway. The New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway are maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the Atlantic City Expressway is maintained by the South Jersey Transportation Authority. All <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> have service areas, at which food, gas, and other commercial services are provided. In addition, New Jersey <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> are assigned internal numbers by NJDOT—the New Jersey Turnpike is 700 (south of the split with I-95), the Garden State Parkway is 444, the Palisades Interstate Parkway (not tolled, but maintained by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission) is 445, and the Atlantic City Expressway is 446.|$|R
5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, {{wanted to have a}} strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 made it hard to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the SR 125 <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> {{started in}} September 2003; it was {{projected}} {{to open in}} 2006. Over the next few years, 1.5 million cubic meters of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions {{to allow for the}} interchange with SR 54 to be built. In 2005, the road was given the South Bay Expressway name. The South Bay Expressway extended SR 125 southward from SR 54 to Otay Mesa. This <b>toll</b> <b>road</b> was one of four privately financed toll highway projects, including the 91 Express Toll Lanes, that were approved in 1990; it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by both public and private sources, although the 91 Express Lanes, the other road, soon became entirely publicly owned. A partnership known as the South Bay Expressway operated the road, while an Australian company, Maquarie Group Ltd., handled financial and construction matters.|$|E
5|$|Environmental impact studies {{began on}} the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans {{proposed}} building the southern portion as a <b>toll</b> <b>road,</b> operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to build more than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, while the company hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow for the company to collect a settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed <b>toll</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a transport system with two road links in a series that describes traffic patterns under various pricing regimes. We consider various mixes of road operation including private-public <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> free-private <b>toll</b> <b>roads,</b> and free- public <b>toll</b> <b>roads.</b> We derive the pricing rules and evaluate the economic welfare under alternative regimes. Inter-regional distribution of welfare is also discussed. It is shown that pricing rules applied by a public operator differ from those in a parallel network, and the relative efficiency of alternative regimes depends on the presence of road congestion. A mix of private and public <b>toll</b> <b>roads</b> attains higher economic welfare and lower disparity, especially in the presence of heavy congestion. © 2008 LSE and the University of Bath...|$|R
