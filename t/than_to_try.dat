25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, {{it is more important to}} place pieces in versatile locations rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to form mills immediately and make the mistake of concentrating one's pieces in one area of the board. An ideal position, which typically results in a win, allows a player to shuttle one piece back and forth between two mills, removing a piece every turn.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{continuing}} the Amiens battle {{past the point}} of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E

25|$|Since a batsman {{is free to}} {{play any}} shot to any type of {{delivery}} as he wishes, the above list {{is by no means}} a complete list of the strokes that batsmen choose to play. Many unorthodox, typically high-risk, shots have been used throughout the history of the game. The advent of limited overs cricket has seen the increased use of unorthodox shots to hit the ball into gaps where there are no fielders placed. Unorthodox shots are rarely used in first-class cricket as the pace of the game is slower and it is relatively more important to keep one's wicket <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to score runs off every ball.|$|E
25|$|Japanese forces {{launched}} a small counter-attack in approximately platoon strength, with air support, {{shortly after the}} Sikhs had occupied the roadblock, but were quickly repelled. This was the limit of the Japanese response. It later transpired that General Iida, the Japanese commander, had anticipated that the British would stand and fight in Rangoon, and so had ordered the 33rd Division, the force moving against the city, to push forwards with speed rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and surround the city. As a result, a strong roadblock had been laid at Taukkyan, but only {{with the intention of}} protecting the division's flanks; once it had passed through and was marching on Rangoon, the garrison was withdrawn.|$|E

Prior to being assigned to Tuskegee, he had not been actively involved with any of the black Americans' causes. Parrish had as a youth, however, hiked three miles to see where a black man had been lynched. He later recalled that when people heard of the project to train black pilots and mechanics, he often heard [...] "weird and worried kind of laughter" [...] from white people and that a visiting British flying ace once stated that it was better to have a [...] "Messerschmitt on his tail <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to teach a Negro to fly".|$|E

500|$|It took Bonaparte (5 {{kilometers}} away from Marengo) until about 10 am {{to recognize that}} the Austrian activity was not a diversionary attack to cover the anticipated retreat by Melas. [...] His subordinates had brought their troops up in support of Victor's corps. Lannes's corps had deployed on the crucial right flank. GM Friedrich Joseph Anton von Bellegarde’s part of Kaim’s division had crossed the Fontanone north of Marengo and occupied La Barbotta farm. Lannes directed Watrin’s infantry to drive Bellegarde back. They briefly crossed the Fontanone before Austrian reserve guns drove the French back. Kellermann's heavy cavalry brigade and the 8th Dragoons took up a covering position on the left, smashing an attempt by GM Giovanni Pilatti's light dragoon brigade which attempted to cross the steep-sided Fontanone at its southern end to envelop Victor's flank. On the right, GdB Pierre Champeaux was killed trying to stop the progress of Ott's column. A small part of the 6ème Légère (6th Light Infantry Regiment) occupied Castel Ceriolo to the north, but soon Ott's lead units took it around 11:30 am and began putting pressure on the French right flank. Ott could not see any sign of the expected main French advance from Sale (to the northeast), so he sent GM Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim’s reinforced advance guard to outflank Lannes north of Marengo. By 11 am Bonaparte was on the battlefield. He sent urgent recalls to his recently detached forces and summoned up his last reserves. As they came up, GdD Jean-Charles Monnier's division and the Consular Guard were committed to extend and shore up the French right, rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to hold Marengo where Victor's men were running short of ammunition.|$|E

[...] KTVU later filed requests through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove user-uploaded videos of the prank available online, causing some criticism for [...] "trying to cover up their mistake"; KTVU/KICU {{vice president and general manager}} Tom Raponi contended that the takedown claims were not so much a way of preventing copyright infringement (as the uploads of the segment may fall under fair use criteria) <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to lessen insensitivity towards the Asian community.|$|E
2500|$|Poland's 200-mile-long {{front was}} manned {{by a thin}} line of 120,000 troops of the 1st and 4th Armies and Group Polesie. Logistics were a problem, and the force had {{inadequate}} support of only 460 artillery pieces. Gen. Szeptycki, commander of the Polish Northeast Front, had no strategic reserves, and some forces have been shuffled south to stop the Soviet offensive in Ukraine and Galicia. This approach to holding ground harked back to Great War practice of [...] "establishing a fortified line of defense." [...] Where it was a viable strategy on the Western Front, where each inch was saturated with troops, machine guns and artillery, the spacious fields of the Eastern Front would require a much larger force then those fielded by the Allies and the Central Powers in the West. Piłsudski tried to formulate a newe strategy of [...] "strategie de plein air" [...] (French: a [...] "strategy of open space") rather <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to tie his insufficient forces to mostly inexistant fixed positions, but his suggestions were not met with approval of other commanding officers. Meanwhile, the Red Army's Northwest Front was commanded by the young General Mikhail Tukhachevski. Tukhachevski forces of 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns were divided into one cavalry corps and four armies: the 3rd cavalry and 4th, 15th, 3rd and 16th armies, deployed respectively from north to south. With {{the advantage of being}} able to plan their offensive, crucially, the Russians were able to achieve a four-to-one force advantage in the planned break-through points.|$|E
