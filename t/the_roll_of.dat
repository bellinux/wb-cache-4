5|$|<b>The</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> honour was not {{completed}} as quickly. After {{a series of}} budget reductions, it was delivered in June 1929 but was of poor quality, {{and in the meantime}} the trustees of the castle museum had decided that the castle was not an appropriate place for the roll to be kept. It had also exceeded the reduced budget of £500, though Lutyens waived his fee and offered to pay the difference. The trustees changed their minds after improvements were made to the quality, and <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> honour was installed in the castle on 13 January 1931 without ceremony as a result of embarrassment over the delay.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{sentence}} meted {{to him was}} eventually reduced, the corruption case had left permanent damage on Knight's career as a civil servant. After investigations on him began in March 1991, he faced disciplinary hearings and his services were terminated on 26 March 1992. The President also revoked the prestigious Public Administration Medal, Gold, that had been awarded to Knight. In August 1994, the High Court struck Knight off <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> advocates and solicitors, meaning that {{he could no longer}} practise law. After being disbarred, Knight worked as a consultant in a public-listed company.|$|E
5|$|Erected as a {{permanent}} memorial to the men of Oldham {{who were killed in}} the First World War, Oldham's war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the trenches in order to go into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the trenches, is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.|$|E
5|$|German {{casualty}} {{figures are}} less complete {{than those of}} the Allies, and official figures have never been released. A signal possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September listed 3,300 casualties (1,300 killed and 2,000 injured) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek. Robert Kershaw's assessment of the incomplete records identified at least 2,500 casualties. In <b>the</b> <b>Roll</b> <b>of</b> Honour: Battle of Arnhem 17–26 September 1944, J.A. Hey of the Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum, Oosterbeek identified 1,725 German dead from the Arnhem area relating to the time of the battle. All of these figures are significantly higher than Model's conservative estimate of 3,300 casualties for the entire Market Garden area of battle (which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen).|$|E

The two were married on 6April1922, and had three daughters, Mary Cecile (Molly), born in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy), born in 1926, and Margaret Lyle, born in 1933. Herring worked as a barrister, and lectured in law at the University of Melbourne. He became a King's Counsel on 25February1936. Mary worked as a physician at antenatal clinics.|$|E

5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers {{killed in the}} line of duty, regarding the high cost, and that <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or as a result of criminal acts, rather than all officers killed {{in the line of}} duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest single}} {{memorial}} of the 20th century {{is the war}} memorial, {{to the design of}} Hardy Wilson, dedicated on 14 June 1922. It commemorates more than 50 men associated with St James' who were killed in the First World War, throughout which <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> honour was regularly read during the Eucharist. In 2014, St James' was part of a series of commemorations of the bicentenary of the death of the colony's first Governor, Arthur Phillip. On 31 August, a memorial plaque, similar in form to one placed in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 9 July, was unveiled by the 37th Governor, Marie Bashir.|$|E
5|$|The main Crompton War Memorial, {{located on}} the High Street, {{consists}} of a Scottish granite plinth surmounted by a large bronze statue flanked by two Rolls of Honour containing the 346names of those from Shaw and Crompton who fought and died in World War I. Panels listing <b>the</b> <b>Roll</b> <b>of</b> Honour from World War II were added and unveiled on 12 November 1950 by Councillor H. M. Turner. Commissioned by the Crompton War Memorial Committee, the statue was conceptualised in 1919 by Richard Reginald Goulden, and unveiled on 29 April 1923 by General Sir Ian Hamilton. The original cost for the memorial alone was £4,000, but the total cost, including site and layout, was about £6,067.|$|E

5|$|Although they {{recorded}} {{all income}} {{that came through}} the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, {{as well as more}} occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} Pipe roll from 1130 records {{an income}} of £24,500. This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record {{in the early years}} of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> 1130.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Roll bending is {{a useful}} {{technology}} for manufacturing {{a wide variety of}} products in small quantities.
