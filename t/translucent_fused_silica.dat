30|$|The {{effects of}} the {{nanostructure}} on <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> substrates, which have a lower defect density than the two other glass substrates and variable strength enhancement under identical test conditions, were further analyzed using Weibull analyses. Randomly distributed surface and subsurface defects cause undesirable variation in the bending strength. Under the same bending conditions, the Weibull modulus (m) defines a statistical variation based on the probability of failure, where a larger variation causes a lower m. A larger m value is indicative of a more predictable failure behavior, which is required for reliability considerations. This modulus was 8.2, 7.8, and 6.8 for plain <b>fused</b> <b>silica,</b> aluminosilicate, and borosilicate glasses, respectively. This result confirms the unpredictable behavior of borosilicate glass, which was caused by random defects and {{a larger number of}} random stress concentration points than in the aluminosilicate and <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> substrates (Fig.  5 a). The fabrication of 750 -nm-deep nanostructured <b>fused</b> <b>silica,</b> aluminosilicate, and borosilicate glass substrates increased the Weibull modulus to 10.9, 10.7, and 11, respectively (Fig.  5 b). After artificial defect formation, the estimated Weibull modulus was 8.2, 11.5, and 16.3 for plain <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> and <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> with 500  nm and 4 -μm-deep artificial square notches, respectively. <b>Fused</b> <b>silica</b> exhibited a higher m value {{in the presence of a}} deeper square notch, demonstrating the dominance of this square notch over all of the other defects. Moreover, the corresponding Weibull modulus of the plain <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> increased from 8.2 to 11.3 upon fabrication of the 4 -μm-deep nanostructures. This result confirms the reliability of the nanostructure strengthening process for all three studied glass substrates.|$|R

30|$|Defects and {{heterogeneities}} {{degrade the}} strength of glass with different surface and subsurface properties. This study uses surface nanostructures to improve the bending strength of glass and investigates the effect of defects on three glass types. Borosilicate and aluminosilicate glasses with a higher defect density than <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> exhibited 118 and 48  % improvement, respectively, in bending strength after surface nanostructure fabrication. <b>Fused</b> <b>silica,</b> exhibited limited strength improvement. Therefore, a 4 -μm-deep square notch was fabricated to study {{the effect of a}} dominant defect in low defect density glass. The reduced bending strength of <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> caused by artificial defect increased 65  % in the presence of 2 -μm-deep nanostructures, and the <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> regained its original strength when the nanostructures were 4  μm deep. In fragmentation tests, the <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> specimen broke into two major portions because of the creation of artificial defects. The number of fragments increased when nanostructures were fabricated on the <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> surface. Bending strength improvement and fragmentation test confirm the usability of this method for glasses with low defect densities when a dominant defect is present on the surface. Our findings indicate that nanostructure-based strengthening is suitable for all types of glasses irrespective of defect density, and the observed Weibull modulus enhancement confirms the reliability of this method.|$|R

To enable this capability, this work investigates the use of <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> as a substrate for piezoelectrically actuated resonators for applications in timing references. This thesis presents the design and fabrication of a piezoelectrically actuated <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> resonator. The fabricated resonators show a quality factor (Q) of 19, 671 at 4. 96 MHz with an insertion loss of 16. 9 dB, and is the first reported example of a piezoelectrically actuated <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> resonator in literature. An in-depth investigation into loss mechanisms in <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> is performed in order to identify and address the major losses in the device and maximize potential performance. Multiple experimental and analytical investigations are presented, with a new form of loss, known as charge redistribution, presented as a possible dominant loss in these piezoelectric resonators. This loss mechanism is analytically modeled and simulated to have a Q of 25, 100, within 20 % of the experimentally measured devices. The temperature sensitivity of <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> is also addressed; as <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> shows a temperature coefficient of elasticity almost three times higher than that shown in uncompensated silicon. Both active and passive methods of temperature compensation are implemented, including a <b>fused</b> <b>silica</b> ovenized platform and nickel-refilled trenches for temperature compensation.

From this, a dual-mode system is proposed for use in ovenized systems where two modes are simultaneously activated in a single device volume. In this system, one mode acts as a stable reference frequency and the second mode acts as a temperature sensor, allowing for extremely accurate ovenization.
