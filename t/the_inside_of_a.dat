5|$|A {{scene in}} the pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed during the same block as episodes three and four, which were directed by Sam Miller. The rest of the finale was filmed several weeks later. <b>The</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surveillance van used in a few scenes were shot at a set {{right next to the}} Grid set; using a set would be more manageable for the filming crew. A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; the Home Office and Lindemann's office. Other scenes at the Home Office were filmed in a separate building in Roehampton.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Frazier Park, California, with a budget of $45,000. It began in September 2008 and lasted 20 days, {{most of which were}} spent on Ron Trost's property. Scenes set in BLT's house were filmed at the Trosts' childhood home, while the look of his basement was designed using <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shipping container. Many set pieces were taken either from items Ron had collected or from other film sets. The Trost brothers split directorial duties between themselves; Brandon focused on visuals and Jason focused on the performances and story. Valmassy directed a driving scene featuring himself and Folley when the Trosts were briefly unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> curve at speed could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E

5|$|The {{identities of}} several of the men were {{obscured}} in some fashion, either in shadow or, in one instance, behind a large potted palm tree. Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position that homosexuality is a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of homosexuality as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a street corner and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E
5|$|The quadrangular castle {{design that}} emerged in France during the 13th century was another {{development}} that removed {{the need for a}} keep. Castles had needed additional living space since their first emergence in the 9th century; initially this had been provided by halls in the bailey, then later by ranges of chambers alongside <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bailey wall, such as at Goodrich. But French designs in the late 12th century took the layout of a contemporary unfortified manor house, whose rooms faced around a central, rectangular courtyard, and built a wall around them to form a castle. The result, illustrated initially at Yonne, and later at Château de Farcheville, was a characteristic quadrangular layout with four large, circular corner towers. It lacked a keep, which was not needed to support this design.|$|E
5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> turn. Roberts tried the technique {{and found that it}} helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the coconut}} crab is, like that of all decapods, divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws), with the left being larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, {{powerful}} walking legs with pointed tips, which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end, allowing young coconut crabs to grip <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in color between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.|$|E
5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. As the camera moves across the map, focusing on {{the locations of the}} episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.|$|E

5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne {{take place in}} a {{separate}} continuity {{to the rest of the}} Megami Tensei series. Nocturne is set in modern-day Tokyo before and after an event called the Conception, in which the normal world is destroyed through the actions of a cult to prevent the world's stagnation and ultimate demise, as dictated by the Great Will governing existence. Tokyo is transformed into a wasteland on <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sphere inhabited by the spirits of humans who died in the Conception; demons who wage war with each other; and Reasons, deity-like beings formed from the gathering of Magatsuhi by people with a deity or demon sponsor. Those who possess Reasons seek to remake the world in their image by presenting themselves to Kagutsuchi, a semi-sentient manifestation of the Great Will's power which exists to perpetuate the destruction and rebirth of worlds through Conception, and proving their worth. Another realm mentioned in the story is the Shadow Vortex, a limbo where dead worlds and the beings who created them linger.|$|E
