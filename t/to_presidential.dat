5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation <b>to</b> <b>presidential</b> debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E
5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced <b>to</b> <b>presidential</b> pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes <b>to</b> <b>presidential</b> electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the 1997 film, Air Force One, 24 {{featured}} the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One). Air Force One {{was featured in}} 24 seasons 2 and 4.

Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air Force One. The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy {{in the office of}} the Vice President and responding <b>to</b> <b>Presidential</b> disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air Force One set from another television series, The West Wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{inauguration of}} Barack Obama as the 44th President {{took place on}} January 20, 2009.

He ordered {{the closing of the}} Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries. Obama reduced the secrecy given <b>to</b> <b>presidential</b> records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's {{assassination}} {{had taken}} place roughly sixteen years before in the closing stages of the Civil War. On the other hand, Garfield's term was marked (for the most part) by peacetime, and a general complacency with respect <b>to</b> <b>presidential</b> security had developed by this time.

25|$|On 25 October 2016, Park {{publicly}} acknowledged {{her close}} ties with Choi. On 28 October, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff while her approval ratings fell to 4%.

It was the worst ever approval rate in Korean history and is worse than the 6% approval rating of former President Kim Young-sam, who was widely blamed for forcing the Korean economy into the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The controversy led to mass protests and rallies in October and November 2016 calling for her resignation.
