5|$|Patton's final {{assignment}} was to command <b>the</b> <b>Fifteenth</b> United States Army, based in Bad Nauheim. <b>The</b> <b>Fifteenth</b> Army {{at this point}} consisted only of a small headquarters staff tasked to compile {{a history of the}} war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest in the duty. He began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun, as well as Stockholm, where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided he would leave his post at <b>the</b> <b>Fifteenth</b> Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for Christmas leave. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century.

New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E
