25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{global trade}} regulations and LDCs have gained {{a lot of}} media and policy attention thanks to the recently collapsed Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations being termed a development round. During the WTO's Hong Kong Ministerial, it was agreed that LDCs could see 100 percent duty-free, quota-free access to U.S. markets if the round were completed. But analysis of the deal by NGOs found that the text of the proposed LDC deal had substantial loopholes that might make the offer less than <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>100</b> percent access, and could even erase some current duty-free access of LDCs to rich country markets. Dissatisfaction with these loopholes led some economists to call for a reworking of the Hong Kong deal.|$|E

40|$|Based on the nano-polysilicon {{thin film}} {{transistors}} (TFTs), a high-sensitivity pressure sensor {{was designed and}} fabricated in this paper. The pressure sensing element is composed of a Wheatstone bridge with four nano-polysilicon TFTs designed on different positions of the square silicon diaphragm.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reliability of visual assessments of SLB severity by raters (i. e. one plant pathologist with extensive experience and three other raters trained prior to field observations using standard area diagrams and DISTRAIN) was determined by comparison with assumed actual values obtained by digital image analysis. Initially analyses were performed using SLB severity over <b>the</b> <b>full</b> 0 - <b>100</b> % range; then, to explore error over short ranges of the 0 - 100 % scale, the scale was divided into sequential 10 %-increments based on the actual values. Linâs concordance correlation (LCC) analysis demonstrated that all raters were accurate when compared over the whole severity range (LCC coefficient (Ïc) = 0. 92 - 0. 99). However, agreement between actual and visual SLB severities was less good when compared over the short intervals of the 10 Ã 10 % classes (Ïc= - 0. 12 - 0. 99), demonstrating that agreement will {{vary depending on the}} actual disease range over which it is compared.

During the study period (January- 2014 through December- 2015), all consecutive patients in our tertiary university hospital scheduled by a urologist for CTU to exclude UUT malignancy were invited to participate. Diagnostic performance and visualization scores of 3. 0 T-MRU were compared to CTU using Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Twenty patients (39 UUT excreting units) were evaluated. 3. 0 T-MRU and CTU achieved equal diagnostic performances. The benign etiology of seven UUT obstructions was clarified equally with both methods. Another two urinary tract malignant tumors and one benign extraurinary tumor were detected and confirmed.
