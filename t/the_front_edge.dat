5|$|Termites are {{relatively}} poor fliers and are readily blown downwind in wind speeds {{of less than}} 2km/h, shedding their wings soon after landing at an acceptable site, where they mate and attempt to form a nest in damp timber or earth. Wings of most termites have three heavy veins along the basal part of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the forewing and the crossveins near the wing tip are angled, making trapezoidal cells. Although subterranean termite wings have just two major veins along <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the forewing and the cross veins towards the wingtip are perpendicular to these veins, making square and rectangular cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading {{can be used to}} virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|Collector Heinrich Fischer had {{originally}} labeled a partial foot, from the Solnhofen area, {{as belonging to}} Compsognathus longipes. Though this identification was rejected by Wilhelm Barnim Dames in 1884, Friedrich von Huene nevertheless in 1925 provisionally referred the specimen to Compsognathus. However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus. These were not identical to those of C. longipes, having serrations on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> but were because of general similarities in form referred to a Compsognathus sp.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is {{about as long as}} the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Lapels are {{the folded}} flaps of cloth on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of a jacket or coat, and are most {{commonly}} found on formal clothing and suit jackets. Usually they are formed by folding over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> jacket or coat and sewing {{them to the}} collar, an extra piece of fabric {{around the back of}} the neck.|$|R

5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, {{more than a quarter of}} the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E

25|$|In {{the pelvis}} {{there was a}} little notch in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the ilium. The {{relatively}} long shaft of the ischium curved downwards. The hindlimb was elongated, largely because of a long lower leg, having 90% of the length of the thighbone. The foot was also long, especially in the metatarsus.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 study {{established}} eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies {{in which}} Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the frontal bone make contact, the depression {{in which the}} supratemporal fenestra, a skull roof opening, was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion {{of the first and}} second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger. The notch in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the ilium is directed to the front and only weakly developed. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the ischium shaft has a long obturator process with a rectangular end.|$|E
25|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the pubic shafts and {{the back}} of the {{intestines}} a large empty space is present. Also, the rectum seems to run in a very high position as if it were forced upwards by something. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco, in life this space would have been filled by the yolk sac of the hatchling; on hatching the juveniles of reptiles typically have not absorbed all the yolk and use the residual nutrients to supplement the food intake during their first weeks.|$|E
500|$|Whittington {{interpreted}} as gills some markings {{on the upper}} surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side, and thought that these gills were flat underneath, had overlapping layers on top, and attached to the bases of the lobes.

He also found marks inside <b>the</b> lobes' <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> that he {{interpreted as}} internal channels connecting the gills to {{the interior of the}} body, much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel. On the other hand, Bergström (1986) interpreted both the [...] "gills" [...] and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body.|$|R

25|$|Marimba bars {{produce their}} fullest sound when struck just off center, while {{striking}} {{the bar in}} the center produces a more articulate tone. On chromatic marimbas, the accidentals (black keys) can also be played on the space between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the bar and its node (the place where the string goes through the bar) if necessary.

25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} and hollow, {{are the first}} two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical colubrids (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|E
25|$|At the Divine Liturgy, {{during the}} Liturgy of Preparation, when the Aër {{is to be}} placed over the Gifts (the Bread and Wine for the Eucharist), it is first wrapped around the censer and then laid over the Chalice and Diskos, so that <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the Aër just touches {{the surface of the}} table. When not {{covering}} the Gifts, the Aër is folded (usually folded 3 x 3, so that when it is laid out flat the creases will form a cross). The Aër normally has a cross embroidered in its exact center, so that when it is folded the cross is visible.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> dorsal fins and the {{pectoral}} fins are hardened into stiff spines.

25|$|The speaker {{mounting}} scheme (including cabinets) {{can also}} cause diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, {{or some combination of}} these and other schemes.|$|R

25|$|Just {{before the}} {{chanting}} of the Symbol of the Faith (Nicene Creed), the Priest will kiss the Diskos and Chalice (by kissing the Aër {{in the place}} where it touches each vessel) and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the Holy Table. During the Creed, the priest will hold the Aër above the Gifts and waive it slowly, indicating the activity of the Holy Spirit. When a bishop is serving the Liturgy, the concelebrating priests will hold the Aër during the Creed as the bishop kneels (or bows his head) underneath it. After the Creed, the Aër is folded and placed on the Holy Table. In some practices, the priest will turn and bless the people with the Aër during the Sursum corda.|$|E
25|$|These {{buildings}} were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences {{depending on the}} region {{in which they were}} constructed. The scaenae frons was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The proscaenium was a wall that supported <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the proscaenium. The Roman theatre also had a podium, which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The scaenae was originally not part of the building itself, constructed only to provide sufficient background for the actors. Eventually, it became a part of the edifice itself, made out of concrete. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (orchestra) and the seating section (auditorium). Vomitoria or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
