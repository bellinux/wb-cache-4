5|$|At least 25 laureates have {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> <b>Prize</b> for {{contributions in the}} field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry. Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> <b>prize</b> twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> <b>Prize</b> in physics in 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals, including four women: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009).
