50|$|HAVS is a {{widespread}} recognized industrial disease affecting {{tens of thousands of}} workers. It is a disorder that affects the blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and joints, of the hand, wrist, and arm. Its best known effect is vibration-induced white finger (VWF), a term introduced by the Industrial Injury Advisory Council in 1970. Injury can occur at frequencies between 5 and 2000Hz but the greatest risk for fingers is between 50 and 300Hz. The <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> for hand and arm is calculated by the use of ISO 5349-1, this stipulate a max damage between 8-16Hz and a rapidly declining risk at higher frequencies. The ISO 5349-1 frequency risk assessment does not match the estimated risks for vibration-induced white finger well.|$|E

Financial risk and share price behavior has been investigated in this dissertation. For this purpose monthly data from 2003 to 2012 and annual data for period of 2003 to 2012 has been used. The stock return data of 115 companies has been used as dependent variable where as exchange rare interest rate financial <b>exposure</b> firm size <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> growth rate and profitability has been used as independent variable. This study employs multivariate regression analysis. This study is focused on financial risk and it impact on firm through different dimensions first on industry level then on firm level and lastly analysis for exporting and non-exporting firms has been done. The industry level analysis shows that statistically significant negative relationship exists between exchange rate interest rate and stock return. The relationship of <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> foreign <b>exposure</b> firm size and growth rate is found insignificant with industry returns. The firm level analysis is done from different dimensions. The interest rate is negatively related to monthly returns of the firm and this relationship is found significant. The relationship of <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> foreign <b>exposure</b> firm size and growth rate is found insignificant with firm level stock returns. For exporting and non-exporting firms the study shows positive relationship between interest rate and firm stock returns and this relation is stronger in exporting firms as compare to other firms operating in same industry.

Expressing development considerations in terms of risk exposures over an independent variable (e. g. time, cumulative effort, etc.) enables the quantitative assessment of typically qualitative attributes.

40|$|Hedging {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} topics in finance. How to effectively hedge the exposed risk draws significant interest from both academicians and practitioners. In a complete financial market, every contingent claim can be hedged perfectly. In an incomplete market, the investor can eliminate his risk exposure by superhedging. However, both perfect hedging and superhedging usually call for a high cost. In some situations, the investor does not have enough capital or is not willing to spend that much to achieve a zero risk position. This brings us to the topic of partial hedging. In this thesis, we establish the risk measure based partial hedging model and study the optimal partial hedging strategies under various criteria. First, we consider two of the most common risk measures known as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We derive the analytical forms of optimal partial hedging strategies under the criterion of minimizing VaR of the investor's <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> The knock-out call hedging strategy and the bull call spread hedging strategy are shown to be optimal among two admissible sets of hedging strategies. Since VaR risk measure has some undesired properties, we consider the CVaR risk measure and show that bull call spread hedging strategy is optimal under the criterion of minimizing CVaR of the investor's <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> The comparison between our proposed partial hedging strategies and some other partial hedging strategies, including the well-known quantile hedging strategy, is provided and the advantages of our proposed partial hedging strategies are highlighted. Then we apply the similar approaches in the context of reinsurance. The VaR-based optimal reinsurance strategies are derived under various constraints. Then we study the optimal partial hedging strategies under general risk measures. We provide the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and use these conditions to study some specific hedging strategies. The robustness of our proposed CVaR-based optimal partial hedging strategy is also discussed in this part. Last but not least, we propose a new method, simulation-based approach, to formulate the optimal partial hedging models. By using the simulation-based approach, we can numerically obtain the optimal partial hedging strategy under various constraints and criteria. The numerical results in the examples in this part coincide with the theoretical results...|$|E

We introduce the concept of <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> which integrates risk at the individual ship level with vessel traffic densities and location specific parameters such as weather and oceanographic conditions, geographical features or environmental sensitivities. A comprehensive and robust method to estimate and predict risk exposure can be beneficial to maritime administrations to enhance mitigation strategies and understand uncertainties. We further provide a proof of concept based on 53 million observations of vessel positions and individual risk profiles of 8, 900 individual ships.

We further identify and discuss uncertainties and present our ideas on how other risk layers could be integrated in the future...|$|E

Risk shifting might {{be caused by}} ill-motivated trades of unskilled or agency-prone fund managers who trade to increase their personal compensation.

This article investigates the performance consequences of risk shifting and sheds light on the mecha-nisms and the economic motivations behind risk-shifting behavior. Using a holdings-based measure of risk shifting, we find that funds that increase risk perform worse than funds that keep stable risk levels over time, suggesting that risk shifting either is an indication of inferior ability or is motivated by agency issues.

Results are based on data of aviation accidents in the years 1986 - 1992, obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration. The study found that females employed by major airlines had significantly higher accident rates than their male counterparts overall. However, female airline pilots, on average, were less experienced and much younger than males. Male pilot-error accidents were modeled using logistic regression, regressing on age, experience (<b>total</b> flying hours), <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> (flying hours in the last 6 months), and employer (major/non-major airline). The male model provided a good fit for female airline pilots as well as for males.

These findings suggest that neither males nor females are a safer pilot group. Airlines should make every effort to recruit and retain experienced females.

Subsequent {{to the introduction}} in Chapter one, the second chapter deals with extreme dependence between the CDS spreads of major European banks and shows that the propensity of a bank to experience extreme co-movements in its CDS premia together with the market is priced in the bank's default swap spread during the recent financial crisis.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{resource allocation}} algorithms for processing streams of events on computational grids. For example, financial trading applications are executed on large computational grids that receive streams of data such as stock ticker prices, commodity prices, foreign-exchange rates and <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> The economic {{value of a}} computation depends on the time taken to execute it; an arbitrage opportunity can disappear in seconds. Given limited resources, {{it is not possible}} to process all streams without delay. The more resource available to a computation, the less time it takes to process the input, and thus the more value it generates. Therefore, the scheduling policy should be designed to optimize the net economic value of computations executed on the grid. Computations on these streams often have substantial state; for example, a computation in a trading application maintains the state of the trade. Some operations on streams cannot be moved from one computer to another without also moving the state associated with the operations, so pinning operations to computers in a grid is an important step in the scheduling process. This turns the optimization problem into a non-convex integer programming problem, which is NP-complete. In this paper, we propose two scheduling/resource allocation algorithms for processing streams on computational grids to optimize economic value. Both algorithms are based on market mechanisms; one uses a centralized market and the other decentralized markets. We prove bounds on performance and present measurements to show that the performances of the resource allocation systems are near-optimal and outperform straightforward load-balancing heuristics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the task of}} forming a portfolio of assets that outperforms a benchmark index, while imposing a constraint on the tracking error volatility. We examine three alternative formulations of active portfolio management. The first one is a typical setup in which the fund manager myopically maximizes excess return. The second formulation {{is an attempt to}} set a limit on the <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of the portfolio by adding a constraint that forces a priori the risk of the portfolio to be equal to the benchmark's. In this paper, we also propose a third formulation that directly maximizes the efficiency of active portfolios, while setting a limit on the maximum tracking error variance. In determining optimal active portfolios, we incorporate additional constraints on the optimization problem, such as a limit on the maximum number of assets included in the portfolio (i. e. the cardinality of the portfolio) as well as upper and lower bounds on asset weights. From a computational point of view, the incorporation of these complex, though realistic, constraints becomes a challenge for traditional numerical optimization methods, especially when one has to assemble a portfolio from a big universe of assets. To deal properly with the complexity and the "roughness" of the solution space, we use particle swarm optimization, a population-based evolutionary technique. As an empirical application of the methodology, we select portfolios of different cardinality that actively reproduce the performance of the FTSE/ATHEX 20 Index of the Athens Stock Exchange. Our empirical study reveals important results concerning the efficiency of common practices in active portfolio management and the incorporation of cardinality constraints.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{volatility}} of defined benefit of pension plans over the period 1999 - 2006. We document economically significant relationships between the asset-liability structure and the risk-taking of pension plans. We find that increasing the underfunding of a bottom size-decile plan by one-standard deviation on average implies a 34 % increase in {{the volatility of}} the plan. In contrast, the relationship between funding status and risk is reversed for top size-decile plans. The higher risk-taking of underfunded plans is confined to higher upside-risk exposure, consistent with plans hedging pension liabilities via structured finance instruments with non-linear payoffs. Defined benefit (DB) 1 pension plans today seem less secure than a decade ago. The total amount of US retirement assets in private DB plans was $ 2. 328 trillion as of March 2007 (According to the Investment Company Institute). There {{is a growing concern}} about the funding status of DB pension plans as many of them are experiencing declining solvency. While regulators and policy makers are calling for reform of the institutional framework of DB pension plans, understanding the determinants of DB risk-taking is of critical importance. This paper investigates the relationship between the risk-taking of US DB pension plans and their asset-liability structure and characteristics. We report evidence that the <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of privately-held pension plans is explained by the interaction of the funding status of the pension plan and the plan size, while the risk-taking of publicly-held corporate plans is driven by their commitment to accrue future obligations. Moreover, we find evidence of asymmetric risk exposure of the average pension plan that is consistent with hedging of pension liabilities. These relationships between funding and risk can be interpreted as evidence of different managerial incentive structures across different plans. Theoretical arguments for optimal pension-plan risk-taking have produced conflicting predictions about both high and low risk (for example, Sharpe (1976), Treynor (1977), Blac...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the optimal {{reinsurance}} design problem {{and extend the}} classical model in three different directions: (1) In the first framework, we add the additional assumption that the reinsurer can default on its obligations. If the indemnity is beyond the reinsurer's payment ability, the reinsurer fails {{to pay for the}} exceeding part and this induces a default risk for the insurer. In our model, the reinsurer is assumed to measure the risk of an insured loss by Value-at-Risk regulation and prepares {{the same amount of money}} as the initial reserve. As soon as the indemnity is larger than this value plus the premium, default occurs. From the insurer's point of view, two optimization problems are going to be considered when the insurer: 1) maximizes his expectation of utility; 2) minimizes the VaR of his retained loss. (2) In the second framework, the reinsurance buyer (insurer) adopts a convex risk measure to control his total loss while the reinsurance seller (reinsurer) price the reinsurance contract by Wang's premium principle with a distortion. Without specifying a particular convex risk measure and distortion, we obtain a general expression for the optimal reinsurance contract that minimizes the insurer's <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> (3) In the third framework, we study optimal reinsurance designs from the perspectives of both an insurer and a reinsurer and take into account both an insurer's aims and a reinsurer's goals in reinsurance contract designs. We develop optimal reinsurance contracts that minimize the convex combination of the VaR risk measures of the insurer's loss and the reinsurer's loss under two types of constraints, respectively. The constraints describe the interest of both the insurer and the reinsurer. With the first type of constraints, the insurer and the reinsurer each have their limit on the VaR of their own loss. With the second type of constraints, the insurer has a limit on the VaR of his loss while the reinsurer has a target on his profit from selling a reinsurance contract. For both types of constraints, we derive the optimal reinsurance form for a wide class of reinsurance policies and under the expected value reinsurance premium principle...|$|E

Factor Implied <b>Risk</b> <b>Exposures</b> (FIRE) are obtained by breaking down a change in risk disclosure into a market volatility component and a bank-speci 8 ̆ 5 c <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> component. In a study of large US and international banks, we show that (1) changes in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are negatively correlated with market volatility and (2) changes in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are positively correlated across banks, {{which is consistent with}} banks exhibiting commonality in trading...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} issue in global corporate risk management {{is whether the}} multinationality of a firm matters {{in terms of its}} effect on exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> In this paper, we examine the exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of US firms during 1983 - 2006, comparing multinational and non-multinational firms and focusing on the role of operational hedging. Since MNCs and non-multinationals differ in size and other characteristics, we construct matched samples of MNCs and non-multinationals based on the propensity score method. We find that the multinationality in fact matters for a firm's exchange exposure but not in the way usually presumed - the exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are actually smaller and less significant for MNCs than non-multinationals. The results are robust with respect to different samples and model specifications. There is evidence that operational hedging decreases a firm's exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> and increases its stock returns. The effective deployment of operational risk management strategies provides one reason why MNCs may have insignificant exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> estimates.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a novel toll setting policy to {{regulate}} hazardous material (hazmat) transportation, where the regulator (e. g., a government authority) aims at minimizing {{not only the}} network <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> but also at spreading the risk in an equitable way over a given road network. The idea {{is to use a}} toll setting policy to discourage carriers transporting hazmat from overloading portions of the network with the consequent increase of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of the population involved. Specifically, we assume that the toll paid by a carrier on a network link depends on the usage of that link by all carriers. Therefore the route choices of each carrier depend on the other carrier’s choices, and the tolls deter the carriers from using links with a high <b>total</b> <b>risk.</b> The resulting model is a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) problem, where the inner problem is a Nash equilibrium problem (game) having as players the carriers, each one wishing to minimize his or her travel cost (including tolls); the outer problem is addressed by the government authority, whose aim is finding the link tolls that induce the carriers to choose route plans that minimize both the network <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> and the maximum link <b>total</b> <b>risk</b> among the network links (to address risk equity). To guarantee the stability of the solution, we study conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium, and propose a local search heuristic for the MPEC problem. Computational results are carried out on a real road network, comparing the performance of our toll setting policy with the toll setting approach proposed in the literature...|$|R
