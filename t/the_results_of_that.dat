25|$|The Copenhagen interpretation: Assuming wave {{functions}} are not real, wave-function collapse is interpreted subjectively. The moment one observer measures the spin of one particle, {{he knows the}} spin of the other.

25|$|Compression/expansion of time: SPs {{can provide}} a {{longitudinal}} experience and enable students to follow through patients over time, even in a compressed time frame of examination. One technique employed in SP encounters {{is the use of}} information cards.

25|$|During the WFM's {{first major}} strike in Cripple Creek {{just two years}} earlier, Colorado Governor Waite, a Populist, called out the Colorado National Guard to protect strikers. This action, and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> strike, {{encouraged}} working class support for Populists. However, the fear of union militancy, and particularly a negative reaction to the WFM's successful Cripple Creek strike, helped to sweep Populists from power. Subsequently, the hostility of both Democratic and Republican officials during the Leadville strike caused some workers to distrust both major parties.|$|E

25|$|The {{emphasis}} on speed and agility is a {{defining characteristic of}} taekwondo and has its origins in analyses undertaken by Choi Hong Hi. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> analysis are known by ITF practitioners as Choi's Theory of Power. Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and Newtonian physics as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed {{that the power of}} a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object. In other words, speed is more important than size in terms of generating power. This principle was incorporated into the early design of taekwondo and is still used.|$|E
25|$|The moon {{jellyfish}} {{were identified}} as Aurelia aurita by Hamner. However, since the release of that report in 1981, genetic testing {{has been done on}} specimens of Aurelia collected from locations throughout the world. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> testing indicate in addition to the three named species of Aurelia there are at least six other cryptic species in the Aurelia genus. Three of the cryptic species identified were from Palau. One of these cryptic species is common to four of Palau's marine lakes with jellyfish populations including Jellyfish Lake. Hence, the most accurate designation for the moon jellyfish in Jellyfish Lake (as of February 2001) is Aurelia sp. Despite the close proximity of Palau's moon jellyfish cryptic species, Dawson and Jacobs stated that the molecular data suggested that they had not interbred for millions of years.|$|E
25|$|The Constitutional Court {{began its}} {{hearings}} for approximately 620 election disputes on 18 May. Cases involved both elections for DPR and Regional Representative Council (DPD) candidates. A lawyer for a DPD candidate stated {{that all but}} two of the political parties accepted <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> election in the province of Papua. On 11 June, the Court ordered the General Election Commission to revise its calculations for allocating seats in the DPR on grounds that the Commission has misinterpreted its own regulations. Though the Commission initially refused to abide by the Court's ruling, it reversed its decision less than 24 hours later but would not begin work on the revision before 24 June. As many as 16 candidates who have been declared as victors in their respective districts could lose their seats, including DPR Speaker Agung Laksono.|$|E

500|$|In early 2002, Portland Aerial Transportation, Inc. (PATI) {{was formed}} as a {{non-profit}} board. One of its first public actions was to request the Portland Bureau of Transportation (at the time known as the Portland Office of Transportation, and abbreviated as PDOTsic) to undertake an independent analysis of the connectivity options considered earlier by the university and its development supporters. In May 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's process proposal and also accepted PATI as the project sponsor. PDOT's assessment led {{to the same conclusion}} OHSU had reached earlier: an aerial tram was the preferred approach. PDOT also recommended a second tram linking the Marquam Hill area with a nearby transit center on SW Barbur Boulevard. [...] In July 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's recommendations and asked PDOT and PATI to proceed to the design phase, including a design competition. Both were also asked to work with residents of the affected neighborhoods to identify ways to mitigate the tram's impact and identify other desired neighborhood improvements which should accompany the project. One of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> process was the Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, which was completed mid-2012.|$|E
