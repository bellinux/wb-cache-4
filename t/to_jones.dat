5|$|Moses {{announced}} {{during the}} opening of the Bethpage State Parkway in November 1936 that the land for extending the Meadowbrook from the Southern State Parkway to the Northern State Parkway had been acquired by Nassau County and plans for the road were being designed by the State Division of Highways. Moses stated that the funds would be requested at the next session of the New York State Legislature, with a completion date of 1939 to coincide with {{the opening of the}} 1939 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens. This would make it plausible for motorists to go from Flushing <b>to</b> <b>Jones</b> Beach State Park directly. The new extension would also alleviate congestion along several north–south highways in Nassau County and provide quicker access <b>to</b> <b>Jones</b> Beach. However, construction on the $10million (1956USD) highway was delayed until December 1953.|$|E
