5000|$|Single-event upsets (SEU) or <b>transient</b> <b>radiation</b> {{effects in}} {{electronics}} are state changes of memory or register bits {{caused by a}} single ion interacting with the chip. They do not cause lasting damage to the device, but may cause lasting problems to a system which cannot recover from such an error. Soft error, reversible. In very sensitive devices, a single ion can cause a multiple-bit upset (MBU) in several adjacent memory cells. SEUs can become Single-event functional interrupts (SEFI) when they upset control circuits, such as state machines, placing the device into an undefined state, a test mode, or a halt, which would then need a reset or a power cycle to recover.|$|E

This paper proposes the <b>transient</b> <b>radiation</b> SPICE models of NMOS, PMOS, and INVERTER {{based on the}} <b>transient</b> <b>radiation</b> analysis using TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design). To make the SPICE model of a CMOS circuit, the photocurrent in the PN junction of NMOS and PMOS was replaced as current source, and a latch-up phenomenon in the inverter was applied using a parasitic thyristor. As an example, the proposed <b>transient</b> <b>radiation</b> SPICE model was applied to a CMOS NAND circuit. The CMOS NAND circuit was simulated by SPICE and TCAD using the 0. 18 um CMOS process model parameter.

40|$|Advantages in {{transient}} ionizing and single-event upset (SEU) {{radiation hardness}} of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology spurred {{much of its}} early development. Both of these advantages are {{a direct result of}} the reduced charge collection volume inherent to SOI technology. The fact that SOI transistor structures do not include parasitic n-p-n-p paths makes them immune to latchup. Even though considerable improvement in <b>transient</b> and single-event <b>radiation</b> hardness can be obtained by using SOI technology, there are some attributes of SOI devices and circuits that tend to limit their overall hardness. These attributes include the bipolar effect that can ultimately reduce the hardness of SOI ICs to SEU and <b>transient</b> ionizing <b>radiation,</b> and charge buildup in buried and sidewall oxides that can degrade the total-dose hardness of SOI devices. Nevertheless, high-performance SOI circuits can be fabricated that are hardened to both space and nuclear radiation environments, and radiation-hardened systems remain an active market for SOI devices.

40|$|Plasma {{generator}} is a {{core component}} in an electrothermal-chemical (ETC) launcher. Its work state directly influences the launch efficiency of a system. The interaction between plasma and propellants {{is a very}} important mechanism in ETC technology. Based on the <b>transient</b> <b>radiation</b> model and open air plasma jet experiment, the mechanism of plasma ignition process is analyzed. Results show that the surface temperature of local solid propellant grain can quickly achieve the ignition temperature under the action of early transient plasma radiation. But it needs enough time to maintain the high energy flow to make self-sustained combustion of solid propellant grains. Because of the limited space characteristics of <b>transient</b> <b>radiation,</b> the near-field propellant grains can gain enough energy by the strong <b>transient</b> <b>radiation</b> to be ignited and achieve self-sustained combustion. The far-field propellant grains mainly gain the energy by the activated particles in plasma jet to be ignited and self-sustained combustion. Experiments show that plasma jet always has a high flow velocity {{in the area of the}} cartridge. Compared with conventional ignition, the solid propellant grains can obtain more quick and uniform ignition and self-sustained combustion by this kind of ablation controlled arc (ACA) plasma via energy skin effect of propellant grains, pre-heat temperature mechanism and high efficient jet diffusion...|$|E

In this work the abilities on dead-time correction of a real-time digital pulse processing (DPP) system for high-rate high-resolution radiation measurements are presented. The DPP system, through a fast and slow {{analysis of the}} output waveform from radiation detectors, is able to perform multi-parameter analysis (arrival time, pulse width, pulse height, pulse shape, etc.) at high input counting rates (ICRs), allowing accurate counting loss corrections even for variable or <b>transient</b> <b>radiations.</b> The fast analysis is used to obtain both the ICR and energy spectra with high throughput, while the slow analysis is used to obtain high-resolution energy spectra. A complete characterization of the counting capabilities, through both theoretical and experimental approaches, was performed. The dead-time modeling, the throughput curves, the experimental time-interval distributions (TIDs) and the counting uncertainty of the recorded events of both the fast and the slow channels, measured with a planar CdTe (cadmium telluride) detector, will be presented. The throughput formula {{of a series of}} two types of dead-times is also derived. The results of dead-time corrections, performed through different methods, will be reported and discussed, pointing out the error on ICR estimation and the simplicity of the procedure. Accurate ICR estimations (nonlinearity < 0. 5 %) were performed by using the time widths and the TIDs (using 10 - 14;ns time bin width) of the detected pulses up to 2. 2 - 14;Mcps.
