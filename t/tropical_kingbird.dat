50|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} semi-open areas with trees and shrubs, including gardens and roadsides. <b>Tropical</b> <b>kingbirds</b> like to observe their surroundings from a prominent open perch, usually {{high in a}} tree, undertaking long sally flights to acrobatically catch insects in mid-air (hawking), sometimes hovering to pick food off vegetation (gleaning). They also eat some fruit from such diverse species as tamanqueiro (Alchornea glandulosa), the Annonaceae, Cymbopetalum mayanum and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba); foraging for these even in disturbed habitat. As they keep mainly to the upper levels of trees, they find little profit in following mixed-species feeding flocks in the understory.|$|R

Over 30 species of New World warbler are seen each year, with the yellow-rumped warbler being the most abundant.

40|$|ABSTRACT. — In October 2005, a vagrant kingbird (Aves: Tyrannus sp.) {{appeared}} in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, nearly 2000 km {{from the northern}} limit of its usual range. Using mitochondrial DNA obtained from a fecal sample deposited by the bird and mitochondrial DNA isolated from museum reference specimens, the species identity of this bird was definitively confirmed as a <b>Tropical</b> <b>Kingbird</b> (T. melancholicus) rather than a Couch’s Kingbird (T. couchii). This {{is the first time}} DNA evidence has been used to establish a state bird record, {{and one of the few}} studies of any type to successfully use avian feces for DNA analysis. Circumstantial evidence indicates that this bird was possibly displaced from its original range by Hurricane Wilma in October, 2005. Identification of vagrant birds is important for studying avian populations, and non-invasive genetic sampling techniques should be considered when traditional means of identification fail to provide definitive evidence of identity...|$|E
