2500|$|Sheet pile {{retaining}} walls are usually used in soft soil and tight spaces. Sheet pile walls are {{made out of}} steel, vinyl or wood planks which are driven into the ground. For a quick estimate the material is usually driven 1/3 above ground, 2/3 below ground, but this may be altered depending on the environment. Taller sheet pile walls will need a <b>tie-back</b> anchor, or [...] "dead-man" [...] placed in the soil a distance behind {{the face of the}} wall, that is tied to the wall, usually by a cable or a rod. Anchors are then placed behind the potential failure plane in the soil.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the western}} United States, {{much of what}} is seen as masonry is {{actually}} brick or stone veneer. Current construction rules dictate the amount of <b>tie–back</b> required, which consist of metal straps secured to vertical structural elements. These straps extend into mortar courses, securing the veneer to the primary structure. Older structures may not secure this sufficiently for seismic safety. A weakly secured veneer in a house interior (sometimes used to face a fireplace from floor to ceiling) can be especially dangerous to occupants. Older masonry chimneys are also dangerous if they have substantial vertical extension above the roof. These are prone to breakage at the roofline and may fall into the house in a single large piece. For retrofit, additional supports may be added; [...] however, it is extremely expensive to strengthen an existing masonry chimney to conform with contemporary design standards. [...] It is best to simply remove the extension and replace it with lighter materials, with special metal flue replacing the flue tile and a wood structure replacing the masonry. This may be matched against existing brickwork by using very thin veneer (similar to a tile, but with the appearance of a brick).|$|E

60|$|I wish to {{celebrate}} {{it because it}} seems to me one of the frankest expressions of national taste and nature, and I do like simplicity--in others. The modern Italians are the most literal of the realists in all the arts, and, as I had striven for reality in my own poor way, I was perhaps the more curious to see its effects in sculpture which I had heard of so much. I will own that they went far beyond my expectation and possibly my wishes; but it is not to be supposed that it is only inferior artists who have abandoned themselves to the excesses of fidelity so abundant in the Campo Santo. There are, of course, enough poor falterings of allegory and tradition in the marble walls and floors of this vast residence of the dead (as it gives you the cheerful impression of being), but the characteristic note of the place is a realism braving it out in every extreme of actuality. Possibly the fact is most striking in that death-bed scene where the family, life-size and unsparingly portraitured, and, as it were, photographed in marble, are gathered in the room of the dying mother. She lies on a bedstead which bears every mark of being one of a standard chamber-set in the early eighteen-seventies, and about her stand her husband and her sons and daughters and their wives and husbands, in the fashions of that day. I recall a brother, in a cutaway coat, and a daughter, in a <b>tie-back,</b> embraced in their grief and turning their faces away from their mother toward the spectator; and doubtless there were others whom to describe in their dress would render as grotesque. It is enough to say that the artist, of a name well known in Italy and of uncommon gift, has been as true to the moment in their costume as to the eternal humanity in their faces. He has done what the sculptor or painter of the great periods of art used to do with their historical and scriptural people--he has put them in the dress of his own time and place; and it is impossible to deny him a convincing logic. No sophistry or convention of drapery in the scene could have conveyed its pathos half so well, or indeed at all. It does make you shudder, I allow; it sets your teeth on edge; but then, if you are a real man or woman, it brings the lump into your throat; the smile fails from your lip; you pay the tribute of genuine pity and awe. I will not pretend that I was so much moved by the meeting in heaven of a son and father: the spirit of the son in a cutaway, with a derby hat in his hand, gazing with rapture into the face of the father's spirit in a long sack-coat holding his marble bowler elegantly away from his side, if I remember rightly. But here the fact wanted the basis of simplicity so strong in the other scene; in the mixture of the real and the ideal the group was romanticistic.|$|E

25|$|One form of {{retrofit}} is {{to drill}} numerous holes into {{the surface of}} the wall, and secure short L-shaped sections of rebar to the surface of each hole with epoxy adhesive. Additional vertical and horizontal rebar is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional footings in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and <b>tie-backs</b> to retain the span on the bounding walls.|$|R
5000|$|In its most-basic form, a drape or curtain bind often {{consists}} of a ring and a pin: the curtain is [...] "bound" [...] inside the ring by {{the placement of the}} pin behind it, holding the curtain {{in the center of the}} window rather than along its edge as with most <b>tie-backs.</b> Alternatively, a double-slotted piece of wood or plastic resembling a figure-8 can be used to the same effect. This arrangement is only possible with very brief or sheer curtains.|$|R
50|$|A {{structured}} <b>tie-back</b> {{consists of}} a single short U-shaped strip of fabric held flat by a piece of interfacing. A ring (often metal, sometimes wood or plastic) is placed {{at each end of}} the strip, and the strip is looped around the curtain to hold it in the open position. Both rings are then hung on a peg or hook on a nearby frame or wall.|$|E

50|$|Note that a {{tree and}} {{wellhead}} are separate pieces of equipment not to be mistaken as the same piece. The Christmas tree is installed {{on top of the}} wellhead. A wellhead is used without a Christmas tree during drilling operations, and also for riser <b>tie-back</b> situations that later would have a tree installed at riser top. Wells being produced with rod pumps (pump jacks, nodding donkeys, grasshopper pumps, and so on) frequently do not utilize any tree owing the absence of a pressure-containment requirement.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and <b>tie-backs</b> made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and <b>tie-backs.</b> Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a jacquard weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|R

Specifically, this project focuses on the technical flow assurance feasibility of configurations involving Technip’s Integrated Production Bundle and ETH-PiP technologies in combination with concepts such as subsea MEG (Monoethylene Glycol) storage at well site. Results show the impact of the passive insulation properties of the aforementioned technologies reduces MEG requirements for the given scenario and potentially eliminates the need for continuous MEG injection at steady state. The effectiveness of using well site MEG to dissociate hydrate formed in the flowline on restart is investigated in the MEG Bladder scenario...|$|R
