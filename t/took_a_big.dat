5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E

Before WCW's collapse, she engaged in a brief feud with Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas, who defeated her and partner Billy Kidman at Fall Brawl in a Mixed Tag Team Scaffold match. Madusa <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> bump during this match and wasn't seen again on WCW TV. She left the company when she heard that Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} World Wrestling Federation, was going to buy WCW. Because she had a previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company. She retired from professional wrestling for good in 2001 because she did not like the direction in which women's wrestling was going; according to her, it was becoming less about real wrestling and more about Bra and Panties matches.|$|E

25|$|Hart {{was back}} in time for {{what would be a}} memorable Finals series. In the Qualifying Final defeat to arch-rivals Carlton, Hart kicked five goals and was among Richmond's best players. He was again among {{the best players in the}} {{cut-throat}} Semi-final against St Kilda, but had to get his knee drained of fluid the following Monday and continued limping until the Wednesday. Desperate to have him play, the selectors put him on the bench (in this era a replacement could only be used once) for the Preliminary Final against and watched forlornly as the Tigers slipped to a six-goal deficit at half time. Coach Tom Hafey <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> risk by bringing Hart on at this point; Hart's inspirational performance in booting two goals lifted the Tigers to an amazing victory, thus underlining Hart's reputation as one of the truly great leaders in the game. In the 1973 VFL Grand Final, Hart dominated against Carlton, winning 19 possessions, seven marks and kicking three goals, even though his knee had improved only marginally since the previous week.|$|E

25|$|On August 1 of {{this year}} the 1929 Palestine riots broke out between Palestinians and Jews {{over control of the}} Western Wall. The rioting, {{initiated}} in part when British police tore down a screen the Jews had constructed in front of the Wall, continued {{until the end of the}} month. In total, 133 Jews and 116 Palestinians were killed. Two of the more famous incidents occurring during these riots were the August 23–24 1929 Hebron massacre, in which almost 70 Jews were killed by Palestinians and the remaining Jews are forced to stay at Hebron. The Palestinians had been told that Jews were killing Palestinians. Jews would not return to Hebron until after the Six-Day War in 1967. The other major clash was the 1929 Safed massacre, in which 18–20 Jews were killed by Palestinians in Safed in similar fashion. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Iraq <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> step toward gaining independence from the British. The Iraqi government had, since the end of World War I and the beginning of the British Mandate in the Middle East, consistently resisted British hegemony. In September, Great Britain announced it would support Iraq's inclusion in the League of Nations, signaling the beginning of the end of their direct control of the region.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the first}} {{commercial}} television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939 over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors {{at the time to}} have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for Ivory Soap, he held up a bar of the product; for Mobilgas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel; and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> spoonful. Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed {{in the early years of}} the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program.|$|E

It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|After McCoy led the Longhorns to {{a victory}} over rival, unranked Texas A (a team he had lost to twice in the past), Sports Illustrated analyst Stewart Mandel said the quarterback <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> step towards {{claiming}} the Heisman Trophy. Mandel wrote, [...] "From the Longhorns' opening touchdown drive, in which he accounted for 67 of Texas' 80 yards, McCoy was very much the one-man wrecking crew he's been all season long...His final numbers in just over three quarters of work Thursday night: 23-of-28 passing for 311 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and 11 rushes for 49 yards, with touchdown runs of 16 and 14 yards. For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands out to me. Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. With all due respect to Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you have to wonder sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right back in there the next series." [...] Bradford and Harrell each had one regular-season game left, against Oklahoma State and Baylor, respectively. Tebow had games remaining against Florida State and Alabama.|$|E
500|$|Vikram then {{featured}} in Mani Ratnam's bilingual films Raavanan and Raavan, {{inspired by the}} ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, with Vikram featuring as the tribal leader, Veeraiya, in the Tamil version and the cop, Dev Pratap Sharma, in the Hindi version of the films which were shot simultaneously. Vikram revealed that changes between the two characters during filming took up to 45 minutes, with Abhishek Bachchan playing the tribal leader in the Hindi version whilst Prithviraj played the cop in the Tamil version, with Aishwarya Rai also in the cast. Vikram was initially apprehensive because both roles were to be shot almost simultaneously but revealed he succeeded by showing differences in his body language and expressions. Vikram revealed that he and Abhishek Bachchan played the roles in the respective versions without inspiration from one another. Despite being a non-speaker and making his debut in Hindi, he dubbed his lines in the language remarking jovially it was the [...] "most difficult thing in the world". After promotions at the Cannes Film Festival and a premiere at Leicester Square in London, the two versions and the dubbed Telugu version released simultaneously in 2,200 screens worldwide and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> opening on day one earning 20 crores. The Tamil version, Raavanan won rave reviews from critics with The Hindu calling it a [...] "masterstroke" [...] and claiming Vikram [...] "raises the bar higher with every venture". The critic cited that [...] "emotions of love, animus, anguish and joy dance on his face in quick succession", concluding that [...] "Vikram lifts the role to an admirable level". The critic from Sify labelled it as a [...] "astonishing portrayal", while the critic from the Hindustan Times praised Vikram's [...] "ability to get into Veeraiya's skin and emote with conviction". The Tamil version consequently {{went on to become}} a commercial success, with Vikram's performance leading to him winning the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor among other accolades. In contrast, the Hindi version fetched mixed reviews with critics agreeing that Vikram's performance as the tribal leader was more convincing than Bachchan's. Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express rated the film 4/5 and said [...] "Raavan falls for Sita (and vice versa) in an intriguingly idiosyncratic take on the Ramayana– if you can get past the lead performances, that is" [...] whereas Taran Adarsh, writing for Bollywood Hungama rated it 1.5/5 and said, [...] "On the whole, Raavan is a king-sized disappointment, in terms of content" [...] though mentioning that Vikram was [...] "first-rate, although the role isn't substantial enough". Raavan subsequently {{went on to become a}} surprise flop at the Indian box office. The film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival, with Vikram in attendance.|$|E
