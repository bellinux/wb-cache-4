5|$|As {{the highway}} enters Wake County, the name changes to Durham Road, which stays {{the name of}} the road until Wake Forest. After an {{intersection}} with Old Creedmoor Road, NC 98 and NC 50 have a cloverleaf interchange. Continuing to the east, the road intersects Six Forks and New Light Roads, before once again crossing over Falls Lake. After passing by several neighborhoods and crossing over Falls Lake two more times, the road intersects Thompson Mill Road, where it widens from a two lane road to a four lane divided highway. After about , the road intersects both Falls of the Neuse Road and NC 98 Bus. The name Durham Road changes to follow NC 98 Business and NC 98 continues to become the Dr. Calvin Jones Highway. After passing by the Wakefield neighborhood, the road has a single point urban interchange with US 1 (Capital Boulevard). Continuing straight it goes on to intersects Galaxy Drive, US 1A (South Main Street), Franklin Street, and Heritage Lake Road, before meeting back up with NC 98 Bus. at <b>the</b> <b>Wait</b> Avenue/Jones Dairy Road intersection. After the intersection, NC 98 changes back into a two lane road, carrying <b>the</b> <b>Wait</b> Avenue name. The highway passes through a very rural area east of Wake Forest, with a few neighborhoods present. Wait Avenue intersects Averette Road at a stoplight, and then continues on to intersect NC 96 just north of Rolesville.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a series of model simulations on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list for residential care of the mentally disabled in the Netherlands. The model assesses the number of mentally disabled in the Netherlands, the institutional and semi-institutional residential care and <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> lists for these types of care. Future developments in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list are explored by means of studying scenarios showing the effects on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list of alternative forms of ambulatory care, a lower level of outflow from <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list, an improved waiting-list registration and the increased survival of the mentally disabled population in residential care. The period 1996 - 2010 shows a {{growth in the number of}} mentally disabled in the Dutch population of 5. 0 % (from 104, 400 to 109, 700). In the subsequent years 2010 - 2020 the growth gradually decreases. There are increasing numbers of ageing mentally disabled persons: in the period 1996 - 2020, the number of mentally disabled over 65 years of age shows more than a doubling. In the reference scenario, based on developments in the 1996 - 1998 period, <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list for residential care of the mentally disabled increases from over 6, 800 clients in 1996 to 8, 200 in 2000. After this year <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list decreases due to an assumed decreasing inflow into and a larger outflow from <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list, partly because of a growing capacity of the institutions. The scenario home-care describes the situation in which after 2002 provision of suitable alternative ambulatory care reduces the inflow into <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list by 38 %. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list decreases rapidly to 3, 000 in 2010 and less than 1, 000 in 2020. The scenario less outflow takes a variant assumption on the unspecified fraction of the outflow data in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list registration, resulting in a reduced outflow to other care than institutional and semi-institutional residential care. In this scenario, <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list increases to 10, 900 in 2007, after which a decrease follows to 9, 600 in 2020. <b>The</b> scenario clean <b>waiting</b> list assumes, based on actual data from a regional investigation, that <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list has a 20 % over-registration. In this scenario <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list develops from 5, 500 in 1996 to a maximum of 6, 800 in 1999. After this year <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list decreases to 4, 600 in 2010 and 3, 500 in 2020. Finally, in the scenario improved survival the mortality rates of the mentally disabled in the institutions in the period 2000 - 2020 are assumed to be reduced by 10 %. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list increases to 8, 200 clients in 2000. After this year <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list decreases to 4, 900 clients in 2020. In order to make more accurate projections of possible bottlenecks in providing appropriate care for the mentally disabled, it is important to update the estimate of the number of mentally handicapped in the population and to improve the waiting-list registration and the quality of semi-institutional registration. The developed model can be expanded to study regional aspects of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list problem, cost allocations, and the effects of changing incidences of mental handicap...|$|R
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it.

30|$|For {{the high}} {{priority}} (HP) traffic, <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> time of HP arrivals during Y {{in a system}} empty of HP packets {{is affected by the}} presence of LP packets.

That is, while <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> time of <b>the</b> HP packets is affected by the lower class, both <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> time and <b>the</b> completion time of LP packets are affected by HP traffic.

40|$|Background: In lung {{transplantation}} (LTx), {{allocation of}} donor lungs is usually based on blood group, height and waiting time. Long waiting times favor {{patients with a}} slowly progressive end-stage lung disease and make the current allocation system the subject of discussion. In an attempt to equalize the chances for transplantation for every patient, irrespective of diagnosis, we investigated the effect of diagnosis-dependent prioritization on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list, using a simulation model. Methods: For the main disease categories on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list, <b>the</b> relative risks of dying while on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list were calculated using empirical data from the Dutch LTx program gathered {{over a period of}} 10 years. In a microsimulation model of the Dutch LTx program based on data from the actual situation, patients with diagnoses associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death while on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list were prioritized by multiplying the time on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list by <b>the</b> relative risk. Results: Relative risks of death on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list were increased significantly in patients with cystic fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Prioritization resulted in an increased chance of transplantation for the prioritized diagnoses and a decreased chance for the non-prioritized diagnoses. The distribution of diagnoses after LTx was almost equal to the distribution of diagnoses on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list. Conclusion: <b>The</b> simulated method of prioritization on <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list is a step forward to a more equitable allocation of donor lungs. Moreover, this method is clinically feasible, as long as <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> list is updated frequently...|$|R

25|$|Peru was reintegrated {{into the}} global {{economic}} system, and began to attract foreign investment. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, {{at a cost of}} $607 for a residential line. A couple of years after privatization, <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> was reduced to just a few days.

Average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before privatization) to two months in 1996 (after privatization).
