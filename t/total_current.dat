25|$|To prevent electrocution, RCDs should {{operate within}} 25–40 {{milliseconds}} with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30 mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, {{the most common}} cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the <b>total</b> <b>current</b> is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, can be a very serious fault, but would probably not increase the <b>total</b> <b>current</b> enough for a fuse or circuit breaker to break the circuit, and certainly not do so fast enough to save a life.|$|E
25|$|Subjecting {{the tube}} to {{asymmetric}} waveforms, where the <b>total</b> <b>current</b> {{flow through the}} tube does not cancel out and the tube effectively operates under a DC bias, causes asymmetric distribution of mercury ions along the tube due to cataphoresis. The localized depletion of mercury vapor pressure manifests as pink luminescence of the base gas {{in the vicinity of}} one of the electrodes, and the operating lifetime of the lamp may be dramatically shortened. This can be an issue with some poorly designed inverters.|$|E

25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} <b>total</b> <b>current</b> {{supplied}} is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive {{and has to be}} made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that causes the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacity.|$|E

25|$|A {{photodiode}} is a p–n junction or PIN structure. When a photon {{of sufficient}} energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism {{is also known}} as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The <b>total</b> <b>current</b> through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.|$|E

25|$|X {{is one of}} {{the five}} mtDNA haplogroups found in Indigenous Amerindian peoples. Unlike the four main American mtDNA haplogroups (A, B, C and D), X is not at all {{strongly}} associated with east Asia. Haplogroup X genetic sequences diverged about 20,000 to 30,000 years ago to give two sub-groups, X1 and X2. X2's subclade X2a occurs only at a frequency of about 3% for the <b>total</b> <b>current</b> indigenous population of the Americas. However, X2a is a major mtDNA subclade in North America; among the Algonquian peoples, it comprises up to 25% of mtDNA types. It is also present in lower percentages to the west and south of this area — among the Sioux (15%), the Nuu-chah-nulth (11%–13%), the Navajo (7%), and the Yakama (5%). Haplogroup X is more strongly present in the Near East, the Caucasus, and Mediterranean Europe. The predominant theory for sub-haplogroup X2a's appearance in North America is migration along with A, B, C, and D mtDNA groups, from a source in the Altai Mountains of central Asia.|$|E
