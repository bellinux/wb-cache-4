5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but, even if <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>their</b> manes will be only around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E

25|$|Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} first game, duels are also common. During duels, the {{character}} and the enemy will slowly circle one another, with the player needing to keep the character's hand as close to his gun as possible by moving the left analog stick/mouse. However, they cannot touch their gun, as if <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>their</b> hand is automatically moved away. At the same time, the player needs to keep the opponent lined up in {{the centre of the}} screen by using the right analog stick or keyboard. When the time comes to draw, a bell rings, and the player has only a very brief window in which to draw, aim and fire.|$|E
25|$|Many more pitams are {{preserved}} today {{due to an}} auxin discovered by Dr. Eliezer E. Goldschmidt, emeritus professor of horticulture at the Hebrew University. Working with the picloram hormone in a citrus orchard, he unexpectedly discovered {{that some of the}} Valencia oranges found nearby had preserved perfect pitams. Citrus fruits, other than an etrog or citron hybrid like the bergamot, usually do not preserve their pitam. On the occasions that <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> <b>their</b> pitams tend to be dry, sunken and very fragile. In this case the pitams were all fresh and solid just like those of the Moroccan or Greek citron varieties. Experimenting with picloram in a laboratory, Goldschmidt eventually found the correct “dose” to achieve the desired effect is one droplet of the chemical in three million drops of water. This invention was highly appreciated by the religious Jewish community.|$|E

However, he was {{disappointed}} that {{he was unable to}} get practice runs before the qualifying session as he felt that he could have started in a higher position. Bräck stated that he lost the chance of victory when a crew member dropped a wheel nut on his final pit stop, saying: [...] "There is something hanging over us. I do my part, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> part. When everyone is having a good day you win. If not, you lose." [...] Fernández was angry with the pit lane speeding penalty, saying he felt he could have achieved a better finishing position and that the rule on pit lane speeding could [...] "ruin your day". After the race, he spent several hours discussing the penalty with race officials. John Lopes, the CART Vice President of Racing Operations, later stated that the series would investigate the rules regarding pit lane speeding penalties but affirmed that no action could be taken until after the season's end.|$|E

Their version peaked at number 20 in Britain, but by their standards at the time, it was one of their least successful singles. Many listeners perceived the song as the Hollies attempting to align themselves with the Beatles. In one of his articles covering the Beatles' concurrent UK tour, Alan Smith of the NME quoted Harrison as saying that the Hollies' version was [...] "rubbish" [...] and that [...] "the way <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> records, they sound like session men who've just got together in a studio without ever seeing each other before. Technically good, yes. But that's all." [...] Lennon also criticised their treatment of the song, having long disliked the Hollies' sound. These comments incensed Nash, who responded by saying that he was tired of Lennon's continual insults and would [...] "back any of us boys against the Beatles musically any time". In January 1966, at a press conference following his and Boyd's wedding, Harrison laughed off a reporter's question as to whether he had invited the Hollies to the ceremony, adding that the issue had [...] "just got out of hand".|$|E
