Several teams were formed around the end of the 19th century, but most folded during the depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926 and Mid-Rhondda in 1928. The most successful club from the area is Ton Pentre F.C..|$|E
5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few,</b> if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 review, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> {{studies on}} the {{efficacy}} of Proactiv. A 2011 Consumer Reports study compared Proactiv with two less expensive types of benzoyl peroxide, AcneFree and OXY Maximum, and found all three to be equally effective. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in 2014 that over-the-counter acne treatments can cause severe irritation, as well as rare but life-threatening allergic reactions.|$|E

5|$|Proactiv {{is aimed}} at {{customers}} with mild to moderate acne. According to a 2011 review, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> studies examining its efficacy. A 2007 study saw inflammatory lesions reduced by 39 percent in subjects {{using a combination of}} butenafine and benzoyl peroxide, compared with 34 percent in those using Proactiv containing only benzoyl peroxide. A physician suggested in Salon that its three-step system might make it easier for teenagers to comply, but that the key to its success lay with its celebrity endorsements.|$|E
5|$|The AACAP {{guidelines}} {{state that}} children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. However, the course of RAD is not well studied and <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing longitudinal studies (dealing with developmental change with age {{over a period of}} time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> {{accidents}} at Waterloo {{compared to}} other London terminal stations. On 21 August 1896, an engine leaving the locomotive yard overran its clearance point, colliding with a departing passenger train. Five passengers were injured. On 5 May 1904, a linesman accidentally stepped on a signal wire. This gave a false clear signal to a goods van, which collided with a passenger train, killing one, while on 25 October 1913, a collision between two passenger trains at Waterloo Junction killed three people.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} work {{took place}} in the later part of the 15thcentury. It is thought that it began with the south arcade, followed by the north arcade and the addition of a clerestory. The rebuilding was probably complete by about 1525, although the north aisle may not have been completely re-roofed until the early 17thcentury. The west porch was probably started in the 14thcentury, and the upper two storeys added in the following century. The nave roof was repaired in 1615. During the civil war, while nearby Biddulph Hall was under siege, SirWilliam Brereton's Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. They damaged the medieval glass windows and removed some of the church furniture, including the organ. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> significant changes since that time. The church was restored during the 19thcentury by Anthony Salvin, and later, in about 1857, by George Gilbert Scott, who removed plaster from the walls and built a small gallery. During the Victorian era, the reredos and most of the stained glass were added.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>few</b> attempts {{to define the}} nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
