5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> body. Gamma radiation can go all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> network from the one user to the other.|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me is {{the ninth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E

50|$|The silver pentacle amulet {{he wears}} about his neck {{serves as an}} impromptu magical focus and often a divination aid to find his brother Thomas, his dog Mouse, or whoever else he might be looking for. This amulet has been {{enhanced}} with a pentagonal ruby gifted {{to him by his}} mother, held in trust by the Leanansidhe, granting him access to his mother’s knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Nevernever.|$|R
5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside {{to the inside of the}} cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E
5|$|The New York Automobile Club {{released}} another plan in 1933. This plan made {{no changes}} to NY9A; however, US9 {{was changed to}} use Broadway all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bronx and to travel to New Jersey {{by way of the}} Holland Tunnel. In the final plan implemented in mid-December 1934, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive–Amsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, NY9A used what had been planned as US9, splitting at Broadway and Dyckman Street. NY9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on Riverside Drive and the West Side Elevated Highway (detouring around an unfinished section via 57th Street, Eleventh Avenue and 48th Street) to end at the entrance and exit plazas of the Holland Tunnel. US9 was shifted northward to enter New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{specimen}} MACN Pv-RN 975, {{first described}} by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, {{may be a}} jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium, although {{it has also been}} identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and the piece of the jawbone below it. A diastema (gap) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it. The alveolus (socket) of the lower incisor extends all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges {{on both sides of the}} longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back. The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from cusps on the upper margin, and roots at the front and back. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel {{is made up of}} small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E

25|$|In this mechanism, pollen tube {{elongation}} is halted {{when it has}} proceeded {{approximately one}} third of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> style. The female component ribonuclease, termed S-RNase probably causes degradation of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) inside the pollen tube, {{in the case of}} identical male and female S alleles, and consequently pollen tube elongation is arrested, and the pollen grain dies.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{speculation}} that the barge may have caused the other nearby breaches in the Industrial Canal by striking the floodwalls {{on the other side}} before bouncing back and going all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> levee near the end of Prieur Street, although all the scientists and engineers who investigated the failures regard such speculation as dubious and without any evidentiary basis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method for}} {{piercing}} ears, first made {{popular in the}} 1960s, {{was the use of}} sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as self-piercers, trainers, or sleepers, which gradually pushed through the earlobe. However, these could slip from their initial placement position, often resulting in more discomfort, and many times would not go all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> earlobe without additional pressure being applied. This method has fallen into disuse due to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques.|$|E
