The generating area of the tsunami, estimated by means of an inverse <b>travel</b> <b>chart</b> of the wave front based on the arrival time of the initial motion of the tsunami to the coastal station, is located in the sea on the continental shelf, extending about 90 km in an elongated shape roughly parallel to the coast line from the northern part of Niigata Prefecture to Yamagata Prefecture...|$|E
40|$|PT. XYZ a {{manufacturing}} factory that produce travel bags which {{is interested in}} market both domestic and aboard. In product marketing, primary oriented to export that has wide scale. By focusing on export these travel bags, PT. XYZ is demanded to improve the quantity of product in order to fulfil the production target without negleted the quality. Infact, this target often cannot be reached. This fact surely harms to the factory. It is caused by some factors such as: the lack of machines they used and the form of factory's location order that doesnot support the productivity. In this occasion the writer tries to analyse the position order in PT. XYZ by using <b>Travel</b> <b>Chart</b> method or is called From To Chart which is done manually and by helping of QS software {{in order to get}} an accurate result. The aim of this analysis is to minimize material handling so it is hoped that the position order can be used to maximize the target that has been planed...|$|E
40|$|Layout of {{production}} facility {{is a problem}} which often be found in industrialized worlds. Production facility layout {{played an important role}} in the efficiency of the production process and material handling process in the industrial facility. PT. Abattoir Surya Jaya is an industry that provides meat. The application of inappropriate layouts can reduce productivity and quality of the product because fatigue and long production process. It can be proved with the appearance of backtracking factor in stimulation room, chilling room, bonning room,blast freezer,and packaging. Production process should according to statutes which is line flow. From to chart sometimes called trip frequency chart or <b>travel</b> <b>chart</b> is one convensional technique which commond used for material handling and factory layout planning in one production process. Basically from to chart is an adaptation from mileage chart which commond founded in a road map, the numbers which is in from to chart would show total of load weight that should be moved and the distance of material handling.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I follow nomadic {{passages}} in the memoir of Sofia Laskaridou, a Greek woman artist. I am interested into how her dislocation from familiar places and {{spaces in the}} beginning of the twentieth century opened up unforeseen territories for her self to be constituted as a <b>travel</b> logbook, a <b>chart</b> tracing paths of becoming. As a writer and painter of her own modernity, Laskaridou reconstitutes herself in retracing her paths in the cities she lived as a young art student. However in writing herself in space, she also rewrites the city, offering insights in the experience of the spaces of modernity from a range of marginalised subject positions, in terms of gender and geography. In observing modern life within the discourse of the aesthetic and the limitations of her own time, class, culture and geographies, Laskaridou’s memoir becomes a site of contestation and her autobiographical map rather chaotic. What I argue is that as she moves on, she leaves herself behind, continuously becoming-other as she creates real-and-imaginary connections with the spaces she temporarily inhabits. In this light, nomadism becomes an effective conceptual tool for making cartographies of gendered spatial practices in becoming a woman and an artist...|$|R
40|$|In this, {{the first}} of six interviews, Lord Phillips of Ellesmere KBE FRS, reviews the times of his boyhood, parents, family, {{impressions}} of Ellesmere in the 1920 s and 1930 s, early schooling and railway <b>travels.</b> Initial discussion <b>charts</b> the branches of his family, the Phillips, Bagnalls, Finneys and Woods, followed by reference to strong Methodist traditions and his father's service to the local Wesleyan circuit as a lay-preacher. Patterns {{of life in a}} cottage 'sandwiched between the local workhouse and the cemetery' emerge, with reference to his father's tailoring workshop and its formative experiences. The story then turns to influential grandparents and cousins, including grandfather Samuel Finney, an early socialist MP in industrial Staffordshire, in whose home in Burslem he was destined to spend time as a rather retiring child. There is also reference to Eglantyne Jebb's family, an aunt influencing the career horizons of a number of relations. Recollections then turn to a tough local primary school regime, prolonged isolation with diphtheria, and early friendships and adventures, including swimming the Mere. A transfer to Oswestry High School follows, strengthening academic interests and introducing science to the story, a story coloured by vivid recall throughout, recall of travels in an age of steam, Boys Own Paper admiration for Blackburn Rovers, and times spent watching Gloucestershire cricket in the days of Hammond. It is from these foundations that Interview II progresses to undergraduate years and their wartime channelling of interests into radio-communications, short-term service as a radar officer in the Royal Navy, finally first steps in x-ray crystallography...|$|R
40|$|The man penetrates {{deeper into}} the mysteries of matter, space and time in the {{evolutionary}} development. He has only started the practical development of near space, but he already begins to travel into its depth in his dreams. One of the attributes of long-duration space <b>travel</b> is navigation <b>charts</b> (models) of the Universe considering an exact arrangement of cosmic bodies and their gravitationalfields in space. For drawing up of such charts of the starry sky from the Earth {{it is necessary to}} consider a number of paradoxes which arise at the present system understanding of the Universe, such as its virtuality realities of the Big Bang, maximum flying speed, etc. Today we can fly away to the star worlds, which have not already been, and on the way to meet the worlds which have not been visible from the Earth yet. In the starry sky we see the story of stars removed from us for light years. Flight to these objects is the movement from their stories to reality. Training of their crews and staff will be not less important problem by the spaceship. Firstly, they will be trained on the Earth and then only in the flying using a simple self-improved system of training relevant staff. Today scientists and researchers did a huge groundwork in the field of space and the mass movement of enthusiasts has already started the implementation. It is pleasant, that the number of such enthusiasts already leads to practical qualitative changes, and it becomes the fact: different kind of space travel which is fast approaching reality...|$|R
