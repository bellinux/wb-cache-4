25|$|In {{principle}} {{confidence intervals}} can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), {{but it can}} also be asymmetrical because the <b>two</b> <b>sided</b> interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.|$|E
