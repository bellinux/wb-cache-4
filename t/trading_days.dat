25|$|Ex-dividend date — the day {{on which}} shares bought and sold no longer come {{attached}} {{with the right to}} be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> before the record date. This is an important date for any company that has many stockholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing holders of the stock will receive the dividend even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of the dividend.|$|E
500|$|The euro fell {{against the}} US dollar {{for the two}} <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> {{preceding}} the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout. Questions were raised whether {{the fall of the}} US dollar to a one-year low could be stemmed. The questions were partially answered on the last trading day before the election, when the dollar rose on concern for a shake-up for European confidence {{as a result of the}} election which caused bearish traders to cover their open positions. The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to worry that they may not be able to count on Finland's future support for any such bailout measure. Concerns for the euro grew in the run-up to the election and caused worry after the result. Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks, expected to be concluded in mid-May, were affected. While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed, [...] "caution" [...] was said to be the [...] "watchword." [...] The London Stock Exchange also considered the result a possible obstruction to the bailout.|$|E

2500|$|Braudel and Reynold {{have made}} a {{systematic}} study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century. [...] Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held {{once or twice a}} week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods travelled relatively short distances– grain 5–10 miles; cattle 40–70 miles; wool and wollen cloth 20–40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar– calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum [...] and coffee from the New World.|$|E

50|$|<b>Day</b> <b>trading</b> is {{speculation}} in securities, specifically {{buying and}} selling financial instruments within the same <b>trading</b> <b>day.</b> Strictly, <b>day</b> <b>trading</b> is trading only within a day, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the <b>trading</b> <b>day.</b> Many traders {{may not be so}} strict or may have <b>day</b> <b>trading</b> as one component of an overall strategy.

Cargo vessels known as lakers haul grain, coal, and iron ore from the Lake Superior ports of Duluth, Superior, Two Harbors, and Silver Bay, through Lake Superior to the lower Great Lakes, while ocean-going ships referred to as salties operate from the Twin Ports through the St. Lawrence Seaway to the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} {{unusual for a}} Yukon Indian, but Klakee-Nah was an unusual Indian. Not alone did he like to render inordinate hospitality, but, what of being a chief and of {{acquiring}} much money, {{he was able to}} do it. In the primitive <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> he had been a power over his people, and he had dealt profitably with the white trading companies. Later on, with Porportuk, he had made a gold-strike on the Koyokuk River. Klakee-Nah was by training and nature an aristocrat. Porportuk was bourgeois, and Porportuk bought him out of the gold-mine. Porportuk was content to plod and accumulate. Klakee-Nah went back to his large house and proceeded to spend. Porportuk was known as the richest Indian in Alaska. Klakee-Nah was known as the whitest. Porportuk was a money-lender and a usurer. Klakee-Nah was an anachronism—a mediæval ruin, a fighter and a feaster, happy with wine and song.|$|E
