5|$|On December 2, Michigan {{defeated}} Syracuse in a ACC-Big Ten Challenge {{game that}} went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> After blowing a 10-point second half lead Michigan needed a three point shot from Albrecht with 31 seconds remaining for the victory. On December 6, Michigan suffered its first home loss of the season to the New Jersey Institute of Technology by a 72–70 margin, despite a career-high 32 points by Levert. With the loss, Michigan's 30-game home win streak versus unranked opponents was snapped. NJIT shot 11-for-17 on its three-point shots in the game. The team lost its three subsequent games to Eastern Michigan, (#3) Arizona, and SMU. The loss to Eastern Michigan, which is separated from the University of Michigan by a 6-mile stretch of Washtenaw Avenue, ended a Big Ten-high 59-game streak without consecutive losses. Eastern Michigan was led in assists (6) by Michael Talley, son of Michigan Basketball point guard and alum Michael Talley, Jr. The December 9 80–53 loss to #3 ranked Arizona was one point shy of being the largest defeat of the Beilein era. The December 20 SMU game marked the first career start by Ricky Doyle. On December 22, the team snapped its 4-game losing streak with a victory over Coppin State who was coached by Michael Grant, the brother of former Wolverine and Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Gary Grant. One of the game's big storylines was the first regular season point by Austin Hatch. Doyle's game-high 16 points {{marked the first time}} he led the team in scoring. Michigan won its Big Ten Conference home opener against Illinois in overtime on December 30 on the day it announced Jim Harbaugh would become the new Michigan Wolverines football head coach. Aubrey Dawkins, who had a career total of 15 points entering the game, scored a game-high 20-points.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of an apparatus and method that combines a signal generator and a passive signal receiver to detect and record the path of partially or completely concealed electrical <b>wiring</b> without disturbing <b>the</b> concealing surface. The signal generator applies a series of electrical pulses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> selected <b>wiring</b> of interest. <b>The</b> applied pulses create a magnetic field about <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> that can be detected by a coil contained within the signal receiver. An audible output connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receiver and driven by the coil reflects the receiver`s position with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wiring.</b> <b>The</b> receiver`s audible signal is strongest when the receiver is directly above <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> and <b>the</b> long axis of the receiver`s coil is parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wiring.</b> A marking means is mounted on <b>the</b> receiver <b>to</b> mark <b>the</b> location of <b>the</b> <b>wiring</b> as <b>the</b> receiver is directed over the wiring`s concealing surface.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of arrays of electrodeposited Co nanowires {{have been studied}} by ferromagnetic resonance {{as a function of}} the electrolytic bath acidity and the plating current intensity. It is observed that by adjusting the pH or the plating current it is possible to find appropriate electrolyte-deposition conditions which lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deposition of Co nanowires with a c-axis orientation either parallel or perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> At relatively high plating currents, systems containing a dominant fraction of grains having the c-axis oriented perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> are favoured. Such wires show a significant decrease of the effective anisotropy due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> competition between the magnetocrystalline and the shape anisotropy that can be as low as 4. 3 kOe. In contrast, at low plating currents the c-axis is aligned parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> and an effective anisotropy field, that can be as high as 12 kOe, is observed...|$|R

25|$|Cathode strip {{chambers}} (CSC) {{are used}} in the endcap disks where the magnetic field is uneven and particle rates are high. CSCs consist of arrays of positively charged “anode” wires crossed with negatively charged copper “cathode” strips within a gas volume. When muons pass through, they knock electrons off the gas atoms, which flock to the anode wires creating an avalanche of electrons. Positive ions move away from the wire and towards the copper cathode, also inducing a charge pulse in the strips, at right angles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> direction. Because the strips and the wires are perpendicular, we get two position coordinates for each passing particle. In addition to providing precise space and time information, the closely spaced wires make the CSCs fast detectors suitable for triggering. Each CSC module contains six layers making it able to accurately identify muons and match their tracks to those in the tracker.|$|E

This was Bula's last century, and indeed his last score above 30 – as he was pushed down the order to No. 6 against Wellington, he made 23 and 26, but Wellington still forced a 117-run win, before Bula rounded off his first class career with a seven-wicket win over Auckland – in a match that was shortened from three days to one due to rain.
