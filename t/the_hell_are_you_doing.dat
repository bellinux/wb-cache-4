What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> First I pick up my slide-clicker and then I put my hands together.'

The first few rows, I think, could obviously tell it wasn't him, but most others didn't know at all. And there was this growing ripple of laughter throughout the auditorium when people got what was happening.I honestly had {{had no idea what to}} expect: I thought the whole thing might be an ambush—that he’d get me to his event and that what he said we were going to do in fact wasn’t what we were going to do, and I would somehow be humiliated. But he stayed on script and was very kind to me. —Noah Wyle ...|$|E

Evans' titles for Fawcett included the When Worlds Collide film adaptation and the Captain Video television adaptation, plus horror stories for Strange Suspense Stories, This Magazine Is Haunted, and Worlds of Fear. He contributed to the company's westerns and romance titles as well. Until the end of his life, Evans believed his work for Fawcett was better than any other in his career. He liked the people there and assembled a team of inkers and assistants after becoming one of Fawcett's top illustrators in 1950.|$|E

[...] Jacob Bannon Supermachiner originally began as a collection of 4 track recordings by Bannon and Parker, recorded in 1994, just prior to Bannon moving to Boston to attend college. The project remained nameless and dormant for a number of years. With the help and inspiration of his good friend Parker, they casually brought the project back to life in the winter of 1998. With his input, they developed collective song ideas into the Rise of the Great Machine album. Bannon structured the lyrical content around his feelings on the rise of technology and the death of the individual, making the project thematic in its content. They entered GodCity Studios with Kurt Ballou in the winter of 1999 to take on the piles of old four track tapes they had. Ballou contributed a great deal to the album material both as an engineer and musician and both Ballou and the band brought something to the table. After the recording was complete, there was little/no time to carry on with the project. The original Rise of the Great Machine CD was released by the Undecided label in 2000 (now out of print). After the album was released future projects were planned but never materialized. However Bannon continued to write music that was sonically different than Converge, which was later released as solo martial many years later.|$|E
