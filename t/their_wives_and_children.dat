Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> with them. The pensioner guards were expected to help deal with any incidents of unrest at the prison.|$|E

Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

25|$|A {{critical}} part of the initiation of any sort of collective identity for African-born slaves began with relationships formed on slave ships crossing the middle passage. Shipmates called each other malungos, and this relationship was considered as important and valuable as the relationship with <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> Malungos were often ethnically related as well, for slaves shipped on the same boat were usually from similar geographical regions of Africa.|$|E

They teach that unrighteous dominion is never acceptable to God, and that with the agency given to men is the expectation that when they marry, they will treat <b>their</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> with love, respect, tenderness, and material and emotional support. LDS leaders teach that men should treat women as equal partners in all decisions in the family.|$|R

The invaders brought <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation.

25|$|The plural {{forms are}} not marked for which {{generation}} is pluralized; thus alimal may either mean (a) {{one man and}} two children or (b) one man, one woman, and one child. These terms are used to address groups, but not single individuals, so for example {{a mother of two}} children would never to referred to or addressed using the term aptil (rather, one would use alamon 'mother'). However, a pastor could address his congregation — a collection of husbands and <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> — as sios alimal 'church alimal' or just alimal.|$|E

25|$|However, war-weariness was a {{major factor}} by 1917, even {{reaching}} the army, as soldiers were reluctant to attack—many threatened to mutiny—saying {{it was best to}} wait for the arrival of millions of Americans. The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the {{officers}} {{know they are}} here only on a temporary basis, further enforced {{by the fact that}} they are disallowed from integrating too much with local society. Due to their chief purpose as a neutral presence here, they are not allowed to marry Singaporean women, hence the allowance to bring <b>their</b> <b>wives</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> from Nepal to the camp. At the end of their contract, they are expected to return to their villages and back to a rural life dependent on agriculture. Only a handful have ever been known to have broken this tradition and chosen to stay in the city-state.|$|E

These prisoners were held primarily at Berg concentration camp in Southern Norway and Falstad concentration camp in central parts of the country; some were held in local jails, while Jewish women were ordered to report in person to their local sheriffs on a daily basis.|$|E
