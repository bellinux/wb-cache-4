5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue.

In order for Paramount <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million.
