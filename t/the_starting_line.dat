5|$|Returning to QPR at {{the start}} of the new season, chances were limited. The 3–1 victory over Leicester City on New Years Day 2008 was Rehman's 50th game in all {{competitions}} since leaving Fulham in 2006. Rehman finished the 2007–08 season in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> for QPR against the Championship's new champions, West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, elite runners were {{warming up}} ahead of <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> on SC 703 when the cannon fired. Grete Waitz's record time was disallowed, {{but she was}} allowed to keep the win, when she was caught ahead of <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> at <b>the</b> cannon.|$|R
5000|$|Port-tack approach: This {{starting}} {{technique was}} created to allow skippers take advantage of 'holes' in <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line.</b> Every short course race starts with a windward leg. Each vessel is wind-powered and vessels to the windward of each other will block the 'clean air.' As a result, many of the racers will group {{on one end of}} <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> trying to outmaneuver each other for clean air. By taking a port-tack approach, the rogue skipper breaks away from the pack and sails down <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> on a port tack. Using a similar timing technique to reaching out and reaching in, the port-tack approach will require your crew to sail back up <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> and cross at the midline as the horn sounds. This will allow you to sail with clean air at a quicker speed to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> race.|$|R
50|$|A P Flag means any boat on {{the course}} side (OCS) of <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> at <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> signal must return, clear <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> and then restart. The I Flag means a boat which is OCS must round either end of <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>line</b> by {{coming back to the}} pre-start side and then {{restarting}} (the 'round the ends' rule). The Z Flag means a boat which is OCS in the minute leading up to <b>the</b> <b>start</b> or at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> itself is given a 20% scoring penalty. The Black Flag means a boat which is OCS in the minute leading up to <b>the</b> <b>start</b> or at <b>the</b> <b>start</b> itself is disqualified.|$|R
5|$|Controversy erupted around Fowler {{after he}} {{reportedly}} refused {{to play against}} the Brisbane Roar on 23 January after being named on the interchange bench for the clash. He however returned to <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up {{for two of the}} last three games of the season. Fowler ended the season collecting a hat-trick of awards at the clubs end-of-season awards night, he was awarded the clubs Player of the Year, Players' Player of the Year and the Golden Boot as top goal scorer.|$|E
5|$|During Tech Homecoming, the Ramblin' Wreck {{has several}} duties. Several days before Homecoming, {{it acts as}} a giant gold starter pistol for the Mini 500 {{tricycle}} race.

On {{the day of the}} Homecoming football game, the Wreck leads the Ramblin' Wreck Parade, then leads the football team onto the field.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line.</b> The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E

5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E
5|$|Three {{shows of}} the band's 24-date {{headlining}} US tour with Moneen, Senses Fail, and The Beautiful Mistake had sold out prior to even having released a single, {{with much of}} the buzz surrounding the band being produced by just word-of-mouth, touring and Internet message boards. Deja Entendus success also earned them tours alongside New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Dashboard Confessional, and Blink-182. The band went on to headline The Bamboozle festival with My Chemical Romance, Alkaline Trio, Thrice, <b>The</b> <b>Starting</b> <b>Line,</b> Fall Out Boy, The Bouncing Souls, Straylight Run and Flogging Molly. They also made their second trip to the UK in 2004, their first as the headline act, the tour completely sold out.|$|E

5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line.</b> In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line,</b> Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line,</b> ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when {{a bad case of}} food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship with a total of five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the bike with oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E
5|$|Bremner was {{appointed}} as Leeds United manager in October 1985, having impressed the boardroom {{with his work}} at Doncaster, particularly his negotiation skills during the sale of Ian Snodin; Leeds paid Doncaster £45,000 in compensation. The club had declined during his absence; Leeds had dropped down into the Second Division, sold Elland Road to the council to raise money, and club supporters picked up a reputation for violence after regular hooligan riots in the stands. He quickly reinstated Don Revie's philosophy and his little traditions, for example he reinstated the sessions of carpet bowls on Friday evenings. Despite this he appointed Ian Snodin as club captain, and dropped former captain and teammate Peter Lorimer from <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>line</b> eleven. He also moved on the young players signed by former manager and teammate Eddie Gray, choosing to sign experienced players in their place. Five key young players to leave the club were Scott Sellars (£20,000 to Blackburn Rovers), Terry Phelan (free transfer to Swansea City), Denis Irwin, Tommy Wright and Andy Linighan (all to Oldham Athletic for £60,000, £55,000 and £80,000 respectively). The money raised allowed him to buy central defender Brendan Ormsby (£65,000 from Aston Villa), and also sign David Rennie, Brian Caswell and Ronnie Robinson. Leeds struggled in the 1985–86 season, but managed to steer away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place.|$|E
