5|$|In March 1991, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Amedo and Dominguez in {{relation}} to the Monbar attack was dropped due to lack of evidence. However, in September 1991, both Amedo and Dominguez were sentenced to 108 years in prison for organising other GAL attacks. In November 1994, Spanish High Court judge Baltasar Garzón reopened <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> them for the Monbar attack.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed to bring <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career {{of support for}} the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
5|$|Flogging was {{discontinued}} in the 1940s, {{with the}} last incident occurring in 1943. From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in solitary confinement, or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were punishable by the cancellation of any remission earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period.|$|E

5|$|My factual {{position}} in the case {{as well as in}} the world of science of today does not permit me to enter <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the Food and Drug Administration, since such action would, in my mind, imply admission of the authority of this special branch of the government to pass judgment on primordial, pre-atomic cosmic orgone energy.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Bangs is {{presented}} {{before a grand}} jury, and Black is afraid that Connie will be too afraid to testify.

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{accepting}} the offer, Apollo is assigned to investigate three separate incidents: a hit-and-run involving Phoenix, the theft of a noodle vendor's cart, and the disappearance of Trucy's favorite pair of panties. At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. By connecting the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Wocky by proving that his fiancée, Alita Tiala, {{was the only one who}} could have committed the crime.|$|E

She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Marsiyem's case concluded, {{the members}} of the White Kijang team were {{assigned}} to other, distant cities. After a final, unsuccessful, plea by Sumaji's council on 5 May 1997 to drop the case, the prosecutor's office appointed Amrin Naim to lead <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Sumaji. On 15 July, after the legislative elections, the office filed charges; the trial began on 29 July, with two members of the three-judge panel that served in the Marsiyem case.|$|E

5|$|Still another, Walter Kwiatkowski, {{testified that}} he paid Horton $600 (in {{addition}} to the $200 bond) to have <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> him dropped where Glasser was acting as prosecutor. And another, Victor Raubunas, {{testified that he}} twice paid bribes to Kretske in cases that Glasser was handling (Raubunas was convicted a third time, after refusing to pay Kretske, in a case prosecuted by Ward himself). Mae and Anthony Jurkas, two small-time bootleggers, testified that Glasser declined to prosecute them {{in exchange for the}} name of their bootlegging boss.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E

Elsewhere, another Millennium Group member, Mike Atkins (Robin Gammell), receives {{a telephone call from}} someone pretending to be Black. Meanwhile, Black suspects that the occult-oriented murder may have been committed to draw the Group, and Black, into the open again.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrest. Strauss-Kahn, who was head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and considered the front-runner in the French presidential election, was accused of sexually assaulting a maid at a midtown Manhattan hotel in May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but quit his IMF post, and his presidential candidacy was sidetracked. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> him weakened as prosecutors said his accuser admitted to lying to a grand jury about events surrounding the attack. Franco Nero portrays a Strauss-Kahn like character, Roberto DiStasio, but he is an Italian dignitary. Ron Rifkin plays DiStasio's defense attorney, who is similar to Strauss-Kahn's real life attorney, Benjamin Brafman.|$|E
5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E

According to article 58-10 Part 2 (anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda) of the Criminal Code of <b>the</b> RSFSR, <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>against</b> all {{defendants were}} dismissed {{for lack of}} evidence.

5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, but the judge stated that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the two accused was not strong. Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to the charges of extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Christian Selmer was impeached on 27 February; {{his cabinet}} members {{followed}} one by one, the last being impeached on 1 April. On 11 March, Selmer resigned. Two acting Prime Ministers {{were drawn from}} his cabinet; Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April. Then, a new cabinet led by Selmer's former Minister of Finance Christian Homann Schweigaard was formed, but in reality it stood no chance of surviving as it faced the Liberal-dominated Parliament, whose means of pressuring the executive branch had been strengthened following the Impeachment trial. In June, as Schweigaard entered his last month as Prime Minister, the King summoned mathematics professor Ole Jacob Broch to form a compromise cabinet, but this failed owing to Conservative opposition, spearheaded by up-and-coming politician Emil Stang. Broch gave up on 22 June, and Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister on 26 June. In light of this change in circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>against</b> Hol had been annulled by Royal Resolution earlier on 6 June.|$|E
