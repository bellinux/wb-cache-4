Trees at moist high altitudes such as Pinus aiwanensis, exist false tree-rings commonly, so the cross-dating is difficult. This paper proposes a solution to a two-step compositive cross-dating by subsection, which is preliminary cross-dating by rings according to dendrology, next measuring the tree-ring width by routine <b>tree-ring</b> <b>climatology</b> to test cross-dating. According to characteristics of Pinus aiwanensis tree-rings, first, draw concentric circles at obvious boundaries to acquire subsections on tree-ring photos and analyze variation of ring from the pith to the east, west, south and north direction in subsection to find false tree-rings, next preliminary cross-dating. This paper establishes the tree-ring width(TRW) and density(TRD) chronologies of Pinus aiwanensis, and analyses correlation between tree-ring index and climate factors such as temperature, precipitation, sunshine hours, etc. The results show that: For Pinus aiwanensis at moist high altitudes exist false tree-rings commonly, two-step cross-dating by subsection is introduced, which is preliminary cross-dating by rings according to dendrology, next measuring the TRW by routine dendroclimatology to test cross-dating and analyze variation of ring in subsection, so that the cross-dating is much accurate and reliable. The correlation between tree-ring components and annual mean temperature shows that: Pinus aiwanensis TRW and TRD have a positive correlation to annual mean temperature and sunshine hours, the tree-ring have a negative correlation to annual mean precipitation and frost days. On adequate moisture conditions, high temperature and sunshine hours {{have a positive effect on}} tree growth, too much rainfall is antiblastic. The TRW have a positive correlation to early spring temperature, the TRD have a significant correlation to summer temperature and sunshine hours. Early spring temperatures and sunshine hours have an effect on Pinus aiwanensis TRW, summer temperature and sunshine hours have a particularly important effect on TRD. In view of the significance level, the TRD have a significant correlation to temperature...|$|E
