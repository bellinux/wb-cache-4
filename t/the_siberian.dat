5|$|The total {{population}} for <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor is uncertain, although {{estimates for the}} small European part of the range vary from 100–500 breeding pairs. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable. For this reason <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN, although as a northern breeding species it may {{in the long term}} be affected by climate change.|$|E

5|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that there are no more than three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu red deer, and Tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian red deer (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E
5000|$|Little Sosva {{is located}} in <b>the</b> West <b>Siberian</b> taiga ecoregion, a region that covers <b>the</b> West <b>Siberian</b> Plain, from <b>the</b> Urals to <b>the</b> Central <b>Siberian</b> Plateau.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor feeds {{mainly on}} insects, {{typically}} picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes and trees, and frequently from near snow fields. Young birds are fed mainly on insects, especially the larvae of beetles, several food items being {{carried to the}} nest at each visit.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor {{was first}} {{described}} by Russian-based German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1776 as Motacilla montanella. The accentors {{were moved to}} their current genus by French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.|$|E
5000|$|The next Saturday, <b>the</b> <b>Siberians</b> hear a radio DJ {{requesting}} them by name {{to come to}} {{the radio}} station. Arriving at the station, the DJ leads the group to a run-down recording studio downstairs.

5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the dunnock is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs {{are also found}} in mountains and spruce taiga. In winter, <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may {{also be found in}} dry grassland and woods.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor has a {{large and}} {{apparently}} stable population. It is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching {{as far as the}} United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Yasak, {{otherwise}} known as Iasak, refers to the fur tax that the natives of Siberia were forced to pay to the tsarist government of Russia. Russians would set up winter camps known as zimovya while they waited for <b>the</b> <b>Siberians</b> to hunt and pay their taxes in fur. In return, <b>the</b> <b>Siberians</b> were promised {{to be able to}} look to the Russian government for protection. If a native tribe, community, or individual did not comply to the tax or otherwise resisted, they would face government-backed Cossack raids.|$|R

5|$|From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk {{companion}} set {{out across}} the frozen sea for <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> tiger was on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{have been}} known to breed with tigers (most often <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> and Bengal tigers) to create hybrids called ligers and tiglons (or tigons). They also have been crossed with leopards to produce leopons. Such hybrid {{breeding}} is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.|$|E

5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E
5|$|The call of <b>the</b> <b>Siberian</b> accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
