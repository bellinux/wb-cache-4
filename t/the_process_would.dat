5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} a lengthy production period, taking {{over a year}} for the casting to be completed and another year and three months for editing. Burshtein, who was doubtful as to how much of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> be completed, took a step-by-step approach, focusing first on the writing, then on accumulating enough funding for the project, followed by the filming and editing. Burshtein became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to direct a film intended for wide distribution. The film premiered at the 69th Venice Film Festival on 1 September 2012 and was later released in the United States on 24 May 2013.|$|E

He would have been eligible for induction as early as 2012, but Yao felt it was too soon and requested that the Hall of Fame delay consideration of the nomination.

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> have to be repeated so more hybrids {{could be used in}} breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|If the bid was rejected, the NPB team {{retained}} {{rights to}} the player. If it was accepted, the successful MLB team was granted the exclusive rights {{to negotiate with the}} player for 30days. If the player and the MLB team agreed on contract terms before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a luxury tax when it exceeds $155million. If the MLB team could not come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the {{rights to the}} player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> be repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the bidding the previous year.|$|E

5|$|By October 1951, the {{estimated}} completion date for Victoriouss modernisation {{was already a}} year past the initial estimate of April 1954. Implacable was scheduled to begin her modernisation in April 1953 for completion in 1956, but the Director of Dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than April 1955 unless the modernisations of two cruisers and the guided missile test ship RFA Girdle Ness were delayed. The Controller of the Navy asked if the time and cost of the reconstruction could be reduced, but the minimum modifications were the most expensive as they involved structural alterations. The Controller ordered the Director of Dockyards to plan for rebuilding Implacable between June 1953 and December 1956 even after the latter protested that even a limited modernisation would require about three-quarters of the structural work of the original plan and that the shortage of skilled workers (already insufficient for Victorious by herself) would delay work on both ships. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of structural work, the requirement to replace the boilers was cancelled and the ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development. In January 1952, the ship's new armament was finalized at six twin-gun 3"/70 mounts and three sextuple Bofors mounts. Five months later the Admiralty decided that Victorious would be the last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> take longer and cost more than was practicable.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that rural communities might obtain fuel from the biochar and synfuel process, which uses agricultural waste to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel and food, instead of the normal food vs. fuel debate.

50|$|With {{straightforward}} Round-robin scheduling, {{every time}} a context switch occurs, a <b>process</b> <b>would</b> need to be swapped in (because only the 10 least recently used processes are swapped in).

25|$|Two {{unprotected}} oil droplets {{with small}} radii in water are favored thermodynamically to coalesce into one bigger droplet because the process yields a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio. The energetic {{contribution of the}} interfacial layer over that same volume of oil is minimized when the two droplets fuse together. Thus, the coalescence process puts the system in a lower energy state and <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> occur spontaneously. However, when the oil droplets are coated with emulsifying agent, electrostatic repulsive force is introduced among the oil droplets which keeps the droplets from coming together.|$|E

25|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Schroeter {{with other}} cavalrymen {{were ordered to}} withdraw. They did so in good order individually and in small groups taking their wounded with them down the dangerous slick slopes under enemy fire.

25|$|Green {{took control}} of the company in 1949 and quickly started {{dismantling}} the railway system, announcing that the company would completely switch to buses by 1958. The system's PCCs were sold to Mexico City (91), Newark NJ (30) and Shaker Heights OH (20). Green sold his shares in 1950 to be briefly replaced by Emil B. Anderson before local lawyer Fred Ossanna ascended to head the company the next year. Ossanna held off on the teardown for a short while, but soon announced that <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> be accelerated. Lines would be removed and replaced by buses in two years.|$|E

25|$|Senefelder had experimented {{during the}} early 19th century with {{multicolor}} lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings. Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by Godefroy Engelmann (France) in 1837 known as chromolithography. A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge {{was to keep the}} images aligned (in register). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.|$|E
25|$|In general, when an {{operation}} {{is applied to}} a general point process the resulting process is usually not a Poisson point process. For example, if a point process, other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> not necessarily be a Poisson point process. However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original point process and the random displacement, {{it has been shown}} via limit theorems that if the points of a point process are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the point process will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson point process.|$|E
25|$|Like France, rosés {{are made}} {{throughout}} Italy with {{the style and}} grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate. The long history of Italian rosés, particularly in the warm {{southern part of the}} country, stem from difficulties {{in the early days of}} winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>would</b> often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual sugar in the remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers realized that if they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.|$|E
