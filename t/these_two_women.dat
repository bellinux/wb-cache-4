5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|Flora and Maria - November 24, 851. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> {{were both}} the {{offspring}} of marriages between a Christian and a Muslim. In addition, Maria was the sister of Walabonsus, who had been executed earlier. Flora's father, who {{died when she was}} very young, was a Muslim, and so her Christianity was legally defined as apostasy. Although Maria and Flora denounced Islam and proclaimed their Christian faith in court together, Maria was executed for blasphemy and Flora for apostasy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Babylonian civilization, around 1200 B.C., two perfumeresses named Tapputi-Belatekallim and -ninu (first half of her name lost) were able to obtain the {{essences}} from plants by using extraction and distillation procedures. If we are to argue chemistry as the use of chemical equipment and processes, then we can identify <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> as the first chemists. Even {{during the time of the}} Egyptian dynasty, women were involved in applied chemistry, such as the making of beer and the preparation of medicinal compounds. A good number of women have been recorded to have made major contributions to alchemy. Many of which lived in Alexandria around the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, where the gnostic tradition led to female contributions being valued. The most famous of the women alchemist, Mary the Jewess, is credited with inventing several chemical instruments, including the double boiler (bain-marie); the improvement or creation of distillation equipment of that time. Such distillation equipment were called kerotakis (simple still) and the tribikos (a complex distillation device).|$|E
500|$|Honora Sneyd and Anna Seward {{lived under}} the same roof for {{thirteen}} years and formed a close friendship which has given rise to much speculation as to its exact nature, located as it was within the tradition of [...] "female friendship", and forming the basis of a body of Anna Seward's poetical works. Various authors differ in their interpretation {{of the relationship between the}} two women, with Lillian Faderman who first suggested that it was lesbian, supported by Barrett although the term relates more to twentieth- rather than eighteenth-century concepts of identity. On the other hand, Teresa Barnard argues against this based more on examination of the correspondence rather than poetry, which is generally based within the lesbian poetic canon, the relationship between <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> being frequently cited.|$|E

500|$|Jill {{is known}} for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning. [...] She is funny and sharp and I love her." ...|$|E
500|$|John Goudas of The Miami News {{noted that}} {{following}} Dickson's return in 1984 following a four-year absence, the soap opera's ratings gained. Goudas praised Dickson, noting that, [...] "Y flourishes when her character takes center stage." [...] Jillian Bowe of Zap2it {{was critical of}} Dickson's portrayal, stating: [...] "When contemplating the four decades of feuding between Genoa City’s grande dame Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and hellcat [...] on The Young and the Restless, cartoon characters don't necessarily spring to mind — okay, maybe during the Brenda Dickson years." [...] Jamey Giddens, also of Zap2it, described her portrayal as [...] "cheesetastic". Head writer Josh Griffith stated that he [...] "adores" [...] Walton, saying that he's [...] "always thought Jill was an integral character to the show". Of Jill's long-standing feud with Katherine, Global TV wrote: [...] "Katherine vs. Jill The ongoing feud between Katherine Chancellor and Jill Foster Abbott sets a record as daytime's longest rivalry. For nearly 27 years, <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> have been constantly {{getting in the way}} of the each other's happiness. Whether it's over men, money, or the custody of a child, Katherine and Jill are always in direct competition." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the draft}} {{followed}} Maguire's idea of retelling {{the story of}} the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation [...] "goes far afield" [...] from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill, [...] "It was [...] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops– and really the whole plot– is different onstage." [...] Schwartz justified [...] the deviation, saying [...] "Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda– who becomes Glinda– and Elphaba...the friendship of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies." [...] In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E
500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E

2500|$|Meier claims his {{extraterrestrial}} encounters {{began in}} 1942, {{at the age}} of five, when he met an elderly Plejaren man named [...] "Sfath". [...] After Sfath's death in 1953, Meier said, he began communicating with an extraterrestrial woman (though not a Plejaren) called [...] "Asket". [...] All contacts ceased in 1964, he said, then resumed on January 28, 1975, when he met [...] "Semjase", the granddaughter of Sfath, and shortly thereafter another Plejaren man called [...] "Ptaah". [...] Other Plejarens, including a woman named [...] "Nera", have since allegedly joined the dialog as well.

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, in the 1920s, fashion-designer Coco Chanel accidentally got sunburnt {{while visiting}} the French Riviera. When she arrived home, she {{arrived with a}} sun tan and her fans {{apparently}} liked the look and started to adopt darker skin tones themselves. Tanned skin became a trend partly because of Coco’s status and the longing for her lifestyle by other members of society. In addition, Parisians {{fell in love with}} Josephine Baker, a “caramel-skinned” singer in Paris, and idolised her dark skin. <b>These</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> were leading figures of the transformation that tanned skin underwent, in which it became perceived as fashionable, healthy, and luxurious.

2500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{feature of this}} relic was that <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> were studying the natural sciences at such an early period. One can only appreciate it by considering the state of “female education” at that time. Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1782, had voted “Not to be at any expense for schooling girls," [...] and as late as 1790, in Gloucester, the town decided that [...] "Females are a tender and interesting branch of the community but have been much neglected {{in the public schools}} of this town." [...] Massachusetts was settled more than 100 years earlier than Vermont, but Vermonters were progressive and firm believers in education. Burlington, in 1810, had four one-room schoolhouses where only the rudiments were taught.|$|E

The safe-deposit box – which, they're told, hadn't been opened in 23 years – {{contains}} a quarto edition of The Tragedy of Arthur – with Shakespeare's name on the title page – dated 1597. They bring the quarto back to Petra and Dana's apartment and pore over it, Petra and Dana excited, Arthur intrigued and skeptical. Arthur quickly concludes that it [...] "was obviously a Shakespeare play because <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> [...] loved so differently each loved it so much the same." [...] In spite of Dana's confidence as to its veracity, Arthur gets in contact with his father, who assures him of its authenticity, and instructs him to confirm it using modern scientific techniques and scholarship. Arthur agrees to follow his father's instructions to publish the play, but remains confused about why his father enlisted his help, rather than Dana's. He notifies his family (back in Prague) {{that he has to}} stay in Minneapolis in order to complete this project.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Native Speakers, Cotera {{argues that the}} {{significance}} of the co-authorship of this novel has often been ignored, under analyzed, and wrongly criticized. [...] The novel has been criticized and rejected by both Chicana/o scholars and historically white publishers because of the unique collaboration between González and Eimer. [...] This {{played a significant role in}} the failure of getting Caballero published during their lifetimes. [...] González was extremely frustrated by this during her life. [...] There has, however, been a strong counterargument to these rejections that considers the power of <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>women</b> from such different backgrounds speaking out together against [...] "the singularity of patriarchal thinking and its bankrupt formulations of identity and authority". Another fascinating component of this collaboration is that it simultaneously tells the Mexican side of the war and reflects a partnership between a Mexican-American and Anglo-American author. [...] Cotera argues that it is only natural for these women to work together as [...] "the notion of a singular author is a construct of modernity that is inextricably linked ‘to the development of modern capitalism and of intellectual property, to Western rationalism, and to patriarchy’". [...] Caballero works to undo this discourse through collaboration as when you write together [...] "you have to desire the collaborative world under formation more than the unextended ‘yours’ and ‘mine’ of the old power structures".|$|E
