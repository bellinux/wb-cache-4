25|$|In Tulgao or Sumadel, {{you need}} to {{negotiate}} to find a local guide willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Sugo-oc fumarole field. The trek from the village to the fumarole field is steep, difficult, at higher elevation, along carabao (water buffalo) tracks. As of 2008, tourists do not visit Sugo-oc and special arrangements need to be made. There is no western style accommodation in the villages of Tulgao or Sumadel, and no accommodation at all at Sugo-oc. There is a little used foot track from Sumadel to the plateau on the southern flank of Binuluan but requires some months of planning and negotiation and {{a high level of}} fitness.|$|E
25|$|Alight at Ag-agama {{drop-off}} {{to see the}} Sun-ut hot sulfur water spring. Alight at Balatoc drop-off {{and walk}} towards the village of Balatoc to see the Bu-ot fumarole field along the way, and the orange-yellow stained rocks of the Pasil River. At Balatoc, {{you might be able}} to arrange a local guide <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Bum-bag fumarole firld. Most of the walk is on tribal lands or private property. Walk from Balatoc to Bum-bag is only for the fit and takes about 5 hours one way. There are no accommodations near Bum-bag fumarole field although there are some very basic huts at the Bum-bag rice terraces. Bum-bag fields are located on private property and permission is required from the owner.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenge}} of designing Belle and the Beast's costumes paled {{in comparison to}} the difficulty of creating the enchanted objects, a combination of intricate wiring, prosthetics and pyrotechnics. Scale was the most prominent [...] "obstacle" [...] for Hould-Ward's to overcome: [...] "The problem was the presentation of an actor as a life-sized teapot when the characters in the film were so little in comparison". Because the castle's enchanted staff is slowly transforming into objects, shown at various stages of transformation without ever completely becoming the objects themselves, Hould-Ward was required to create several different costumes for each character in order to depict the transformation as the show progresses. Meanwhile, the costume of Lumiere alone was built by a team of forty people, including a creator of the prosthetic candle, hair and Vacuform specialist; the pyrotechnician, man responsible for equipping the costume's pyro unit with butane and man operating the butane tank were each separate people. While transforming animation into real life, Hould-Ward also worked on incorporating the human body each costume, explaining, [...] "I wanted the reality of the real person rather than the fantasy of the object... The essence of my job is to allow my real actors <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> this fantastical place." [...] A system of wired frames was used to help the actors support their characters' heavy garments. Such elaborate costumes had never been designed for a Broadway production before. Cogsworth's costume features a fully functioning clock on his face. Meanwhile, Madame de la Grande Bouche was the production's most expensive costume.|$|E
