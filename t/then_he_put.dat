2500|$|Garriott {{began writing}} {{computer}} games in 1974. His first games were created on and for teletype terminals. The code was stored on paper tape spools {{and the game}} was displayed as an ongoing print-out on the spools of printer paper produced by teletype machines. In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he had his first encounter with Apple computers. Inspired by their video monitors with color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After he created Akalabeth for fun, {{the owner of the}} store convinced Garriott it might sell. [...] Garriott spent US$200 printing copies of a manual and cover sheet that his mother had drawn, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> copies of the game in Ziploc bags to sell at the store. [...] Although Garriott sold fewer than a dozen copies of Akalabeth at the store, one copy made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with him. The game sold over 30,000 copies, and Garriott received $5 for each copy sold. Akalabeth is considered the first published Computer Role Playing Game. In the fall, Garriott entered the University of Texas at Austin, joined the school's fencing team and later joined the Society for Creative Anachronism. [...] He created Ultima I while at the university. [...] It was published by California Pacific Computers and sold in Ziploc plastic bags, as was common in those days.|$|E
