5|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.) and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The <b>total</b> <b>biomass</b> of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons).

40|$|Variation of <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> among {{types of}} tree stands has {{previously}} been attributed to {{the characteristics of the}} stand layers. The effects of the understory vegetation on <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> are less well studied. We examined the variation of <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> in subtropical tree stands at two sites of Datian and Huitong in China. The two sites have similar humid monsoon climate but different soil organic carbon. One examination compared two categories of basal areas (high vs. low basal area) in stands of single species. A second examination compared single-species and mixed stands with comparable basal areas. Low basal area did not correlate with low <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> in the single-species stands. The increase in seedling density but decrease in stem density for the low basal area stands at Datian and the quite similar stand structures for the basal-area contrast at Huitong helped in the lack of association between basal area and <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> at the two sites, respectively. The mixed stands also did not yield higher <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomasses.</b> In addition to the lack of niche complementarity between tree species, the differences in stem and seedling densities and the belowground competition between the tree and non-tree species also contributed to the similarity of the <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomasses</b> in the mixed and single-species stands. Across stand types, the more fertile site Datian yielded higher tree, non-tree and <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomasses</b> than Huitong. However, the contribution of non-tree fine-root <b>biomass</b> to the <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> was higher at Huitong (29. 4 %) than that at Datian (16. 7 %). This study suggests that the variation of <b>total</b> fine-root <b>biomass</b> across stand types not only was associated with the characteristics of trees, but also may be highly dependent on the understory layer...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microorganisms}} in post‐fire soil {{on the growth}} of lasthenia californica was studied by comparing growth in natural soil versus autoclaved soil. It was hypothesized that the seeds from the natural soil would have more growth because the microorganisms have a symbiotic relationship with the plants. Seeds were grown in similar conditions in both autoclaved and natural soil. After 44 days, the plants were uprooted and split into shoots and roots. Shoots and roots were then biomassed. The natural soil had a <b>total</b> shoot <b>biomass</b> of 3. 031 g and a <b>total</b> root <b>biomass</b> of 89. 554 g, while the autoclaved soil had a <b>total</b> shoot <b>biomass</b> of 1. 731 g and a <b>total</b> root <b>biomass</b> of 21. 4492 g.

40|$|Allometric {{equations}} for {{the estimation}} of tree volume and aboveground biomass in a tropical humid forest were developed based on direct measurements of 19 individuals of seven tree species in Northern Costa Rica. The volume and the biomass of the stems represented {{about two-thirds of the}} total volume and <b>total</b> aboveground <b>biomass,</b> respectively. The average stem volume varied between 4 and 11 Mg/tree and the average <b>total</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> ranged from 4 to 10 mg/tree. The mean specific gravity of the sampled trees was 0. 62 ± 0. 06 (g/cm 3). The average biomass expansion factor was 1. 6 ± 0. 2. The best-fit equations for stem and total volume were of logarithmic form, with diameter at breast height (R 2 = 0. 66 - 0. 81) as an independent variable. The best-fit equations for <b>total</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> that were based on combinations of diameter at breast height, and total and commercial height as independent variables had R 2 values between 0. 77 and 0. 87. Models recommended for estimating <b>total</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> are based on diameter at breast height, because the simplicity of these models is advantageous.

25|$|Krill are {{considered}} an important trophic level connection – {{near the bottom}} of the food chain – because they feed on phytoplankton and (to a lesser extent) zooplankton, converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for which krill make up the largest part of their diets. In the Southern Ocean, one species, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, makes up an estimated biomass of around 379,000,000 tonnes, making it among the species with the largest <b>total</b> <b>biomass.</b> Of this, over half is eaten by whales, seals, penguins, squid, and fish each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, thus providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from the vegetative phase to a reproductive phase involves {{a dramatic change in}} the plant’s vital cycle, perhaps the most important one, as the process must be carried out correctly in order to guarantee that the plant produces descendents. This transition is characterised by the induction and development of the meristem of the inflorescence, which will produce a collection of flowers or one flower, where only one is produced. This morphogenetic change contains both endogenous and exogenous elements: For example, in order for the change to be initiated the plant must have a certain number of leaves and contain a certain level of <b>total</b> <b>biomass.</b> Certain environmental conditions are also required such as a characteristic photoperiod. Plant hormones play an important part in the process, with the gibberellins having a particularly important role.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} function {{is essentially a}} measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product.

In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass {{objective function}}. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some biotechnologically relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a chemostat or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in the growth response to temperature is a basis for developing adaptation measures to global warming, but evaluation of cultivars for the temperature responses may depend on other environmental factors such as light.

25|$|One of Persinger's lifelong endeavors {{has been}} to {{establish}} a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations. The Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) developed by Persinger and John S. Derr predicted that luminous phenomena and associated physical effects were produced by manifestations of tectonic strain that often precedes by weeks to months seismic events within the region. Persinger argues that the labeling of these manifestations such as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) {{has changed over the}} centuries and reflects the characteristics of the culture. The support for the theory was primarily correlational. The temporal contiguity of reports of unidentified luminous phenomena preceding local seismicity due to injections of fluids was considered a quasi-experimental support for the hypothesis. Alternative models, developed by Persinger and David Vares, were quantified for interaction between quantum values and specific magnitude earthquakes, global climate variations, interactions with population densities, discrete energies as mediators of disease, and processes by which human cognition could be covertly affected by Schumann Resonances and geomagnetic activity. The hypothesis was recently criticized by a prominent blogger.
