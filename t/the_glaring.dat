In Karachi, revolt broke out on board the Royal Indian Navy ship, HMIS Hindustan off Manora Island. The ship, as well as shore establishments were taken over by mutineers. Later, it spread to the HMIS Bahadur. A naval central strike committee was formed on 19 February 1946, led by M. S. Khan and Madan Singh. The next day, ratings from Castle and Fort Barracks in Bombay, joined in the revolt when rumours (which were untrue) spread that HMIS Talwars ratings had been fired upon.|$|E

25|$|The authors did try {{to verify}} Maha Yazawin's dates which {{did not agree with}} those given in Zatadawbon Yazawin. Maha Yazawin's dates for Pagan Dynasty were off by as much as 42 years from Zata (for the {{accession}} date of Anawrahta). Earlier historians had already tried to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>glaring</b> differences between the two prior chronicles. In 1798, Yazawin Thit tried to bridge the gap; its dates are about 15 more years closer to Zata's dates but still 27 years off.

The authors of Hmannan chose to stay with Yazawin Thit's dates for the most part with just a few minor tweaks as seen in the table below.

25|$|Despite this, the Soviet corps {{equipped}} {{with these new}} tanks lost most of them within weeks. The combat statistics for 1941 show that the Soviets lost an average of over seven tanks for every German tank lost. The Soviets lost a total of 20,500 tanks in 1941 (approximately 2,300 of them T-34s, as well as over 900 heavy tanks, mostly KVs). The destruction of the Soviet tank force was accomplished not only by <b>the</b> <b>glaring</b> disparity in the tactical and operational skills of the opponents, {{but also by the}} mechanical defects that affected the Soviet armour pool. Beside the poor state of older tanks, the new T-34s and KVs suffered from initial mechanical and design problems, particularly with regard to clutches and transmissions. Mechanical breakdowns accounted for at least 50 percent of the tank losses in the summer fighting, and recovery or repair equipment was not to be found. The shortage of repair equipment and recovery vehicles led the early T-34 crews to enter combat carrying a spare transmission on the engine deck.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the background luminance on discomfort glare in relation to the size of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source. An experiment was conducted with observers. In the experiment, the change in <b>the</b> discomfort <b>glare,</b> depending on <b>the</b> change in the background luminance, was measured using different sizes of glare sources. Seven sizes of steradian of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source were selected and five levels of back-ground luminance were chosen for the experiment. The results showed that the higher the background lumi-nance, the smaller the observer’s degree of discomfort <b>glare.</b> <b>The</b> exponent of background luminance changed clearly into different patterns in relation to the sizes of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source. A new mathematical formula has been developed by this study to determine the exponent of the background luminance for use in the range from 0. 0003 to 5 sr of <b>the</b> <b>glare</b> source. <b>The</b> use of this formula would extend the application limit of <b>the</b> current unified <b>glare</b> rating formula from the current limit of 0. 1 to 5 sr.

2500|$|Collusion was practiced {{among various}} Champagne houses {{in order to}} drive down the prices of grapes to as a low as they would go, with the ever-present threat that if the houses could not get their grapes for cheap enough they would {{continue}} to source grapes from outside the region. Champenois vineyard owners {{found themselves in a}} situation where they were being paid less for fewer grapes. Poverty was widespread. In January 1911, frustrations reached their boiling point as riots erupted in the towns of Damery and Hautvilliers. Champenois vine growers intercepted trucks with grapes from the Loire Valley and pushed them into the Marne river. They then descended upon the warehouses of producers known to produce faux Champagne, tossing more wine and barrels into the Marne. The French Government tried to answer the vine growers' concerns by passing legislation defining where Champagne wine was to come from. This early legislation dictated that the Marne department and a few villages from the Aisne department were the only areas approved to grow grapes for Champagne production. <b>The</b> <b>glaring</b> exclusion of the Aube region, where the historic capital of Champagne—Troyes—is located, promoted further discontent as the Aubois protested the decision. The Aube, located south of the Marne, was closer to the Burgundy region in terms of soil and location. The growers of the Marne viewed the region as [...] "foreign" [...] and not capable of producing true Champagne but the Aubois viewed themselves as Champenois and clung to their historical roots. The government eventually reversed themselves and included the Aube-much to the dismay of vine growers in the Marne who vigorously protested the decision. More riots erupted and the region was on the brink of civil war. As the government fumbled for an answer that would appease both parties, World War I erupted and those issues had to be set aside as the entire country braced itself for war.|$|E
