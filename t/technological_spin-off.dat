40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{simulation}} study of multiple research and development projects that are worked on concurrently and sequentially {{by more than one}} research team. The technique employed in the modeling and simulation effort was GERT, which was used because of its capability to incorporate the probabilistic outcomes and feedback loops common to R&D projects. The GERT (Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique) includes the modeling of systems in network form and analysis through simulation. It is an important example of <b>technological</b> <b>spin-off</b> from space science research. GERT provides the capability to model and analyze networks of a very general form. Some of the features included in GERT networking are probabilistic branching (stochastic models), network looping (feedback loops), multiple sink nodes (multiple outcomes), multiple node realizations (repeat events), and multiple probability distributions (assigned to activity times). GERT networks are typically analyzed using the GERTS IIIZ simulation package, which provides statistics on project times and cost. Results of the simulation included statistical data on individual project duration and cost as well as overall network time and cost. These results were employed to provide management with an evaluation of different model configurations, prepare overall time and cost estimates as inputs to contract negotiations and to plan and schedule manpower, equipment and capital. Sensitivity analysts was employed to determine key stages in the R&D process where changes in success-failing probabilities might reduce network time and cost. Implementation experiences validated the model as satisfactory with the exception of several minor problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Innovation and {{competition}} take place increasingly between Business Models (BM), {{and not just}} among products, processes, and technologies. Therefore, Business Model Innovation (BMI) becomes the key process to unleash value creation for both established and new companies, and, among these latter, particularly for <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs.</b> For their constituent characteristics, it emerges that BMI in <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs</b> appears {{to be related to}} the effective management of the Intellectual Capital (IC). Despite this, current research has paid little attention to decline BMI through the lenses of IC. This study aims to provide a contribution in this direction by investigating how <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs</b> innovate their BM by leveraging their IC dimensions. A review of relevant literature on BMI has been carried out. Then, a case study methodology has been adopted to analyze seven <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs.</b> The analysis highlighted three main trajectories of BMI, defined in terms of the BMI scope and the main exploited IC dimension. The discussion of findings from a research and practical perspective contributes to the debate on BMI, by providing a new interpretative key based on the relevance of the IC dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand how small businesses can innovate through the generation of <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs,</b> identifying motivations, influences and barriers to achieving this phenomenon. Through a qualitative and exploratory study, we analyzed four cases of <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs</b> in Santa Catarina State. We collected data through field observations, historical data and semi-structured interviews. The main reasons found for spin-offs creation were: diversification and to complement the value chain of the parent company and to ensure greater focus for a specific technology. The main barrier was lack of capital. Government initiatives to support the creation of new businesses, coupled with the organizational culture open to entrepreneurship and investment in R&D, contributed to the development of spin-offs analyzed.

In view of these potential applications, a European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team “Geobiology in Space Exploration” was developed to explore these applications, and identify research avenues to be investigated to support this endeavour. Through community workshops, a roadmap was produced, with which to define future research directions via a set of 15 recommendations spanning three key areas: Science, Technology, and Community. These roadmap recommendations identify the need for research into: (1) New terrestrial space-analogue environments; (2) Community level microbial-mineral interactions; (3) Response of biofilms to the space environment; (4) Enzymatic and biochemical mineral interaction; (5) Technical refinement of instrumentation for space-based microbiology experiments, including precursor flight tests; (6) Integration of existing ground-based planetary simulation facilities; (7) Integration of fieldsite biogeography with laboratory- and field-based research; (8) Modification of existing planetary instruments for new geobiological investigations; (9) Development of in situ sample preparation techniques; (10) Miniaturisation of existing analytical methods, such as DNA sequencing technology; (11) New sensor technology to analyse chemical interaction in small volume samples; (12) Development of reusable Lunar and Near Earth Object experimental platforms; (13) Utility of Earth-based research to enable the realistic pursuit of extraterrestrial biosignatures; (14) Terrestrial benefits and <b>technological</b> <b>spin-off</b> from existing and future space-based geobiology investigations; and (15) New communication avenues between space agencies and terrestrial research organisations to enable this impact to be developed...|$|E
40|$|The use of synchrotrons for pulsed neutron {{spallation}} {{sources is}} an example of scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>spin-off</b> from the accelerator development for particle physics. Accelerator-driven sources provide an alternative to the continuous-flux, nuclear reactors that currently furnish the majority of neutrons for research and development. Although the present demand for neutrons can be adequately met by the existing reactors, this situation is unlikely to continue due to the increasing severity of safety regulations and the declared policies of many countries to close down their reactors within the next decade or so. Since the demand for neutrons as a research tool is, in any case,expected to grow, there has been a corresponding interest in sources that are synchrotron-driven or linac-driven with a pulse compression ring and currently several design studies are being made. These accelerator-driven sources also have the advantage of a time structure with a high peak neutron flux. The basic requirement is for a fast-cycling, medium-energy, high-intensity accelerator complex. In the synchrotron-driven sources, the synchrotrons typically work at the limit of the technology used in their design and require sophisticated injection and "painting" systems, RF cages in ceramic vacuum chambers, large resonant power converters and powerful RF systems. Radiation management {{is one of the main}} concerns. The activation of the exhaust air and ground water must be kept below limits agreed with licensing authorities and where possible the activation of machine elements should be kept within the limits for "hands-on-maintenance". The degradation of materials such as the coil insulation needs to be estimated and radiation-hard elements used in critical places. These requirements imply tight tolerances and high efficiencies for the collimator systems, the ventilation system, the shielding and the parameters of the incoming linac beam. Presently operating neutron sources and newly-proposed sources are listed with their main parameters after the discussion of the above points...|$|E

Este trabalho analisa a possibilidade de ocorrência desses dois eventos a partir da sistematização de informações secundárias de natureza acadêmica, oficial e jornalística. Esse trabalho estuda a possibilidade de ocorrência desses benefícios econômicos e tecnológicos, a partir da almejada transferência de tecnologia, que tornaria factível a ocorrência de {{spin-offs}} do setor militar para o setor civil. O fio condutor da discussão tem por base a compreensão do processo de transferência de tecnologia a países menos desenvolvidos e do fenômeno spin-off em uma economia como a brasileira, com aspectos bastante distintos daquelas onde se supõe que ele ocorra. Desse modo, o trabalho se estrutura em quatro etapas: na primeira são analisadas as concepções de segurança e defesa que se desenvolvem no país, e sua relação com o programa FX- 2. Na segunda etapa se sintetiza o argumento de autores que evidenciam a complexidade da transferência de tecnologia a países menos desenvolvidos, principalmente às relacionadas com a área militar. Em terceiro lugar, será estudada a evolução e o desenvolvimento do conceito de spin-off a partir das particularidades da estruturação do Complexomilitar- industrial dos EUA. Por fim, a quarta parte discute a possibilidade de ocorrência do spin-off na estrutura produtivo-industrial brasileira em função da implementação do ProgramaThe Program FX- 2, {{which aims}} the renew of the Brazilian's aircraft fleet, and {{the transfer of}} technology to local enterprises, have been presented as capable to generate two collateral effects: based on these transfers, enhance these companies {{in order to produce}} and exchange aircrafts; and the economical and <b>technological</b> <b>spin-off</b> of this enhancement to the civil sector. From the systematization of academic, official and journalistic natured secondary information, this work seeks to analyze the possibility of occurrence of these two events, which, might be responsible to the occurrence of spin-offs from military to the civilian economy. The main line of the discussion attempts to comprehend the process of technology transfer to less developed countries, and the phenomenon of spin-off on a economy such as the Brazilian one - characterized by extreme distinct aspects from those where is supposed the event could be observed. Though, the work is structured in four phases: In the first one, it will be analyzed the conceptions of security and defense developed in Brazil, and its relation to the Program FX- 2; Afterwards, in the second phase it will be summarized the arguments of authors who attempt to comprehend the complexity of the technology transfer - mainly those related to military technologies - to less developed countries. In the third phase, it will be studied the evolution and the development of the concept of spin-off, based on the particularities of the structuring of the US's Militaryindustrial- complex.

Nevertheless, they fail to combine their insights into a general system-level understanding. In order to fill this gap the concept of collaborative public space (CPS) is defined. It is then used to analyze the Israeli military's role within the Israeli IT industry, employing the case study method to analyze a specific section of the military—MAMRAM—the main programming, software engineering, and computer users training unit. The paper's main findings are that, contrary to the commonly argued view, which sees the military mainly as a supplier of factors of production such as high skilled labor, or <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs,</b> the military has been playing a critical role in the continuing success of the high-tech industry by providing it with a CPS.

40|$|In today's {{knowledge-based}} society academic spin-offs {{are considered}} as one important form of technology transfer. However, most related entrepreneurial efforts fail. When looking at determining factors, researchers have {{to be regarded as}} members of a complex social network consisting not only of academic peers but also of participants from industry, policy, and supporting institutions, and friends and family members. This network is the academic entrepreneur's general framework of operation characterized by resource and communication flows of differing nature. The thesis tries to answer the question under what conditions <b>technological</b> <b>spin-offs</b> emerge from the academic community with special emphasis on the entrepreneurs' social capital expressed in terms of their social networks. Thus, a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the social network academic entrepreneurs operate in at the different stages of the spin-off process is effected. By means of social network analysis effected by a survey among Austrian academic entrepreneurs, it is examined which network structures favor the recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities and their realization {{in the form of a}} spin-off company. Thus generated insights are intended to contribute to nascent academic entrepreneurs' awareness how to optimally use their social contacts and networks in setting up their new ventures. Moreover, the work intends to provide valuable insights for political decision-makers as to the provision of necessary framework conditions supporting respective social dynamics required for the creation of innovative knowledge- und technology-intensive companies in Austria.

40|$|We {{contribute}} to the literature on corporate spin-offs and university spin-offs by exploring how different characteristics in the technological knowledge base at start-up influence spin-off performance. We investigate how the technological knowledge characteristics endowed at start-up predict growth, taking into account whether the knowledge / technology is transferred from a corporation or university. We use a novel, hand-collected dataset involving 48 corporate and 73 university spin-offs, comprising the population of spin-offs in Flanders during 1991 - 2002. We find corporate spin-offs grow most if they start with a specific narrow-focused technology sufficiently distinct from the technical knowledge base of the parent company and which is tacit. University spin-offs benefit from a broad technology which is transferred to the spin-off.

40|$|While past {{visions of}} future cities were often {{inspired}} by space and {{exploration of the}} unknown, and thus based in science fiction, we propose future visions of the city based in science fact; that which is known and learned from our accumulated space exploration experience. <b>Technological</b> <b>spin-offs</b> from space design could integrate into our daily lives, but the confined conditions of extraterrestrial shuttles seldom serve as Earthly inspiration. If Earth were a spaceship and we were the Astronauts, how would we live differently? What if living conditions in outer space informed and exchanged the cramped social environments down below, such as the worker-housing and informal settlements in our mega-cities? How can space systems inform the structure and workings of extreme urban environments? We are exploring the City as a Spaceship and the reciprocities it offers by mapping extraterrestrial experiences onto earthly settings. Half the world's 7. 25 billion inhabitants (Population Clock at 11. 41 GMT on 15 / 08 / 2014) live in urban settings. Sao Paolo, Tokyo, Mexico City, Mumbai, Moscow, New York City, Hong Kong, London are the big cities, the Megatropolises, which all have rapidly growing populations within their densely packed urban centres with equally densely packed peripheries. Living conditions on Earth must change, irrespective of economic or social status, {{so that we can}} equalize opportunity and achieve a better standard of living for all. We propose that the (mega) City and the Spaceship be viewed as parallel and reciprocal case studies to think about contemporary forms of working and personal engagement; compact spaces, multifunctional spaces, public-private spaces, resource management, alternative energy harvesting, waste management, health management and inclusion of nature into our built-up environment. City As A Spaceship (CAAS) inspires technological humane innovation by positing the spaceship as an analogy of the modern, densely built urban space, with its complex structures and technologically advanced infrastructure, where the designed intention is to configure all systems to eco-efficiency to optimize the use of available resources. We believe the time is now to meet our primary needs through CAAS architecture and design, using technologies for space that can immediately impact the humane retrofitting of these cities. The CAAS City can be an inspiration, an alternate view, for a future city and a way to project and achieve our dreams and visions of an equitable and environment-friendly urban life...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} origin from universities, {{academic}} spin‐offs operate {{at the forefront}} of the <b>technological</b> development. Therefore, <b>spin‐offs</b> exhibit a skill‐biased labour demand, i. e. spin‐offs have a high demand for employees with cutting edge knowledge and technical skills. In order to accommodate this demand, spin‐offs may have to pay a relative wage premium compared to other high‐tech start‐ups. However, neither a comprehensive theoretical assessment nor the empirical literature on wages in start‐ups unambiguously predicts the existence and the direction of wage differentials between spin‐offs and non‐spin‐offs. This paper addresses this research gap and examines empirically whether or not spin‐offs pay their employees a wage premium. Using a unique linked employer‐employee data set of German high‐tech start‐ups, we estimate Mincer‐type wage regressions applying the Hausman‐Taylor panel estimator. Our results show that spin‐offs do not pay a wage premium in general. However, a notable exception from this general result is that spin‐offs that commercialise new scientific results or methods provide higher wages to employees with linkages to the university sector – either as university graduates or as student workers. ...|$|R
