During initial {{training}} at HMS Collingwood, near Portsmouth, Clark discovered that he was colour blind and only passed the medical examination by persuading <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> behind him to whisper the answers to him. Clark served aboard HMS Fleetwood on convoy escort operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean before attending HMS King Alfred at Hove. Whilst there his colour blindness was discovered and he was banned from seagoing postings.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} numerous supporting roles from British actors. For {{her role}} as Andrea Waltham, Saunders [...] "heard Joan Collins' voice in [...] head". Her Absolutely Fabulous co-star June Whitfield appeared in cameo as the housekeeper. Felicity, the bridesmaid who Joey entices, is played by Olivia Williams. Further cameos were made by Sarah Ferguson as herself, Richard Branson as the vendor who sells Joey a hat, and Hugh Laurie as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> next to Rachel on the plane. Lisa Kudrow did not join the others in London as she was too heavily pregnant to fly, like her character Phoebe. Elliott Gould inadvertently revealed {{to the public that}} Rachel was to turn up at the wedding, upsetting Marta Kauffman.|$|E
2500|$|The motion also {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> next to Grant also {{told police he}} heard Mehserle say [...] "I'm going to taze him." ...|$|E

60|$|Thacher {{turned a}} little, nodding to <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> at <b>the</b> bar. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> rose at once, coming toward the table.|$|R

2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only what I {{have done}} too," [...] she answered. [...] "I, too, am married, Harold, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> there below, John Croyden, is my husband." ...|$|E
60|$|Lingard's eyes, {{that had}} been fixed aloft, {{glanced down at the}} dejected figure of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on the skylight. He seemed to {{hesitate}} for a minute.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hennibul, {{who was one}} of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> round, doubled his copy of Verity up {{and beat}} the air with it.|$|R
60|$|Harry moved away, but {{presently}} {{came back}} to announce that the meal was ready. When it was over the boys strolled off toward the reef, leaving <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> smoking on <b>the</b> beach.|$|R
60|$|Although {{they did}} not know it, the Rovers had no sooner {{disappeared}} upstairs than two of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> on <b>the</b> veranda of the hotel came into the office and looked over the register.|$|R
6000|$|... "Physically I am {{no match}} for you," [...] he said slowly, his black gaze fixed upon <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> {{on the end of}} the bed. [...] "You could spring--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's not {{got a bad}} cut," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on the log. [...] "He'll come to arter a spell, go back to ther fort, an' give an alarm." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on {{the wall}} {{appreciated}} the compliment to his sex, and proved that he deserved his share of it by taking it exactly as she meant it, and saying heartily: ...|$|E

60|$|Father and son swung round together: <b>the</b> old <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> as erect as the younger.|$|R
60|$|Hetty drubbed {{with her}} little foot, and looked at <b>the</b> young <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> before her--strong, idle, melancholy.|$|R
60|$|It quite {{shocked me}} to hear it, for I had already {{recalled}} with anything but a serious association the image of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on the sofa that night wiping his head.|$|E
60|$|And who is <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on the chest, {{with the}} cord in his hand, looking out idly at the sea? The {{man is the}} only cheerful person in the ship's company. In other words--John Want.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found him}} a {{pleasant}} and very well informed man, Ralph, and enjoyed my {{talk with him}} just as you enjoyed talking nonsense to his daughters and listening to their songs. Who was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> next to the eldest daughter?" ...|$|E
60|$|The Scarecrow went in {{and found}} <b>the</b> little <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> down by <b>the</b> window, engaged in deep thought.|$|R
60|$|Sam found <b>the</b> old <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> {{by a small}} table, {{eating a}} frugal meal of beans and bread and coffee.|$|R
60|$|She {{caught at}} {{his arm in}} terror. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> was <b>sitting</b> at <b>the</b> next table.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Blow it out--hard--that's it! Well now, sir, do {{you come}} and begin upon mine, as you must be hungry. I'll finish the griddling. Ought we to mind <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> down in our company, as there's no other room for him? I hear him coming in.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They all, it seems, have {{confidence}} in me," [...] thought Razumov dully. He had an indulgent contempt for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> {{shoulder to shoulder with}} him in the confined space. Probably he was afraid of scenes with his wife. She was said to be proud and violent.|$|E
6000|$|... "''Ow did I come 'ere?' {{retorted}} <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>sitting</b> up {{and speaking}} {{in a tone of}} bitter, but not unnatural, indignation. 'Why, {{in the course of my}} dooty, that's 'ow I come 'ere. I see a burglar getting in through the window, so I just follows and slips in after 'im.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons," [...] said Little Toomai, and all <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> about {{broke into}} a roar of laughter. Most of them had taught their {{elephants}} that trick when they were boys. Little Toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air, and he wished very much that he were eight feet underground.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why do {{you come}} here to do this?' said <b>the</b> old <b>man,</b> <b>sitting</b> down beside them, {{and looking at the}} figures with extreme delight.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the sailors}} had a {{wound in the}} cheek, the ball in its passage {{carrying}} off part of the ear. One of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> in <b>the</b> bow had a broken arm, but {{only one of the}} others was seriously hurt. Frank went on deck again as soon as his shoulder was bandaged and his left arm strapped tightly to his side.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on {{the long}} iron bench was also gazing placidly out to sea. Now he was once more in repose. Flambeau felt quite certain {{that one of his}} eyes was {{naturally}} larger than the other. Both were now well opened, and he could almost fancy the left eye grew larger as he gazed.|$|E
60|$|The French {{hunter and}} trapper was a rapid walker, and Tadwin did not {{catch sight of}} the fellow for two hours after {{starting}} on the trail. Then he located <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> on a slight knoll, resting. He at once halted and kept his position until the Frenchman moved again, when he followed as before.|$|E
60|$|On {{the near}} side sat a swarthy young gentleman unknown {{to either of}} the ladies. He was smiling as he spoke to his companion. A moment later and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>sitting</b> beyond came into view. He was not smiling. His face was white and set, {{and it was the}} face of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.|$|E
50|$|In May the war ended, with <b>the</b> <b>men</b> still <b>sitting</b> behind <b>the</b> barbed wire, the war {{passed them}} by.|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace, fool! {{and speak}} not of thy lady mistress," [...] thundered <b>the</b> old <b>man,</b> <b>sitting</b> upright. [...] "Begone to the stables. Dost thou hear me? Go!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{extinguished}} the lamp, {{and they}} gathered round the cooking pot, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>sitting</b> on <b>the</b> earth {{floor with the}} red glow of the burning charcoal on their faces. It could not be seen many yards away, and Grahame's view commanded {{the path to the}} door. Blanca divided the omelette she had made, and afterward gave them some black coffee and a bundle of cigarettes.|$|R
