5|$|It's About Games {{bought and}} sold used PC games, video games, and board games. Winmark spent roughly $6.8 million to acquire Video Game Exchange Inc. in 1997 and renamed it to It's About Games. It's About Games {{locations}} were largely in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland. It made money for Winmark until 1998. During its last year under Winmark management, It's About Games lost $3.4 million because of excessive inventory, a buggy computer system, poorly chosen products, and poorly trained employees. Winmark owned 60 of the 64 It's About Games stores in the franchise {{and would have been}} profitable without It's About Games. Winmark sold or closed all its It's About Games stores in 1999 to reduce losses. Winmark also aimed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of stores it owned because it wanted to focus on franchisee-owned stores.|$|E

The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting was odd.|$|E

The last trains ran in February 1957, and in April CN purchased the railway track and proceeded to demolish it. Although some segments in Cornwall and Ottawa were retained, the line through Embrun was scrapped. A few decades later, the municipal government constructed a rail trail on the right of way, which remains in use to the present day.|$|E

500|$|Hancock was Peter Berg's {{first film}} with visual effects as {{critical}} cinematic elements. He considered the computer-generated fight his least {{favorite part of}} the film, citing limited control in making the scene successful. According to the director, [...] "Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're at the mercy of your effects guys... unless they're really technically oriented... it's definitely the time we have the least amount of control as directors." [...] He and other filmmakers worked <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to Robert Downey, Jr.'s acclaimed portrayal of Tony Stark in the previous May's superhero release, Iron Man.|$|E

Matt Groening developed the lengthy sequence in order <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. As the finished episodes became longer, the production team were reluctant to cut the stories in order to allow for the long title sequence, so shorter versions of it were developed.|$|E

In the first gag, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing {{a message on the}} chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the [...] "chalkboard gag". The other gag is known as a [...] "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television. Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time. The theme, which plays over the sequence, was composed by Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a [...] "retro-style" [...] theme. The piece, which took two days to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.|$|E
500|$|Not {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a Final Fantasy title, the game began from a prototype of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> projects costs. The game {{was linked to the}} Crystal Chronicles story through the game mechanic of summoning objects into existence through thought, a theme of the game series. Later in development empire building and strategy genres influenced the gameplay, but effort was made to simplify that genre's usual high learning curve. [...] Many features did not make it into the final game, including a [...] "freeplay" [...] mode with randomly generated dungeons every game, and an epilogue, which was removed for not fitting in with the finished game. The bakery was going {{to be replaced by a}} general store, but using a bakery was more appealing to the developers. Multiplayer was another feature the director was enthusiastic about, with ideas including a [...] "kings tournament" [...] where players competed against each other, and recruiting adventurers from other kingdoms, but was not included.|$|E

Approximately sixty new entrants, of whom around fifty were expected to graduate, arrived at No.4 SFTS every twenty-eight days. Discipline was strict, the aim being <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> accidents that were typical of service flying training establishments. In the event, the school did not suffer a fatal flying accident for over a year-and-a-half after it commenced operations. In November 1941, eight of its Ansons {{took part in the}} search for survivors from HMAS Sydney. By this time, No.4 SFTS was operating just over a hundred aircraft, including two Fairey Battles and two de Havilland Fox Moths, the remainder being Ansons. Personnel totalled 1,475, including 197 students. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December, the school's aircraft were classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia. Nos.68 and 69 Reserve Squadrons were formed at Geraldton, but they were only used for maritime search-and-rescue, and saw no action before their disbandment in February 1943. On 30September 1942, a No.4 SFTS Anson operated by No.68 Squadron crash-landed in a marsh [...] north of Carnarvon; one crewman was killed and two injured. From October 1942 to March 1944, the school was commanded by World WarI veteran and pioneer civil aviator Norman Brearley.|$|E
