5|$|Latham and Farris {{both made}} their wrestling debuts in 1976 and later {{signed with the}} Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). CWA owners Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler paired Latham and Farris as a new {{incarnation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers. Managed by Sergeant Danny Davis, the Bombers were the promotion's top heel tag team, Their first championship came on June 15, 1979, when they won an infamous match against Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee in Tupelo, Mississippi. After <b>the</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers controversially won the title, Lawler and Dundee attacked the new champions and fought {{with them in the}} concession stands. They soon dropped the belts to Robert Gibson and his real-life brother Ricky, but they regained them in a rematch later that summer. Meanwhile, the Fabulous Freebirds, who had been the region's number two heel tag team became faces and challenged the Bombers for the belts. They won the title from the Latham and Farris in September 1979, but the Bombers won a rematch to reclaim the championship.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers {{is a name}} used {{by several}} tag teams in {{professional}} wrestling. The first team to use the name was the combination of Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson. It was later used by Pat Patterson and Ray Stevens, who began teaming in 1965. Larry Latham and Wayne Farris used the name in the late 1970s in the Continental Wrestling Association and, from 1979 to 1980, Stanley Lane and Bryan St. John competed as the Blonde Bombers while wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida. In the early 2000s, the team of Tank and Chad Toland appeared as <b>the</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers in Ohio Valley Wrestling before changing their team name upon entering World Wrestling Entertainment. Each incarnation held title belts together at least once. Patterson and Stevens were inducted as a team into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{quickly became}} one of the top heel acts in the {{territory}} with their [...] "Hollywood superstar" [...] arrogance and cheating ways. On May 8, 1970, <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> won their first title when they won a tournament to crown new NWA United States Tag Team Champions (Tri State version). Their first run with the title was short as Luke Brown and Danny Hodge defeated them three weeks later, but <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> managed to regain the gold days after being defeated for them. For the rest of 1970, Roberts and Brown dominated the Tri State tag team scene until losing to Bill Watts and Billy Red Lyons in January 1971. In early 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> became three-time NWA United States Tag Team Champions by defeating Dennis Stamp and Bull Bullinski for <b>the</b> titles. <b>The</b> <b>Blonds</b> held on to the titles until sometime April, when they lost the gold to Rip Tyler and Eddie Sullivan before leaving the promotion by mid-1973.|$|R
25|$|As soon as <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> dropped <b>the</b> titles, {{the team}} was again {{temporarily}} split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and jobber tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. <b>The</b> <b>Blonds</b> also confronted <b>The</b> Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. <b>The</b> <b>Blonds</b> last match as a team {{took place on the}} October 30, 1993 episode of Saturday Night. After <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> had defeated a jobber tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker snubbing him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he would put him down. Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> broke up for the third and final time.|$|R

5|$|After {{dropping}} the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship {{for a third}} and final time, <b>the</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win the belts on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained the belts in a rematch against The Jet Set but later dropped them to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. <b>The</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost a match to Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing the belts, Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion. Latham soon left Tennessee {{to compete in the}} World Wrestling Federation, where he held the WWF Tag Team Championship as Spot, a member of The Moondogs.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1979, Eaton turned heel (bad guy) for {{the first}} time in his career by joining Tojo Yamamoto's group of wrestlers, whom the fans hated.

Eaton's heel run did not last long before he rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by <b>The</b> <b>Blond</b> Bombers (Larry Latham and Wayne Ferris) to return to the fan-favorite side once more. After reuniting the team, Eaton and Gulas had one final run with tag team champions and worked an intense feud with Latham and Ferris.|$|E

They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance.

Playing off their image of believing they're the best thing in wrestling, Pillman and Austin started to target Flair and Anderson by mocking them through their own segment called [...] "A Flare for the Old". Austin would stand in the background with a pillow under his shirt for a gut while slowly stroking his chin imitating Arn Anderson. Pillman dressed up in an old bathrobe, put on reading glasses and a grey wig and then cut into Flair for being too old and too scared of <b>the</b> Hollywood <b>Blonds.</b> <b>The</b> impersonation drew Ric Flair back in the ring making his [...] "Big Show" [...] wrestling return at Clash of Champions XXIII, where Flair and Anderson challenged <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> for <b>the</b> tag team titles.

500|$|In May 1976, {{at the age}} of 17, Eaton {{made his}} debut in NWA Mid-America. He entered his first match, a loss to Bearcat Wright, as a last-minute {{substitute}} for Wright's absent opponent. He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship. [...] Gulas decided to [...] "promote" [...] Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event. The angle that really helped elevate Eaton's name up the card in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team <b>The</b> Hollywood <b>Blonds</b> (Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts). Eaton fought <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and [...] "Pistol" [...] Pez Whatley.

25|$|After {{leaving the}} Tri State area, Roberts and Brown next {{popped up in}} Florida working for Eddie Graham’s Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF). After working {{their way up the}} ranks, the duo {{challenged}} for and won the top tag team title in the promotion, the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, from the team of Dick Slater and Stan Vachon in March 1974. <b>The</b> <b>Blonds</b> ruled <b>the</b> tag team division over the summer of 1974 until dropping the gold to Dick Slater and Toru Tanaka in the fall (either September or October). After their run with the titles ended, <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> moved on to another territory, the most natural territory for the team – NWA Hollywood Wrestling in Los Angeles. The Gene and Mike LeBell territory saw Roberts and Brown win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship four times between December 1974 and August 1975, defeating such teams as Victor Rivera and Louie Tillet, Porkchop Cash and S.D. Jones, John Tolos and Louis Tillet, and the promotion's biggest tag-team attraction Black Gorman and Goliath. During their time in Los Angeles, <b>the</b> Hollywood <b>Blonds</b> were also involved in an angle that saw the Los Angeles version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship shift over to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) as their main tag team title of that day. On August 1, 1975, reigning champions Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi fought <b>the</b> Hollywood <b>Blonds</b> to a no contest, after which the titles were declared vacant. A rematch in Nagoya, Japan saw <b>the</b> <b>Blonds</b> win <b>the</b> North American Tag Team titles on September 22. On October 2, Inoki and Sakaguchi regained the titles and they became more or less exclusive to NJPW after that date.|$|R
25|$|After {{joining the}} Detours, Entwistle {{played a major}} role in {{encouraging}} Pete Townshend's budding talent on the guitar, and insisting that Townshend be admitted into the band as well. Eventually, Roger Daltrey fired all the members of his band with the exception of Entwistle, Townshend and the drummer, Doug Sandom, a semi-pro player who was several years older than the others. Roger Daltrey relinquished the role of guitarist to Pete Townshend in 1963, instead becoming frontman and lead singer. The band considered several changes of name, and finally settling on the name the Who while Entwistle was still working as a tax clerk (temporarily performing as the High Numbers for four months in 1964). When the band decided that <b>the</b> <b>blond</b> Roger Daltrey needed to stand out more from the others, Entwistle dyed his naturally light brown hair black, and it remained so until the early 1980s.|$|E
