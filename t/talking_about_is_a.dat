We {{are not talking about}} mere instinctive conformity - it is, after all, a perennial failing of mankind. What we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rationalized conformity - an open, articulate philosophy which holds that group values are not only expedient but right and good as well.|$|E

Irving Janis pioneered the initial research on the groupthink theory.

He formed Selman & Associates in 1976, and [...] "began research {{into the nature of}} culture and large-scale systems change". In 1984, he partnered with Werner Erhard to form Transformational Technologies, a consulting and training franchise operation, which served as the corporate division of Werner Erhard & Associates, with Selman as its first president. In his capacity there, he was noted to have said of his philosophy of management, [...] "when we talk management technology, what we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rigorously tested and challenged body of distinction for having access to whatever the phenomenon of management really is".|$|E

5000|$|Martin Haspelmath {{agrees with}} {{four of these}} points, but not the point about {{language}} change. He disagrees because any account of a language requires identifying it, and we can easily identify different stages of a language. He suggests that linguists may prefer to use a codification that is made at the [...] level since [...] "it rarely matters to linguists whether what they are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> language, a dialect or a close-knit family of languages." [...] He also questions whether an ISO standard for language identification is appropriate since ISO is an industrial organization, while he views language documentation and nomenclature as a scientific endeavor. He cites the original need for standardized language identifiers as having been [...] "the economic significance of translation and software localization," [...] for which purposes the ISO 639-1 and 639-2 standards were established. But he raises doubts about industry need for the comprehensive coverage provided by ISO 639-3, including as it does [...] "little-known languages of small communities that are never or hardly used in writing and that are often in danger of extinction".|$|E
5000|$|While doing {{business}} with some men, Viper is told by a Hydra agent that they have apprehended Black Widow. This {{is part of a}} diversion so that the Champions can infiltrate the Hydra base. When Viper figures out that Black Widow is planning to kill Captain America, Viper tries to persuade Black Widow to join up with her enterprise. When the Champions find a specific person and doubt that it's the person that they are looking for, Black Widow assures them them that this is the person they are looking for. Travelling together through the woods, [...] "Bucky" [...] and [...] "Sam" [...] are accompanying [...] "Steve Rogers." [...] While on the Underground's transport, Ant-Man sends Stinger the updates on the quests for the Cosmic Cube fragments. As the Tony Stark A.I. speaks with Black Panther, he tells the Tony Stark A.I. that he is remaining neutral as the Tony Stark A.I. states that Hydra will not rest until they have all the Cosmic Cube shards. When Black Panther states that he can have the Tony Stark A.I. give him the Cosmic Cube shards that he has, the Tony Stark A.I. declines and takes his leave. After recapping a fight with the High Evolutionary and breaking into vaults, Ant-Man arrives with the Underground in Madripoor where they are attacked by the Hand that are under the control of Hive. As the Tony Stark A.I. defeats Hive, Gorgon is knocked down by Hercules who turns into stone afterwards due to Gorgon's stare. When the Tony Stark A.I. frees Hydra's prisoner Shang-Chi, he reveals to the Tony Stark A.I. that he doesn't have the Cosmic Cube fragment anymore. A flashback revealed that Emma Frost stole it from an unconscious Shang-Chi. Captain America meets with New Tian's ambassador Beast in the site where Mjolnir is. He claims to Beast that there is a Cosmic Cube in New Tian before being called away. While on a helicopter, Madame Hydra tells Captain America that Scarlet Witch has become unhinged from Chthon's possession, the A.I. Virus made by Arnim Zola is still keeping Vision under control, and Odinson is still praying to Odin about his troubles where it was mentioned that Jane Foster is trapped in an alternate dimension and that she and Doctor Faustus can't subvert him. Back at the Underground, Giant-Man, Rayshaun, and the Tony Stark A.I. confirm that they don't have a Cosmic Cube-tracking device. It is then revealed that Mockingbird is Hydra's inside person as she gives the signal for Hydra Helicarriers to strike. As Arnim Zola mentions that their attacks won't bring down their defenses, Captain America states that they will unleash their secret weapon. Back in the mysterious forest, [...] "Steve Rogers," [...] "Sam," [...] and [...] "Bucky" [...] encounter the Red Skull's clone who plans to take them [...] "home." [...] Back at the Hydra Helicarrier, Arnim Zola tells Captain America that their subject in the vault is awake but disoriented and that the procedure they did on him is temporary as his condition will degrade quickly. After brushing off Arnim Zola's concerns, Captain America states that they need their subject for a short time to bring the Underground down. When the vault opens, it is revealed that the person that they are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> temporarily-revived Bruce Banner.|$|E

40|$|If {{we had to}} {{pick one}} word to {{summarize}} the topic of this conference, the word would be “scrounging. ” Here we have {{a room full of}} economists and what you have been writing and <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set of shifting and contentious and even vanishing sources of financing for higher education in the 21 st century. Alumni, students and parents, the public sector, gifts from many sources, industry collaborations, all and more are in the mix. And more and more, private and public institutions are looking alike in their “scrounging ” behavior. As traditional sources of financing become tighter, public institutions are facing mounting enrollment pressures in the context of state appropriations that are not keeping pace with growth in personal income, and private institutions are mounting generous financial aid packages while hitting some effective ceilings on tuition increases (Ehrenberg, 2000). Meanwhile, both types of institutions are looking to the same sources for new support – fundraising; for-profit educational ventures; internal cost-savings and efficiencies; entrepreneurial activity involving intellectual property and industry-university collaborations. You have been talking about these issues in detail all day, and will talk about them i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{collects}} several notes I've written {{over the}} last year in an attempt to work through my dissatisfactions with the ideas about representation I was taught in school. Among these ideas are the notion of a 'world model'; the notion of representations having 'content' independent of the identity, location, attitudes, or activities of any agent; and the notion that a representation is the sort of thing you might implement with datastructures and pointers. Here I begin developing an alternative view of representation whose prototype is a set of instructions written in English on a sheet of paper you're holding in your hand while pursuing some ordinarily complicated concrete project in the everyday world. Figuring out what the markings on this paper are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fresh problem in every next setting, and solving this problem takes work. Several detailed stories about representation use in everyday activities—such as assembling a sofa from a kit, being taught to fold origami cranes, following stories across pages of a newspaper, filling a photocopier with toner, and keeping count when running laps—illustrate this view. Finally, I address the seeming tension between necessity of interpreting one's representations in every next setting and the idea that everyday life is fundamentally routine.
