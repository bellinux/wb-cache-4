5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a <b>temporary</b> <b>injunction.</b> In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E

Although Yukica was offered standard compensation for the remaining 18 months of his contract, he instead chose to file suit against Leland in New Hampshire Superior Court for breach of contract. Based on various procedural irregularities regarding Yukica's dismissal, Judge Walter Murphy, a former football coach, issued two <b>temporary</b> <b>injunctions</b> against Leland and Dartmouth College. With the case gaining increased press, partly due to testimony at preliminary hearings by coach Joe Paterno of Pennsylvania State University, and college football recruitment already under way, Dartmouth {{settled out of court}} and Yukica went on to coach Dartmouth for another season before resigning.|$|R

Remington Rand officials were particularly concerned that NLRB hearings would expose their anti-union tactics.

25|$|On November 25, 2014, Washoe County, Nevada District Court Judge Scott Freeman, {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction preventing Uber from operating statewide. The <b>temporary</b> <b>injunction</b> {{was based on}} the company's failure to file a certificate of public convenience and necessity, which is required for every transportation service in Nevada to conform with state regulations. The Government of Nevada also claimed that Uber's screening process was not rigorous enough to protect consumers, and failed to conform with the aforementioned regulations. Uber contested the ruling, arguing that it is an app-based technology company rather than a transportation company, but the company's management made the decision to temporarily shut down its Nevada operations.

She said that {{given the nature of}} the charges, the situation was too severe to wait for the legislature to act. The Supreme Court, however, in orders without opinions, denied Madigan leave to file the complaint; it denied the motion for temporary relief, and it denied a motion filed by private citizens led by John Bambenek for leave to file a complaint to remove the governor from office.|$|E

All pre-arrest bails were rejected, <b>temporary</b> <b>injunctions</b> were terminated and permissions of FIRs were granted against PPP-connected persons and senior officers - all jobs accomplished by J Malik Qayyum. He was a nominated judge on Ehtesab Bench of the Lahore High Court. The PPP raised hue and cry in media, labelled J Malik Qayyum as biased, more because his real brother, Pervez Malik, was a sitting MNA from PM Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League. Pervez Malik was given an unopposed seat of the National Assembly vacated by the Prime Minister himself from Lahore.|$|R
