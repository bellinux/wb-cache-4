5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies {{including}} libellulids and aeshnids {{are found}} in desert pools, for example in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> where they are active in shade temperatures between 18 and 45°C (64.4 to 113°F); these insects were able to survive body temperatures above the thermal death point of insects {{of the same species}} found in cooler places.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} US395 in California is {{split into two}} segments, as the highway exits and reenters California via Nevada. The {{southern}} segment crosses <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> and Owens Valley and passes east of the Sierra Nevada. The northern segment also follows the Sierra Nevada and crosses the Modoc Plateau.|$|E
5|$|A private {{prayer service}} {{was held for}} Parsons at the funeral home where his body was cremated. Cameron {{scattered}} his ashes in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> before burning most of his possessions. She later tried to perform astral projection to commune with him. The O.T.O. also held a memorial service—with attendees including Helen and Sara—at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.|$|E

5|$|After cresting both {{mountain}} passes, {{the highway}} descends into the Antelope Valley, a large valley within <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert.</b> The highway crosses Angeles Forest Highway and the California Aqueduct in the descent. Route 14 {{serves as the}} primary north–south thoroughfare for the communities of Palmdale and Lancaster. Between Palmdale Boulevard (County Route N2) and Avenue D in Lancaster, SR 14 runs concurrently with SR 138.|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it was {{probably}} not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> large lakes also formed during that time. In the early Holocene the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.|$|E
5|$|S. t. salicamans occurs {{west of the}} Sierra Nevada range {{during the}} summer and in south and central Baja California Peninsula to <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> and Colorado Desert in winter. In winter, the plumage of both sexes is browner than other {{subspecies}}, and in summer, the male's black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies. This subspecies has been called the willow goldfinch.|$|E

5|$|State Route 247 (SR 247) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California in San Bernardino County. The road passes through <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> {{connecting}} SR 62 in Yucca Valley to Interstate 15 (I-15). SR 247 was designated by the California State Legislature in 1969; the county roads along that route {{were given to the}} state in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is located}} in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it {{is located on the}} Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the {{intersection}} of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateaus, the Great Basin, and <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert.</b> The northern part of the park is known as the Kolob Canyons section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit40.|$|E
5|$|Traversing the {{extremes}} of California, from <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> to the Sierra Nevada, El Camino Sierra has been advertised {{to the world as}} a highway to showcase the natural beauty of California as far back as 1910. Though most of Sierra Highway was bypassed in the early 1970s with freeways, the road is still well known. The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found anywhere else in the world. The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of evolution that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have been built in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert.</b> These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction is a 2007 {{science fiction}} action horror film {{and the third}} {{installment}} in the Resident Evil film series based on the Capcom survival horror video game series Resident Evil. The film follows the heroine Alice, along {{with a group of}} survivors from Raccoon City, as they attempt to travel across <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>desert</b> wilderness to Alaska and escape a zombie apocalypse. The film was directed by Russell Mulcahy and produced by Paul W. S. Anderson.|$|E

5|$|SR 177 {{begins at}} I-10 near Desert Center and briefly travels north, {{intersecting}} with CR R2. At this intersection, SR 177 turns northeast and travels across <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert,</b> through the Chuckwalla Valley. It passes near the Desert Center Airport and comes near Palen Lake, a dry lake. The highway passes along the southeastern boundary of Joshua Tree National Park before turning due north and crossing the desert for several miles. SR 177 briefly turns northeast again before intersecting with SR 62 and defaulting onto SR 62 eastbound.|$|E
5|$|The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550megawatt (MWAC) {{photovoltaic}} {{power station}} approximately six miles north of Desert Center, California, in <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert.</b> It uses approximately 8.8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin-film manufacturer First Solar. As of Fall 2015, the Solar Farm has the same 550MW installed capacity as the Topaz Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California, making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert</b> {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E

50|$|An {{observational}} study of tortoises near St. George, Utah, {{found that the}} tortoises exclusively consume <b>the</b> <b>Mojave</b> <b>Desert’s</b> white stones, which are composed of calcite (mostly calcium carbonate), {{as opposed to the}} brown, grey, or other colored stones. The ingestion of these white stones is attributed to the deliberate intake of additional calcium.|$|R
