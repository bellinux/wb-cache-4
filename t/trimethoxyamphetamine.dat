50|$|TMAs, {{also known}} as <b>trimethoxyamphetamines,</b> are a family of {{isomeric}} psychedelic hallucinogenic drugs. There exist six different TMAs that differ only {{in the position of}} the three methoxy groups: TMA, TMA-2, TMA-3, TMA-4, TMA-5, and TMA-6. The TMAs are analogs of the phenethylamine cactus alkaloid mescaline. The TMAs are substituted amphetamines, however, their action does not resemble that of the unsubstituted compound amphetamine, which is a stimulant and not a psychedelic. It is reported that some TMA's elicit a range of emotions ranging from sadness to empathy and euphoria. Several TMAs were first synthesized by the chemist Alexander Shulgin. Synthesis data as well as human activity data has been published in the book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved).|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) {{method for}} quantification {{of an active}} psychedelic hallucinogenic drugs (<b>trimethoxyamphetamines)</b> in human urine after solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C 18 cartridge was developed and validated. Chromatographic separation was achieved on reversed-phase Phenomenex 3. 0 &#x 3 bc;m Polar Plus column (150 mm x 2. 1 mm) with acetonitrile - 0. 2 % acetic acid as mobile-phase and the step gradient elution resulted in a total run time of about 20 min. The analytes were detected by using an electrospray positive ionization mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. In the evaluated concentration range (10 - 200 ng/mL) (R 2 &#x 2265; 0. 998) a good linear relationship was obtained. The lower limits of detection (LLODs) and quantification (LLOQs) ranged from 4. 26 to 9. 12 ng/mL and from 13. 18 to 29. 22 ng/mL, respectively. Average recoveries ranged from 68. 52 to 97. 90 % in urine at the concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations were 3. 70 - 10. 77 % and 7. 63 - 12. 94 %, respectively. This LC-MS method proved to be robust and reliable, and suitable for the use as a confirmation method in clinical urine drug testing...|$|R

50|$|DMA, or dimethoxyamphetamine, is {{a series}} of lesser-known {{psychedelic}} drugs similar in structure to amphetamine and to <b>trimethoxyamphetamine</b> (TMA). They were first collectively characterized by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved). Little is known about their dangers or toxicity.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} by some that calamus is a hallucinogen. This urban legend is {{based solely on}} two pages of a book written by Hoffer and Osmund entitled The Hallucinogens. The information on these two pages came from anecdotal reports from two individuals (a husband and wife) who {{reported that they had}} ingested calamus on a few occasions. None of the components in calamus are converted to TMA (<b>trimethoxyamphetamine)</b> in the human organism. To date there is no solid evidence of any hallucinogenic substances in Acorus calamus.|$|E
