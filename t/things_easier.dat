The festival, held at the New Taipei City Hall, featured the Islamic handicraft, cuisine and other cultural elements. New Taipei itself is home to around 30,000 Muslims, making it one of the biggest city in Taiwan in terms of Muslim population. The secretary-general of the Chinese Muslim Association added that Taiwan could benefit a lot by understanding Islam, such as it will make <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> for Taiwan to do export and import trading with the growing Muslim countries, as well as attracting more visitors from various Islamic countries.|$|E
500|$|At {{the insistence}} of {{publishers}} Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes. Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes {{in keeping with the}} new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap. The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether. For example, in the original version of The Hidden Window Mystery (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose African-American servant, [...] "lovable old Beulah... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake." [...] The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, [...] "I try to make <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old-fashioned way. I must confess, though, that I love it." [...] In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a [...] "plump, smiling housekeeper".|$|E

2500|$|Chamberlain {{learned about}} his role in the Yankees {{rotation}} in November, and stated that knowing about the team's plans to use him as a starter rather than as a reliever who would move into a starting role {{at some point in the}} middle of the season (as was the case in 2008) changes his mental approach to preparing for the season, and makes <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> on him.

2500|$|By 1990 Marriott {{was playing}} an average 200 gigs a year, when Frampton flew into Britain and asked Marriott to reform Humble Pie {{to produce a}} one-off album and a reunion tour. The payment {{would be enough to}} allow Marriott to take <b>things</b> <b>easier.</b> He agreed, and they flew out to Frampton's {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles on 27 January 1991. They began writing songs, but the project was never completed, as Marriott {{had a change of heart}} and returned home. Two recorded songs from this final effort, [...] "The Bigger They Come" [...] and [...] "I Won't Let You Down", with Marriott on vocals (and guitar), appeared on Frampton's album Shine On: A Collection. A third song, [...] "Out of the Blue", featuring both Marriott and Frampton, was featured on the first solo recording Frampton made after Marriott's death. A fourth song, [...] "An Itch You Can't Scratch", has been found on many illegal compilations and even on one of two [...] "authorised" [...] British releases. The recording date, and whether Frampton played on it, have never been verified.|$|E
2500|$|The use of immunoinformatics tools can {{be useful}} to predict protein {{allergenicity}} and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [...] So to make these <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> computational tools and algorithms have been actively developed to assess the allergenic potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products.|$|E

2500|$|An updated {{variant of}} the {{broadcast}} flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management group under DVB (DVB-CPCM). Upon publication by DVB, the technical specification was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, {{at the direction of}} the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the EFF, which paid {{to be a member of}} the consortium, [...] "You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices". The DVB claims that the system will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies, thereby making <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> for end users. The normative sections have now all been approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board, and will be published by ETSI as a formal European Standard as ETSI TS 102 825-X where X refers to the Part number of specification. Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a Compliance and Robustness regime for the standard (though several are rumoured to be in development), so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system, as there is nowhere to obtain the necessary device certificates.|$|E
2500|$|Mega Man V was {{developed}} by the same third-party company that worked on three of the four previous Game Boy Mega Man games. According to Mega Man series artist Keiji Inafune, the fifth installment took the longest time to develop of all five of these titles. Inafune was responsible for the game's character designs after their initial concepts were devised. [...] "When you have a theme to follow, it can make <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> and harder at the same time," [...] Inafune recounted. [...] "Especially with a theme as vague as space." [...] He additionally recalled having [...] "a lot of reservations" [...] when designing the Stardroids. Tango was included as a support character not featured in the home console games; his name, like other characters in the series, is part of musical motif. Inafune, who always enjoyed working on animal support characters, was especially pleased to design Tango due to the artist's personal fondness for cats. Mega Man V is the final installment in the Game Boy line of games based on the original Mega Man series. Inafune stated, [...] "In the end, I think {{we had a lot of}} fun working on this series". Mega Man V {{was developed}} with Super Game Boy support, which allows the game to be played with a custom color scheme and border on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was one of the first games available with added support from the peripheral. It was also the last time the classic 8-bit Mega Man sprite was used for a game released on an 8-bit console, and last until Mega Man 9 in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 February 2016, {{after many}} delays {{over whether the}} UCLASS would {{specialize}} in strike or ISR roles, {{it was reported that}} {{a significant portion of the}} UCLASS effort would be directed to produce a Super Hornet–sized carrier-based aerial tanker as the Carrier-Based Aerial-Refueling System (CBARS), with [...] "a little ISR" [...] and some capabilities to relay communications, with strike capabilities deferred to a future version of the aircraft. The Pentagon chose this in order to address the Navy's expected fighter shortfall by directing funds to buy additional Super Hornets and accelerate purchases and development of the F-35C, quickly getting naval stealth fighters into service, and extending their range to penetrate hostile airspace. It will likely be a wing–body–tail configuration that will limit its ability to strike in contested airspace, be more sensitive to cost considerations, and favor Boeing and General Atomics submissions. Having the CBARS as the first carrier-based UAV provides a less complex bridge to the future F/A-XX, should it be an autonomous strike platform. It also addresses the carriers' need for an organic refueling aircraft, proposed as a mission for the UCLASS since 2014, freeing up the 20–30 percent of Super Hornets performing the mission in a more capable and cost effective manner than modifying the F-35, V-22 Osprey, and E-2D Hawkeye, or bringing the retired S-3 Viking back into service. Although initially designated the RAQ-25, the name was changed to the MQ-25 Stingray. Stealth requirements will be [...] "descoped" [...] and it may still be capable of firing missiles or dropping bombs from drop tank pylons, but surveillance and destroying targets will not be its main missions. Reducing the low-observable requirement is expected to make <b>things</b> <b>easier</b> for existing UCLASS competitors, and to open the competition to new entrants. An RFP for the air vehicle is expected in late 2016, followed by a fly-off through 2017; one prime contractor will be selected in 2018, and first delivery will occur in 2021.|$|E
