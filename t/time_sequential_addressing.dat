30|$|Many {{previous}} studies {{assume that all}} information is available when predicting the traffic incident duration because these studies were conducted by utilizing a historical dataset. These models are called one-time models. In fact, obtaining all information when the traffic incident was reported to the centre is almost impossible. Thus, the traffic incident duration time prediction model must accommodate new information as it arrives in its own time sequence. Several studies have considered this challenging problem. A <b>time</b> <b>sequential</b> methodology was developed by Khattak et al. [5] to predict the incident duration as the TMC receives the incident information based on a dataset of 109 large-scale incidents. Khattak et al. [32] developed dynamic incident duration models to predict the incident duration more accurately because additional information can be obtained as an incident progresses. Wei, Lee [16] developed a <b>time</b> <b>sequential</b> traffic incident duration prediction procedure utilizing ANN-based models and data fusion techniques. Lee, Wei [17] then employed ANNs and genetic algorithms to construct two models to provide a sequential prediction of accident duration from the accident notification to clearance. Qi, Teng [55] developed a <b>time</b> <b>sequential</b> procedure that included different hazard-based duration regression models with different variables for each stage according to the specific information available. Lopes et al. [56] developed four adaptive ANN-based models to be activated with the incoming data to improve the predictive performance. Pereira et al.

40|$|Few {{published}} studies characterize early lymphocyte recovery after intensive chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). To test {{the hypothesis that}} lymphocyte recovery mirrors ontogeny, we characterized early lymphocyte recovery in 20 consecutive patients undergoing induction <b>timed</b> <b>sequential</b> chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. Recovering T lymphocytes were predominantly CD 4 + and included a greatly expanded population of CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + T cells. Recovering CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + T cells were phenotypically activated regulatory T cells and showed suppressive activity on cytokine production in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Despite an initial burst of thymopoiesis, most recovering regulatory T cells were peripherally derived. Furthermore, regulatory T cells showed marked oligoclonal skewing, suggesting that their peripheral expansion was antigen-driven. Overall, lymphocyte recovery after chemotherapy differs from ontogeny, specifically identifying a peripherally expanded oligoclonal population of activated regulatory T lymphocytes. These differences suggest a stereotyped immunologic recovery shared by patients with newly diagnosed AML after induction <b>timed</b> <b>sequential</b> chemotherapy. Further insight into this oligoclonal regulatory T-cell population will be fundamental toward developing effective immunomodulatory techniques to improve survival for patients with AML...|$|R
