5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only {{exist for}} {{a certain period of}} time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E

5|$|Some noncoding DNA {{sequences}} play structural {{roles in}} chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but {{are important for}} the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material {{for the creation of}} new genes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of gene duplication and divergence.|$|E
5|$|Such {{cooperation}} within {{species may}} have evolved <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of kin selection, {{which is where}} one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring. This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, {{it is likely that}} its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on. Other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection, where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} within the past 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of insular dwarfism. Fossil evidence indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, {{which may have been}} a Malagasy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes {{in the last}} phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he {{took part in the}} battle of Gniew. His involvement in this conflict, which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, was rather limited, and he spent much time {{in other parts of the}} country. During that period and afterward, he lobbied for support of his candidature for the Polish throne, as his father, Sigismund, was getting more advanced in his age, and the succession to the Polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father Sigismund, tried to ensure Władysław's election during Sigismund's life, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. Sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the issue to be taken up again.|$|E

This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of character creation. The player is successively asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting attributes, skills, and abilities. The player then determines their class in one of three ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via questions, or creating a custom class themselves.|$|E
5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} did {{not find}} anyone guilty of negligence or misconduct, but Lieutenant Admiral Bär, commander of Nyckeln, and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who had run aground on Äpplet, were never again given a command in the navy. Lieutenant Admiral Hans Clerck, commander of Solen, went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> unscathed, and was promoted to full Admiral by the King before the commission even presented its verdict. Creutz has quite consistently been blamed {{for the loss of}} his ship by historians, and has been described as an incompetent sea officer and sailor who more or less single-handedly brought about the sinking through lack of naval experience. Military historians Lars Ericson Wolke and Olof Sjöblom have attempted to nuance the picture by pointing out that Creutz's task was akin to that of an administrator rather than a military commander. The practical issues of ship maneuvering should have been the responsibility of his subordinates, who had experience in naval matters.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history {{of life on}} Earth traces the processes by which living and fossil organisms evolved since life appeared on the planet, until the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years (Ga) ago and {{there is evidence that}} life appeared as early as 4.1 Ga. The similarities among all present-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented in a central database to date. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in every one of the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
