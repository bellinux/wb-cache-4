5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>of</b> {{prose and}} poetry, {{focused on the}} poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.

5|$|According to Nolutshungu, the 1984 {{bilateral}} Franco-Libyan agreement {{may have}} provided Gaddafi with {{an excellent opportunity}} to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habré into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>of</b> all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN.

5|$|Administrative Headquarters, AIF, {{and against}} <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>of</b> Birdwood, Senator Pearce {{appointed}} McCay as {{commander of the}} AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. These depots received and trained reinforcements arriving from Australia, and rehabilitated and retrained convalescents who were released from hospital. McCay established his headquarters at Tidworth, {{in the heart of}} the Salisbury Plain where most of the Australian camps were located. He occupied this post for the remainder of the war, failing in bids to return to an active command at the head of the 5th Division, the Australian Corps, or the 3rd Division when Monash was promoted to corps commander. A bid to replace Birdwood as administrative commander of the AIF also came to naught. For his services in the United Kingdom, McCay was mentioned in despatches a fourth time, made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919.|$|E

An impediment to Nixon's plan for Vietnamization {{of the war in}} Southeast Asia was increasing Viet Cong control of parts of Cambodia, beyond the reach of South Vietnamese troops and used as sanctuaries. Feeling that Nixon was getting overly dovish advice from Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Agnew stated that if the sanctuaries were a threat, they should be attacked and neutralized. Nixon chose to attack the Viet Cong positions in Cambodia, a decision that had Agnew's vigorous support, and that he remained convinced was correct after his resignation.|$|E

Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
