25|$|In 1970 {{extensive}} sandblasting {{was conducted}} on all the steel components of the Waibaidu bridge <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> all <b>rust.</b> A rust-proof zinc spray was then added to the bridge, and the sidewalk railings repainted grey, while the side safety fences were painted white. In 1977 the Shanghai Municipal Design Institute examined and reinforced the beams of the bridge.|$|R
50|$|A {{fibreglass}} eraser, {{a bundle}} of very fine glass fibres, {{can be used for}} erasing and other tasks requiring abrasion. Typically the eraser is a pen-shaped device with a replaceable insert with glass fibres, which wear down in use. The fibres are very hard; in addition <b>to</b> <b>removing</b> pencil and pen markings, such erasers are used for cleaning traces on electronic circuit boards <b>to</b> facilitate soldering, <b>removing</b> <b>rust,</b> and many other applications. As an example of an unusual use, a fibreglass eraser was used for preparing an archaeological fossil embedded in a very hard and massive limestone.|$|R
30|$|Medical grade {{stainless}} steel 316 L (316 L SS) and silicon substrate (for characterization) were selected {{as a substrate}} and pretreatment was performed. Briefly, substrates were cut into 1  ×  1  cm 2 using automated cutting machine (Struers, Tegramin- 25, Denmark). Mirror polishing was done using automated polishing machine (Struers A/S, DK- 2750 Ballerup, Denmark) and silicon carbide emery papers (240 – 1000 mesh sizes) were used to reduce the surface roughness of the substrates. Finally, mirror polished substrates were treated with trichloroethylene in order <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>rust</b> and ultrasonicated for 15  min before coatings.|$|R
25|$|Then, {{the needle}} gun is used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>rust,</b> loose scale, and paint, leaving bare metal. It is used most {{effectively}} by holding it at a 45° {{angle to the}} work surface. It is recommended that an area no larger than six to eight inches be cleared at once. Two to three passes over an area is generally sufficient to clean it. Then the process is repeated until the desired area is completed.|$|E
25|$|Often it is {{possible}} to chemically remove the products of corrosion. For example, phosphoric acid in the form of naval jelly is often applied to ferrous tools or surfaces <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>rust.</b> Corrosion removal {{should not be confused with}} electropolishing, which removes some layers of the underlying metal to make a smooth surface. For example, phosphoric acid may also be used to electropolish copper but it does this by removing copper, not the products of copper corrosion.|$|E

30|$|After testing, each {{corroded}} beam {{was broken}} {{to retrieve the}} corroded stirrups for measurement of the average weight loss of steel due to induced corrosion.

It was estimated that the stabilization project would take roughly six months or perhaps longer given the difficulty of removing the mix of cosmoline and mud which caked on the car. While there were no plans to disassemble or restore the vehicle there were discussions regarding the return of the driveline and electrical system to operating condition.|$|R

Some hammer paints (e.g. by Hammerite) are formulated to be usable directly on rusted steel without surface preparation other than brushing <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the loose <b>rust.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new semiautomated {{instrument}} is described which quantifies {{the number of}} bacteria in potable waters within 3 min, providing a permanent colorimetric record of the results.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the adaptability of hydroxyethane diphosphonic acid (HEDPA) as an environmentally benign alternative rust removal agent, the present investigation was undertaken. The effectiveness of HEDPA was studied {{as a function of}} acid concentration in the range 2 - 20 vol. % and at different temperatures in the temperature range 23 o C- 55 °C. The results suggest that the acid HEDPA is very effective <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>rust</b> and the rate of rust removal depends upon the acid concentration and/or the solution temperature. Once an optimum value is reached, further increase in either the acid concentration and/or the solution temperature has a negative effect on the rust dissolution kinetics. In addition, it was also found that the chemical treatment with concentrated HEDPA solution (concentration range 5 - 20 vol. % HEDPA) produces rust free steel samples with very rough surface topography.

50|$|Restoration of a vehicle’s {{exterior}} {{can take many}} forms. A vehicle that has been left or abandoned will often accumulate rust over time. Sometimes this rust deterioration can render an exterior part unusable. In which case a replacement part like a fender, front grill or door mirror much be purchased outright from an external source. If rust damage is minor however the part will undergo rust repair. This {{is the process of}} <b>removing</b> <b>rust</b> from metal and returning structural integrity. This is accomplished by <b>removing</b> the <b>rust</b> through sanding or blasting to get down to bare metal. Then new sheet metal or fiberglass is applied to the affected area. Finally the piece is worked until smooth, primed and re-painted. Other materials like glass and weather stripping must be replaced as they become damaged over time. Factors like weather erosion can lead to faded and broken glass as well as dried out weather stripping. Another typical area of exterior repair is dent removal. This entails taking the original metal and re-working it <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> dents and other such blemishes. Professionals often use hammer and dolly work <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> dents.
