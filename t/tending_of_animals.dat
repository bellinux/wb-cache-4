There are humorous shepherd songs, which do not contain any biting mockery, but are good-natured gibes, with scenes from the everyday life of a shepherd. The most archaic and most {{closely related to the}} task of herding are the hollos and signals, laments and warbles.|$|E
50|$|Herding songs. Shepherd {{songs are}} sung by children, while nightherding songs are sung by adults. The {{shepherding}} songs reflect the actual <b>tending</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> the social situation of children, {{as well as}} references to ancient beliefs. The raliavimai or warbles are also recitative type melodies, distinguished by the vocable ralio, which is meant to calm the animals. The raliavimai have no set poetic or musical form being free recitatives, unified by the refrains. Some warbles end in a prolonged ululation, based on a major or minor third.|$|E
50|$|Her diary {{depicts the}} details of {{everyday}} life {{of the people of}} all classes at the estate and its surrounding countryside, the harvests, the <b>tending</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> household tasks and the weather. It focuses on the economy and management of the estate but also its everyday life as well as the more festive occasions: its close vicinity to the capital also offers accounts of historical political events as well as news of fashion and pleasure. The diary describes her own interest in literature and the theater. Her language is described as realistic, dry, sober and to the point, focused on describing facts as they were rather than to write of personal reflections or thoughts, and it is clear that she is an efficient manager of a big household and aware of her own value. Though herself noble, it appears that her circle of acquaintances were mostly from the burgher middle class.|$|E

40|$|Like {{other areas}} <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science, the study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> {{behaviour}} {{is becoming increasingly}} subject to eth-ical regulation and legislation. Sensible and well-informed regulation is to be welcomed both on compas-sionate grounds and because misuse <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is likely to compromise the science itself. However, {{it is evident that}} much of the impetus and direction in the regulation debate is coming from one particular corner <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science: that concerned with utilitarian and commercial interests taking place in con-trolled laboratory environments. This is sustained by an overemphasis on potential medical benefits as the perceived key selling point for animal science to a hostile public. Such a bias risks potentially unfor-tunate consequences for wider aspects <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science, and is unlikely to serve the best welfare interests <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> when viewed from their own biological perspective. I review some of the concerns that arise from this, and suggest that the study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> behaviour has a uniquely important role to play both in the development <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> welfare science itself and in the public debate about the regulation <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science as a whole...|$|R
