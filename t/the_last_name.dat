5|$|It grows well as {{far north}} as western coast of Scotland, {{including}} the village of Plockton. It is more common in Southern England and in Ireland where it is grown all over the island. Although not a palm, it is locally named Cornish palm, Manx palm or Torbay palm. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> is due to its extensive use in Torbay, it being the official symbol of that area, used in tourist posters promoting South Devon as the English Riviera. It also grows in Spain, Italy and Japan. Even though the natural distribution of C.australis ranges from 34° S to 46°S, and despite its ultimately tropical origins, it also grows at about five degrees from the Arctic Circle in Masfjorden, Norway, latitude 61ºN, in a microclimate protected from arctic winds and moderated by the Gulf Stream.|$|E

5|$|The McKeesport Olympics, a {{team from}} McKeesport, Pennsylvania, was the All-Americans next opponent. This game had to be played outside of Pennsylvania because of that state's blue laws which {{disallowed}} football on Sundays. In fact, {{this was one of}} only two away games for the Olympics. Hughitt scored a rushing touchdown in the first quarter to start the game. In the second quarter, Hughitt threw a touchdown pass to offensive lineman Heinie Miller to bring the All-Americans' lead to 14–0 going into halftime. The Olympics scored their only points of the game in the third quarter. A player with <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> of Schreiner caught a receiving touchdown. The All-Americans answered when offensive lineman Lou Little blocked a field goal and ran it back for a touchdown.

5|$|Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a {{young girl}} she began using <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, instead of her father's name. She grew up in rural Nevada and {{attended}} the University of Nevada in Reno and the University of Oregon in Eugene, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the Spectator newspaper and freelanced for The Oregonian, both in Portland, Oregon. During her years in Portland (1909–1915), she became active in the women's suffrage movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to Greenwich Village, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as The Masses, or at meetings of a women's group, Heterodoxy, or through work with the Provincetown Players. During a National Woman's Party suffrage rally in Washington, D.C., in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Like Reed, she had lovers outside of marriage, and during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) these included playwright Eugene O'Neill and painter Andrew Dasburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{ballpark}} for the New York {{team was}} constructed between 165th and 168th Streets, on Broadway in Manhattan. Formally known as American League Park, it was nicknamed Hilltop Park {{because of its}} relatively high elevation. The team {{did not have an}} official nickname; it was often called the New York Americans in reference to the AL. Another common nickname for the club was the Highlanders, a play on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> of the team's president, Joe Gordon, and the British military unit, the Gordon Highlanders. The team acquired players such as outfielder Willie Keeler and pitcher Jack Chesbro. The player-manager was Clark Griffith, obtained from the Chicago White Sox. On April 22, 1903, the Highlanders began their season with a 3–1 loss to the Washington Senators; eight days later, they won their first game in Hilltop Park, defeating the Senators 6–2. New York fell out of contention for the AL pennant in May, falling to seventh place after playing games away from Hilltop Park for a 24-day period while construction on the stadium concluded. With a final record of 72–62 after wins in 19 of 29 games played in September, New York finished in fourth.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> {{applied to}} M-53 is the Earle Memorial Highway, {{named in honor}} of Horatio Earle, Michigan's first State Highway Commissioner. Earle was {{instrumental}} in the early Good Roads Movement in the state and the creation of the Michigan State Highway Department, which is now MDOT. When the original legislation creating a highway agency was declared unconstitutional in 1903, he kept the job in an unofficial capacity until the Legislature could rectify the situation. Earle designated that the first mile of state reward road in The Thumb, and residents formed a group to lobby to have the road named in his honor. The State Highway Commissioner Murray Van Wagoner designated M-53 in Earle's memory in April 1939, and the Legislature legislation two years later honoring him, but not officially naming the road. That was corrected in 2001 when the statutes naming various highways in the state were consolidated, and M-53 was officially designated the Earle Memorial Highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons and Greed both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that Greed influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> McTeague.|$|E
