[...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier {{than it used to}} be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in the last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E

5000|$|Job {{analysis}} methods have evolved using both task-oriented and worker-oriented approaches. Since {{the end result}} of both approaches is a statement of KSAOs, neither can be considered the [...] "correct" [...] way to conduct job analysis. Because worker-oriented job analyses tend to provide more generalized human behavior and behavior patterns and are less tied to the technological parts of a job, they produce data more useful for developing training programs and giving feed back to employees in the form of performance appraisal information. Also, the volatility that exists in the typical workplace of today can make specific task statements less valuable in isolation. For these reasons, employers are significantly more likely to use worker-oriented approaches to job analysis <b>today</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in the past.|$|E

The setting-up of a steady state, block structured simulation program was part of this development. A new phase model for the ammonia carbon dioxide-urea-water system at urea synthesis conditions has also been developed. Detailed models for apparatus specific to the urea process such as reactors, carbon dioxide strippers, ammonia strippers, etc. have been included in the generalized simulation program. A powerful convergence promoter based on the evolutionary approach has been used to solve the recycle problems. The simulation program has been verified against experimental data obtained from industrial plants in a full range of process conditions. Simulation results for the H. P. urea synthesis loops of the Snamprogetti ammonia stripping process and the Stamicarbon CO 2 stripping process are presented. © 1988...|$|R
