5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} main types of monastics. Those {{who live in}} monasteries under a common rule are coenobitic. Each monastery may {{formulate}} its own rule, and {{although there are no}} religious orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are highly influential. Eremitic monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary lives. It is <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.|$|E

No book called for violence or war, and many books reportedly expressed <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> for peace between Israel and the Arab countries. However, some textbooks within the Orthodox Jewish community were found to contain prejudices towards Palestinians and the Arabs were often held responsible for Israel's wars.|$|E

25|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the masnavi of the Ottoman {{period is}} that they almost always possess, beneath the literal meaning, a subtle spiritual signification. Many poems, of Mesnevi of Mevlana and the Divan of Aşık Paşha examples of confessedly religious, moral, or mystic but a much larger number are allegorical. To this latter class belong almost all the long romantic mesnevis of the Persian and mid Ottoman poets; in {{the stories of the}} loves of Leyla and Mecnun, Yusuf and Zuleykha, Kusrev and Shavin, Suleyman and Ebsal, and a hundred of like kind, can see pictured, if we look beneath the surface, the soul of man for God, or <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> of the human heart after heavenly light and wisdom. There is not a character introduced into those romances but represents the passion not an incident but has some spiritual meaning. In the history of Iskender, or Alexander, we watch the noble human soul in its struggles against the powers of this world, and, when aided by God and guided by the heavenly wisdom of righteous teachers, its ultimate victory over every earthly passion, and its attainment of that point of divine serenity whence it can look calmly down on all sublunary things.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{talk about}} {{substance}} abuse and <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> for a long lost love more than drugs. [...] "Just one last puff and two last regrets/Three spirits and 12 lonely steps", Gaga sings, before uttering the hook, [...] "I need you more than dope". The lyrics meant that the singer wanted her lost love more than an addict pines for drugs. [...] "Dope" [...] {{is one of the}} most personal songs of Gaga, according to Joe Lynch from Fuse. With lines like [...] "I promise this drink is my last one / I know I fucked up again / Because I lost my only friend", Lynch believed that Gaga was referring to her former assistant Jennifer O'Neil who had months ago moved to court against the singer for unpaid wages.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, with critics complimenting its simple production, the songwriting and Gaga's vocals. An electronic rock lament, in {{the vein}} of Irish folk ballad rue, [...] "Dope" [...] is a bittersweet song {{centered on a}} dark theme. It has a minimal production and is only composed off Gaga's vocals sung in an intoxicated slur. Lyrically it talks about substance abuse and <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> for a long lost love. Previous to the release Gaga uploaded an image of herself on Instagram, wearing a snapback featuring the word DOPE. She also posted the song's lyrics there, triggering the social media website's concern. The artwork featured Gaga with a big blazer, her face covered with a hat and a grill that made her teeth appear larger.

Music writer Donarld A. Guarisco later {{wrote of the}} song's sound, in that [...] "Marvin Gaye's studio recording enhances the dreamy style of the song with stately horn and strings, tumbling drum fills that gently nudge the song along, and mellow, doo wop-styled background vocals that echo [...] "love her, you love her" [...] under his romantic pleas. The song later became a concert favorite for Gaye and a live concert version, featuring female fans screaming in the background, was released as a single from his Marvin Gaye Live! album in 1974.|$|E

500|$|... "Fly Like a Bird" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad, drawing {{influence}} from Gospel, soul and R music genres. It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the organ, bass drum and trumpet. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, {{the song is}} set in common time with a moderate tempo of 54 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B minor with Carey's vocal range spanning almost four octaves, from the low-note of B2 in a background note to the high-note of A6. The song's chorus has a chord progression of Fm7-Bm-G/A-Bmaj7 in the verses, while changing into Gmaj7 during the bridge. Lyrically, [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] boasts a prayer in which the protagonist asks God for help during difficult times, and to carry them [...] "higher and higher".

Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast compared it {{to the work of}} singer Bruce Springsteen, adding that the [...] "power ballad is the kind destined for last-call sing-a-longs at those bars with peanut shells on the floor, with Gaga belting over tickling ivories about trusting instincts and charging into the unknown." [...] Michael Cragg of The Guardian called [...] "Gypsy" [...] an [...] "epic narrative about fame and loneliness" [...] with the composition comparable to [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] and a vocal riff similar to that of [...] "Poker Face".

Subsequent reports stated that Swinton had repeatedly posed as a child victim. A girl matching [...] "Sarah's" [...] description was not found, and authorities rounded up members of the church. Subsequently, the children—213 boys and 250 girls—were separated from their parents and transported to Fort Concho, [...] "a military facility with inadequate food, lavatories or bathing facilities, and little privacy for people to whom modesty was a basic dignity". After it was determined that {{there was no evidence that}} the children were unhealthy, mistreated, or in danger of suffering abuse at the hands of the FLDS, they were returned to the ranch.|$|E

500|$|About Ocean's writing, Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent {{stated that}} the [...] "strength of his songwriting {{is his ability to}} make the {{unfamiliar}} feel intensely personal, as if you're a friend that has long known all the particulars of his relationships." [...] He continued, [...] "Thinking About You" [...] is also more primal, though. <b>The</b> <b>yearning</b> in his falsetto is almost palpable as he flips gender roles and admits that he's been [...] "thinking about forever," [...] while simultaneously questioning if the [...] "girl" [...] even had that kinda thing on her mind." [...] Erika Ramirez of Billboard wrote that the track [...] "gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility, as he intertwines the parallel styles of soul, R, jazz and even a bit of funk."

[...] Like Croft, Sim said he wrote much of his lyrics at night when his emotions ran [...] "a bit higher". Because of their reserved personalities, Robert Christgau believed they relied on a low-key, vulnerable style and [...] "traded ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends". According to NME magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs dealt with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on [...] "VCR", <b>the</b> <b>yearning</b> expressed on [...] "Heart Skipped a Beat", and the premature affection warned of on [...] "Crystalised". Petra Davis from The Quietus argued that the thematic crux of xx was in the succession of songs from [...] "Islands" [...] to [...] "Shelter", each of which saw [...] "a radical shift in perspective on a similar—perhaps a single—love story." ...|$|E
500|$|The text by Christoph Birkmann {{reflects}} {{life of the}} Christian as {{a voluntary}} journey [...] "carrying the cross" [...] as a follower of Jesus. The text refers indirectly to the prescribed gospel reading which tells that Jesus traveled by boat, which {{on the other hand}} refers to a navigational instrument called Kreuzstab, the Jacob's staff. The poet used the imagery to liken life to a sea voyage, finally reflecting a yearning for death to reach the ultimate destination. <b>The</b> <b>yearning</b> for death is re-enforced by the choice of a closing chorale, the stanza [...] "" [...] (Come, o death, you brother of sleep) from Johann Franck's 1653 hymn [...] "" [...] which also relates to the ship voyage imagery. Bach, who composed the cantata in his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, structured the cantata in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives for a bass soloist and closing with a four-part chorale, and chose a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three woodwind instruments (two oboes and taille) playing mostly with three string instruments (two violins and viola), and continuo, with an obbligato cello in the first recitative and an obbligato oboe in the second aria, resulting in different timbres for the four movements for the same voice part.|$|E
