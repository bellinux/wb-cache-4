40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of strategy instruction on the reading comprehension of high school students with ADHD. The research design was a multiple baseline across participants design with multiple probes during baseline (Kazdin, 1982). The participants were three female high school students with ADHD who were also experiencing reading comprehension problems based on standardized test scores. These students were taught the <b>TRAPeR</b> reading comprehension strategy (Think before you read, Read a paragraph, Ask yourself what are the main idea and two supporting details from the paragraph, Paraphrase the main idea and supporting details in your own words, and Review what you read) using the Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD) model. Evidence of the strategy instruction 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness was seen in an increase in the number of main ideas and supporting details recalled in an oral summary of the social studies reading passages used in the study. The direct and intensive strategy instruction following the SRSD approach lead to improvement in the reading comprehension performance of the participants, suggesting that strategy instruction following the SRSD approach may be an effective reading intervention for high school students with ADHD. ...|$|E
40|$|Title of the thesis: Food {{supplements}} and nutrition {{and performance of}} professional cyclists The goal of the paper: The aim of my work is to determine differences in the useing of dietary {{supplements and}} performance by professional cyclists. I also find out how different are the twosupplementation groups monitored before, during and after exercise. I focused on it also which marks of supplements by professional cyclist and cyclist who prefer performance. Of course I did not neglect to compare the groups surveyed drinks. Methodology: The data I obtained through a questionnaire that I circulated by an e-mail over the Internet. With some athletes I regularly meet in person, that I used for directly answering a questionnaire. The questionnaire used was clear and simple questions. The questionnaire is given below in the Annex. Most of the respondents interviewed were male and the age range was wide. Results: The {{results show that the}} greatest differences between groups of respondents are insupplementation before, during and after exercise. Differences are also in used the labeling of dietary suplements. Professional cyclists gather information about supplements from sources other than performance cyclists. Professional cyclists are mostly used by councils <b>traper</b> or learn from the experience of thein team [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{final report}} {{summarizes}} {{the progress of}} work and results for the whole period of the project. The subject is modelling of tasks within the project Decovalex- 2015, development of Flow 123 d software, and preparation of documents for its standardization using the comparison results with foreign teams. TUL team participated in Task C 1 (THMC processes in a single fracture) using the software Geochemist’s Workbench and their own tool <b>TrAper</b> for connecting chemistry and deformation and Task C 2 (flow and transport {{in the vicinity of}} the tunnel Bedřichov) using Flow 123 d software. Task C 2 also includes the formulation of the assignment and coordination of the solution of other teams. The ÚGN team participated in Task A, focusing on saturation of bentonite seals in clay rock and closing the gap, with the help of the COMSOL Multiphysics software. The outputs are the joint report by international teams and papers in a special issue of a journal. The developed models and lessons learned contribute to the ability to predict phenomena in the deep geological repository. Another result is a set of documents for the Flow 123 d software. All of which are attached to the report as attachments...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Diploma thesis was {{to assess}} the {{cultivar}} tolerance of a chosen assortment of butterhead lettuce, leaf lettuce, iceberg lettuce and cabbage to fungal pathogens (Bremia lactucae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans). The experiment was conducted in the laboratory conditions of the gardening department FAPPZ of the Czech University of Agriculture in growth chambers. The lettuce experiments were done in given conditions with the temperatures of 18 - 20 °C under the regime 12 hrs. of light and 12 hrs. of darkness. The cabbage experiments were conducted in given conditions under the regime 12 hrs. of light and 12 hrs. of darkness with the temperatures of 14 °C during the day and 12 °C in the night. The lettuce plants were planted in dishes on fine sand. All experiments had infected and control variants. After emergence, the experimental plants were inoculated with variants of the selected pathogen. The plants were observed in 2 - 3 day intervals throughout the whole experiment. The experiment was assessed using the modified standard method according to Pawelec et al. (2006). A modified method with a percentage scale was used to assess the lettuce experiments. Cabbage experiments were evaluated with a scale of points ranging from 0 to 9 according to the percentage of infection on the plants. The results of the methodology were determined using the program Statistica 12. In the experiments evaluating the variety tolerance of a chosen assortment leaf lettuce and iceberg lettuce to the pathogen Bremia lactucae Bl: 31, a statistically significant difference in the sensitivity to this pathogen was established. The results show that the most resistant varieties are Tarzan, Stamir, Adinal a Verala. The greatest sensitivity to the pathogen Bl: 31 has a variety "Dětenická Atrakce" then <b>Traper</b> and Nikolaj. Effect of seed treatment with hot water (HWT) to suppress pathogen B. lactucae was statistically significant in the varieties "Dětenická Atrakce" (10 % decrease) and Dubáček (7 % decrease) compared with untreated infectious variant with HWT. In the sensitivity evaluation of varieties and lines of white cabbage was a statistically significant difference in infecting of pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. Sp. conglutinans breed 1. The most significantly susceptible to the pathogen Foc was variety Pourovo late-season (degree of assault after inoculation was 6. 52 points) ...|$|E
