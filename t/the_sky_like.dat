25|$|The {{directional}} {{qualities of}} the radiogoniometer work in both directions; {{it can be used}} to determine the direction of an incoming signal, or change the direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>like</b> a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific start signal, often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the start signal to the maximum in the continuous tone, and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle.|$|E

Who even knew if {{there was still a}} road to Roubaix? If Roubaix was still there? The car of organisers and journalists made its way along the route those first riders had gone. And at first all looked well. There was destruction and there was poverty and there was a strange shortage of men. But France had survived. But then, as they neared the north, the air began to reek of broken drains, raw sewage and the stench of rotting cattle. Trees which had begun to look forward to spring became instead blackened, ragged stumps, their twisted branches pushed to <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>like</b> the crippled arms of a dying man. Everywhere was mud. Nobody knows who first described it as 'hell', but there was no better word. And that's how it appeared next day in the papers: that little party had seen 'the hell of the north.' ...|$|E

The main centerpiece of this section is a large solar telescope projecting images of the Sun, using a series of mirrors called coelostats. Exhibits here include a periodic table of the elements, a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and several alcoves showing exhibits about topics like day and night, the paths of the Sun and stars, the seasons, the phases of the Moon, tides, and eclipses.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Big Dipper" [...] (a term mainly {{used in the}} United States and Canada; Plough and (historically) Charles' Wain {{are used}} in the United Kingdom) is an {{asterism}} within Ursa Major composed of seven bright stars (six of them of second magnitude or higher) that together comprise one of the best-known patterns in <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>Like</b> many of its common names allude to, its shape is said to resemble either a ladle, an agricultural plough or wagon; in the context of Ursa Major, they are commonly drawn to represent the hindquarters and tail of the Great Bear.

[...] He placed another piece in the south, , Morning Star. Then Coyote said, [...] "This is too long. I have a better way." [...] He then snapped the blanket and the rest of the rock-star mica was scattered across the sky.|$|E
2500|$|The Fragile was {{included}} on several magazines' [...] "end-of-year" [...] album lists, including The Village Voice (number 14), Rolling Stone (number four), and Spin (number one). In a retrospective review, The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) gave it three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars and wrote that, as [...] "NIN's monumental double-disc bid for the art-rock crown, The Fragile sounds fantastic from start to finish, but there aren't enough memorable tunes underneath the alluring surfaces." [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine offered similar criticism, writing that [...] "Reznor's music is immaculately crafted and arranged, with every note and nuance gliding into the next — but he spent more time constructing surfaces than songs. Those surfaces can be enticing but since it's just surface, The Fragile winds up being vaguely unsatisfying." [...] In 2005, The Fragile was ranked number 341 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. But, even if initial reception was mixed, the album has gotten a cult following from Nine Inch Nails fans. In 2016, Exclaim! listed The Fragile at number two on their [...] "Essential Albums" [...] list for Nine Inch Nails, citing it as their most ambitious work and [...] "a tragic if not stunning portrait of depression." [...] Pitchfork would later reassess the album in their review of the album's 2017 [...] "Definitive Edition", describing it as Reznor's [...] "magnum opus... The Fragile scrapes <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>like</b> never before." ...|$|E
