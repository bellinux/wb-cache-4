5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
50|$|Marx {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{extension of}} the labor theory of value (the theory of value used by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, etc.) indicated capitalists (owners {{of the means of}} production) would exploit workers by depriving them of value that workers themselves create. According to Marx, surplus value is the difference between <b>the</b> value <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> has created and <b>the</b> wage <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> receives from his/her employer.|$|R
50|$|In this section, Marx {{explains}} {{the significance of}} machinery to capitalists {{and how it is}} applied to the workforce. The goal of introducing machinery into the workforce is to increase productivity. When productivity is increased, the commodity being produced is cheapened. Relative surplus value is amplified because machinery shortens the part of <b>the</b> day <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> works for his or her means of subsistence and increases <b>the</b> time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> produces for <b>the</b> capitalist.|$|R

5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and older workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, which makes a colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E
5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{the company}} Global Horizons was indicted {{on charges of}} {{trafficking}} over 200 Thai workers. With the program, bonded labor, it was guaranteed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> were going to receive a visa, {{that would allow them}} to live and work in the United States. Upon arrival, the company made a false statement to lure the workers and having a higher recruitment. The fees that were imposed to the farm workers were so high, that the debt was impossible to pay with the employment they were given.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{labor force}} participation with particular reference to <b>the</b> discouraged <b>worker</b> effect. Discouraged workers {{are those who}} do not search for work because they view their chances of finding a suitable job as too low. The theoretical point of departure is a search model where <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> evaluates <b>the</b> expected utility of searching for work and decides to participate in the labor market if the expected utility of the search exceeds the utility of not working. From this framework we derive an empirical model for <b>the</b> probability <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> will be unemployed or employed {{as a function of the}} probability of getting an acceptable job, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> searches for work. The model is estimated on a sample of married and cohabitating women in Norway covering the period from 1988 to 2008. <b>The</b> results show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> discouraged <b>worker</b> effect is substantial. On average, about one third of those who are out of the labor force are discouraged according to our analysis. Discouraged workers; Labor force participation; Random utility modeling...|$|R

25|$|When Frondizi took office, he {{fulfilled}} {{his promise}} {{of maintaining a}} united CGT. Three groups of trade unions operated under the CGT umbrella at the time, and the idea was fiercely opposed by the 32s and 19s, since one centralized trade union would mean, in practice, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> movement would be controlled by the Peronists. The government faced two options, one was an election in which the proportional representation system was used; the other option was an electoral system which hand control of the trade unions to the majority (Peronist). Frondizi reversed Aramburu's attempts to de-Peronize labor, promptly returning six unions to their Peronist leadership, and appointing one of their own, Alfredo Allende, as Labor Minister.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{vineyards}} of the Mittelmosel {{include the}} sundial (German Sonnenuhr) vineyards; Brauneberg Juffer-Sonnenuhr, Wehlener Sonnenuhr, Zeltinger Sonnenuhr.

Since these vineyards receive the most exposure to the sun, many of the wines produced from these vineyards are richer and more full-bodied than wine produced from other vineyards. In a similar way to many of Burgundy's Grand Cru vineyards, the Sonnenuhr vineyards are highly parceled with multiple owners of individual plots or rows of vines. The Wehlener Sonnenuhr vineyard alone has more than 200 owners.|$|E
