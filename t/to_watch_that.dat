Anti-religious prisoners were {{planted in the}} Polish block <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> the rule was not broken, but some found ways to circumvent the prohibition: clandestinely celebrating the mass on their work details. By 1944, conditions had been relaxed and Poles could hold a weekly service. Eventually, {{they were allowed to}} attend the chapel, with Germany's hopes of victory in the war fading.|$|E

In New Zealand, A Dog's Show was a popular television show until the late 1980s, screening just before the weekend news. In the United Kingdom between 1975 and 1999, the BBC ran One Man and His Dog, which had a large urban audience. The movie Babe, about a pig who wants to herd sheep, was based on Dick King-Smith's book The Sheep Pig, about sheepdog trials in northern England.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explains}} {{the departure of}} journalism teacher Mallory Dent (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), who made her last appearance in [...] "The Girl Next Door", also introducing Dent's replacement, Geena Stafford, who is subsequently fired in the same episode. The episode introduces a romantic relationship between Veronica and Logan through their first kiss. Originally, Veronica and Logan were {{not intended to be}} a couple. At PaleyFest 2014, series creator Rob Thomas stated that [...] "The truth is, we never had any intention at all for Logan to end up with Veronica. [...] was hired to be the obligatory psychotic jackass. In the writers' room, sitting around watching dailies, we would all gather around, and it was like, 'We want <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that.</b> We want to watch those two onscreen together.'" [...] However, Dohring and Bell found out the plan for the two characters around the filming of [...] "Return of the Kane" [...] or [...] "The Girl Next Door".|$|E

500|$|Not all critics {{liked the}} episode. Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV {{felt that this}} episode did {{not live up to}} the show's potential. San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman lamented that [...] "the {{original}} [...] was funnier" [...] than the one that aired. Tom Shales of Washington Post said that [...] "the show needs a better premise and funnier dialogue". Despite this, Shales said that 30 Rock [...] "is not a self-important bore like Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip", and praised Tracy Morgan's performance as Tracy Jordan. The New York Times Alessandra Stanley praised Alec Baldwin's [...] "slyly absurd comic presence that is bigger and brighter than any joke or character actor on the show", but mentioned that [...] "Nothing very funny happens on 30 Rock until Alec Baldwin enters the room, and suddenly this new NBC sitcom comes alive". Fey herself felt the episode did not introduce the show well, calling it [...] "awkward, sweaty...I never want <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> mess again" [...] in her memoir Bossypants.|$|E

Johnny Ballgame of GamePro {{concluded that}} the game was [...] "a very strong contender for PlayStation game of the year" [...] and that the [...] "rowdy rowdy" [...] gameplay will keep your head spinning for days." [...] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine considered the game to be [...] "the best 2.5D platformer ever released." [...] Ryan MacDonald of GameSpot said that Crash Bandicoot: Warped is [...] "easily the best Crash yet," [...] describing how all of its aspects were superior to previous installments in the series, and {{concluded that the}} game was [...] "the most fun I've had with a 3D platform game in a long, long time." [...] Mark Cooke of Game Revolution called the game [...] "a barrage of good things" [...] and said that the game's elements [...] "all come together perfectly." [...] Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame ("All Game Guide" [...] at the time) considered the game to be [...] "so impressive <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> you'll have to keep one hand firmly below your chin to keep it from falling to the floor." ...|$|E
500|$|Resonance of Fate {{received}} [...] "mildly positive" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game launched in Japan with 145,000 copies {{sold in the}} first week across both platforms but dropped off Media Create's top 30 list within a month. Critics were most vocal in their praise of the gameplay and battle system. Eurogamer called its innovative design [...] "one of the most inspired approaches to the role-playing video game seen in a decade." [...] IGN stated that [...] "the battle system in Resonance of Fate is strong enough to hold everything together" [...] and added [...] "the unique combat system steps up to be the star of the show." [...] GameSpot noted that [...] "the cinematography used during hero actions is so over-the-top and exciting <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> it makes battles a joy to take part in." [...] USgamer also lauded the faster pace of the combat system and its emphasis on teamwork to win battles. But some reviewers noted that [...] "the flow of combat in Resonance of Fate is initially confusing, especially if you don't take the optional tutorial." [...] The game was the runner-up for RPGamer's Best Battle System award.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of The Lion King coincided {{with that of}} Pocahontas, {{which most of the}} animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two. The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job [...] "because the story wasn't very good", and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft [...] "I don't know who is going to want <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> one." [...] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal. Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa. Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] sequence, were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King. Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1974 {{until his}} 2002 death, Waylon Jennings {{performed}} a song {{he had written}} called [...] "Bob Wills Is Still The King".

[...] In addition, The Rolling Stones performed this song live in Austin, Texas at Zilker Park on their A Bigger Bang Tour, thereby giving the song, and Bob Wills, a broader audience. [...] This performance was included on their subsequent DVD The Biggest Bang. In a 1968 issue of Guitar Player, rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix said of Wills and the Playboys: [...] "I dig them.

To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope.
