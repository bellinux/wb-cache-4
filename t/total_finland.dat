25|$|Construction workers {{included}} Russian soldiers {{but also}} Finnish civilian workers and forced labour using prisoners transported from far east. Finns were exempt from conscription, and thus there was available manpower for fortification works. The payment for fortification works was slightly above average for manual labour, {{and made it}} an attractive option particularly for many rural workers. In 1915 when large scale construction of fortifications around Finland began Russians instituted a work responsibility for Finns based on wartime emergency law to obtain the necessary labour force. To ease the manpower shortage Russians brought convicted prisoners from far east to Finland in summer 1916 as forced labour. Approximately 2000-3000 men, including Chinese, Kyrgyz and Tatars, were employed as lumberjacks around Espoo and Sipoo. Kyrgyz were mainly guards. Asian workers were transported back to Russia already in 1917 however, citing the workers to be unaccustomed to the northern climate and possible threat of rebellion.

In {{order to produce}} comparable results from dietary assessments, the national food composition databases (FCDB) must contain mutually comparable food composition data. Systematic comparison (definition, unit of measurement, and method of analysis) of energy, protein, fats, carbohydrates, cholesterol, fiber, 13 vitamins, and 8 minerals was carried out among the FCDB of the four countries. Total fat, cholesterol, vitamin A: retinol equivalents and beta-carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, vitamin B- 12, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc are comparable across all four databases. Carbohydrates, fiber, sugars, fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin E: alpha-tocopherol, vitamin K, vitamin C, pantothenic acid, niacin, manganese, and copper are comparable or can be converted comparable at least across three of the databases. Vitamin E: alpha-tocopherol equivalents, will be comparable across all databases after Finland and Germany subtract tocotrienols from their values. Nitrogen values {{were added to the}} Swedish and US databases. After recalculation of protein from nitrogen (Sweden and US), and subtraction of fiber from the <b>total</b> carbohydrate (<b>Finland)</b> followed by recalculations of energy, these values will be comparable across the countries.

40|$|This Bachelor Thesis {{is focused}} on the {{possibilities}} of reintegration for homeless people and the government's approach to the homelessness issue. Analysis of the current possibilities of reintegration brings results that support for homeless is provided mainly by non profit-making organizations, eg. Naděje, Nový prostor or Armáda spásy. Homeless people have an opportunity to use the services of shelters. They can achieve earnings as workers in the social firms, community work, or sheltered employment. Based on the comparison of the newly introduced Strategy for Preventing and Tackling Homelessness in the Czech Republic by 2020 with the approach to the homelessness issue in Finland and Canada this thesis recommends especially to target measures to the most affected areas of homelessness and to reassess financing. Comparison of selected countries brings the finding that Canada has the highest proportion of homeless people in the <b>total</b> population and <b>Finland</b> has the largest expenditures on homelessness issue...|$|R
40|$|Background: The main {{aim of this}} {{cross-sectional}} {{study was to investigate}} the prevalence and severity of erosive tooth wear and its association with dental caries and socio-demographic factors among middle-aged Finnish adults. Methods: Of the <b>total</b> Northern <b>Finland</b> Birth Cohort 1966 (n = 12, 058), a convenience sample (n = 3181 adults) was invited for an oral health examination of which 1962 (61. 7 %) participated, comprising the final study group. Clinical examinations were carried out by trained and calibrated dentists. Erosive tooth wear was assessed by sextants using the Basic Erosive Wear Examination Index (BEWE, 0 - 18) and dental caries at surface level using the ICDAS criteria (0 - 6). Socio-demographic data were obtained from a postal questionnaire. A logistic regression model was generated to test the association of the variables. Results: The prevalence of erosive tooth wear was 75 % and the mean of the BEWE sum score was 3. 4 (SD 3. 30). Almost half of the members needed non-invasive or invasive measures to prevent further progression of the condition. Of those with erosive lesions, 14. 6 % suffered from severe erosive tooth wear. There was a strong positive relationship between the presence of severe erosive tooth wear (BEWE sum score >= 9) and male gender and restorative treatment need. Conclusions: Erosive tooth wear is a common finding in Finnish adult population; almost one in ten suffer from severe erosive tooth wear. Restorative treatment need seems to be associated with severe erosive tooth wear...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the sensitivity of managed boreal forests to climate change, with consequent needs to adapt the management to climate change. Model simulations representing the Finnish territory between 60 and 70 ° N showed that climate change may substantially change the dynamics of managed boreal forests in northern Europe. This is especially probable at {{the northern and southern}} edges of this forest zone. In the north, forest growth may increase, but the special features of northern forests may be diminished. In the south, climate change may create a suboptimal environment for Norway spruce. Dominance of Scots pine may increase on less fertile sites currently occupied by Norway spruce. Birches may compete with Scots pine even in these sites and the dominance of birches may increase.
