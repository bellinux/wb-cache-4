5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%. Admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit {{is associated with a}} mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E

5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires admission to <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care,</b> close observation {{and treatment of}} abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in <b>the</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit for fears his windpipe would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} {{critically}} review our criteria for elective admission to <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit following adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Materials and methods: We reviewed 122 children electively admitted between 1997 and 2011. During this time, our {{criteria for admission}} evolved. Results: In these 122 children, the respiratory disturbance index during {{rapid eye movement sleep}} ranged from 6 to 159 (mean, 83). Forty-one per cent of the children had a recognised co-morbidity. Nine children required extra intervention, i. e. in addition to re-positioning and/or supplemental oxygen. One child was an unplanned re-admission after discharge from <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit. Over <b>the</b> same period, five children required unplanned transfers into <b>the</b> paediatric <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit following adenotonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing.

40|$|Lately, {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} sleep problems. Poor quality sleep, insomnia or intentional sleep shortening are risk factors for cardiovascular disease development, overweight, diabetes and mental disorders. During hospitalization in the ICU the sleep quality in patients usually worsens not only because the disease itself but also owing to other factors, such as fear, anxiety, lack of information on the disease, unfamiliar environment or noisy monitors. The theoretical part is divided into five basic chapters as follows: sleep characteristics, the issue of sleep, cardiovascular disease, meeting sleep needs in patients in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit and <b>the</b> intervention of a nurse in meeting sleep needs in the sleep laboratory. I set two objectives in my thesis: The first objective: to learn if sleep needs in patients in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit are met. The second objective: to identify factors influencing the fulfilment of sleep needs in patients in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit. Two hypotheses were suggested: The hypothesis I: sleep needs in patients hospitalized in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit are not met, The hypothesis II: the most percieved factor influencing sleep in patients in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit was <b>the</b> change of environment. To achieve the objectives I used the questionnaire method. The research set included patients hospitalized in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit in <b>the</b> České Budějovice hospital, Inc. The obtained data analysis shows that sleep needs in patients hospitalized in <b>the</b> cardiologic <b>Intensive</b> <b>Care</b> Unit are not met. The most stressful factors are: the change of environment, monitor noisiness, lights switched on at night, uncomfortable beds and anxiety. The hypotheses were confirmed. The objectives of my thesis were accomplished. In the closing part of my thesis I suggest some solutions to improve patients´ feelings and meet their sleep needs, such as dim lights at night, turned down monitoring apparatuses alarm, patients activation during the day, a calming dialogue with the patient, bed making and airing the room before night. I also enclose some attachments treating the issue of sleep needs...|$|R
