5|$|The Pro-Line {{series was}} durable and fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used {{solid-state}} amplifiers, {{they are not}} as highly regarded as the older tube-based Leslies, because <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> characteristic sound when the amp is overdriven.|$|E

5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E

50|$|Belemnites were superficially squid-like. They possessed ten arms {{of equal}} length studded with small inward-curving hooks used for {{grasping}} prey. However, <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> pair of specialized tentacles present in modern squid.|$|R
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|Once Fletcher {{realizes that}} he has been used by Harlow's father, he teams with the Gunmen to help Harlow find the second bioterrorist. After a few false starts and chases, the Lone Gunmen corner the bioterrorist with only a few minutes before his virus is due to be released. They realize that <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> time to destroy his virus-filled organ and {{therefore}} pull a fire alarm, causing large emergency doors to seal shut, simultaneously containing the virus and entrapping them with it. Their sacrifice earns them a final resting place in Arlington National Cemetery, where Fletcher, John Doggett, Monica Reyes, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Harlow and Jimmy Bond (Stephen Snedden) pay their respects to them.|$|E
5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. <b>They</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{regulators}} and politicians unsuccessfully maintained {{the safety and}} soundness of the U. S. financial system not only because <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> proper tools but also because <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> proper incentives. While filling regulatory gaps and improving supervisory tools are worthwhile reforms, they do not address the core governance failure – the unwillingness of the policy apparatus {{to adapt to a}} dynamic, innovating financial system and act {{in the best interests of}} the public. I propose an auxiliary institution to act as a sentinel on behalf of the public to improve the design, interpretation, and implementation of financial regulations...|$|R

50|$|This was {{developed}} as an austere upgrade for two Gato-class and two Balao-class boats prior {{to transfer to}} foreign navies in 1953-55. <b>They</b> <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> sonar and electronics upgrades of other GUPPY conversions.|$|R
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. <b>They</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve well as <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, {{one from the}} Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius {{is one of}} a few lambeosaurines, {{along with}} Lambeosaurus lambei, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri and H. altispinus, to have had {{surviving}} fossilized juveniles assigned to it. Juveniles are harder to assign to species, because at a young age <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> distinctive larger crests of adults. As they age, lambeosaurine crests tend to grow and become more prominent come maturity. In the Dinosaur Park Formation, over fifty articulated specimens have been found, coming from many different genera. Among them, juveniles are hard to identify at the species level. Earlier, four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation's area, when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa. The smallest specimens were identified as Tetragonosaurus, now seen as a synonym of Procheneosaurus, and the largest skeletons were called either Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus; an adult was identified as Parasaurolophus. Small lambeosaurines from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation were referred to Cheneosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} over 600 addax in Europe, Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve (Israel), Sabratha (Libya), Giza Zoo (Egypt), North America, Japan and Australia under captive {{breeding}} programmes. There are 1000 more in private collections and ranches in United States and the Middle East. Addax is legally protected in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt. Although enormous reserves, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tasilli in Algeria, the Ténéré in Niger, the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad, and the newly established Wadi Howar National Park in Sudan, cover areas where addax previously occurred, some do not keep addax at present because <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> resources. The addax has been reintroduced in Bou-Hedma National Park (Tunisia) and Souss-Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (Tunisia) and Grand Erg Oriental (Sahara), and another is planned in Morocco.|$|E
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E

50|$|Reasons for loss: Despite {{the team}} {{generally}} getting decent-sized donations (even their lowest contributor, Dennis Rodman brought in $10,000), <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> big donors that Plan B had access to. As a result, they only raised $179,500.|$|R
50|$|Though the monarchist {{forces had}} {{superior}} numbers, <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> <b>the</b> supplies that the 100 regular soldiers brought {{and by the}} end of the attack, 30 monarchists were killed and the rest either fled into exile or were arrested.|$|R

25|$|MFCs operate well in mild conditions, 20°C to 40°C {{and also}} at pH of around 7. <b>They</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> {{stability}} required for long-term medical {{applications such as}} in pacemakers.|$|E
25|$|While VLocity {{carriages}} have tinted windows, <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> <b>the</b> curtains as {{provided by}} older V/Line rolling stock.

50|$|According to the Treatise the Macluritaceae {{includes}} two families, the Onychochilidae and Macluridae.
