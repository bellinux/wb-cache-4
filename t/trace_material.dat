40|$|Trajectory {{reconstruction}} of shooting incidents can help investigators determine critical case {{information regarding the}} number of shooters involved, their location(s), and intent. The examination of trace amounts of intermediate target materials collected {{on the surface of}} spent bullets provides crucial information needed for trajectory reconstruction. Determining the origin of an unknown material adhered to a spent bullet allows for the identification of intermediate targets the bullet either contacted or penetrated during flight. Although significant information can be obtained from examination of these trace materials adhered to spent bullets, this aspect of trajectory reconstruction is often ignored. 	The ability of different bullet types to collect trace materials from intermediate targets and the ability to associate these trace materials to their origin was examined using microscopy and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART). Full metal jacket (FMJ), jacketed hollow point (JHP), and lead round nose (LRN) bullets were fired into sheets of five different commonly used building materials (oriented strand board, sanded plywood, white melamine board, synthetic PVC board, and medium density fiberboard) to produce a total of 45 spent bullets to be examined. 	All spent bullets were examined and photographed using a DSLR camera paired with a stereomicroscope. The spent bullets were then examined using DART/MS to determine if any ion profiles generated from the trace materials could be associated with those of the intermediate target building materials which the bullets were fired through. 	The collection of <b>trace</b> <b>material</b> from all five types used was highly dependent on the type of bullet. Very minimal amounts of trace materials were observed on the majority of LRN bullets, which failed to produce an identifiable ion signature. The FMJ bullets that were fired through PVC material collected <b>trace</b> <b>material</b> that produced an ion profile, while all other building materials failed to transfer to the FMJ bullets. All JHP bullets collected significant amounts of the five building materials tested inside the hollow point cavity and along the nose of the bullet. In every spent JHP bullet sample, the <b>trace</b> <b>material</b> collected produced a unique ion profile. Additionally, MS data from four of the five building materials tested matched the MS data generated from <b>trace</b> <b>material</b> collected on JHP bullets from the respective target materials...|$|E

40|$|When {{forensic}} scientists {{evaluate and}} {{report on the}} probative strength of single DNA traces, they commonly rely on only one number, expressing the rarity of the DNA profile in the population of interest. This is so because {{the focus is on}} propositions regarding the source of the recovered <b>trace</b> <b>material,</b> such as ‘the person of interest {{is the source of the}} crime stain’. In particular, when the alternative proposition is ‘an unknown person is the source of the crime stain’, one is directed to think about the rarity of the profile. However, in the era of DNA profiling technology capable of producing results from small quantities of <b>trace</b> <b>material</b> (i. e., non-visible staining) that is subject to easy and ubiquitous modes of transfer, the issue of source is becoming less central, to the point that it is often not contested. There is now a shift from the question ‘whose DNA is this?’ to the question ‘how did it get there?’. As a consequence, recipients of expert information are now very much in need of assistance with the evaluation of the meaning and probative strength of DNA profiling results when the competing propositions of interest refer to different activities. This need is widely demonstrated in day-to-day forensic practice and is also voiced in specialized literature. Yet many forensic scientists remain reluctant to assess their results given propositions that relate to different activities. Some scientists consider evaluations beyond the issue of source as being overly speculative, because of the lack of relevant data and knowledge regarding phenomena and mechanisms of transfer, persistence and background of DNA. Similarly, encouragements to deal with these activity issues, expressed in a recently released European guideline on evaluative reporting 42, which highlights the need for rethinking current practice, are sometimes viewed skeptically or are not considered feasible. In this discussion paper, we select and discuss recurrent skeptical views brought to our attention, as well as some of the alternative solutions that have been suggested...|$|E

To identify important erosion and impurity source locations, we have vacuum plasma sprayed ~ 100 μm of boron (B) onto molybdenum (Mo) tiles. For ICRF heated H-modes, the core molybdenum levels have been significantly reduced and remained at low levels for increased injected RF energy.
