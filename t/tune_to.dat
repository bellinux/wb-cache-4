5|$|The theme <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> Neighbours was {{composed}} by Tony Hatch whose then wife, Jackie Trent, wrote the lyrics. Since 1985, {{there have been}} eight versions of the theme tune. Barry Crocker performed the song until 1992. The song has been voted the world's most recognised television theme song and the lyrics were quoted by John Smith, then British Shadow Chancellor, in a House of Commons debate on Government economic policy. From 2007, the theme <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> Neighbours was sung by Sandra de Jong. In February 2013, Network Ten and FremantleMedia announced that they were searching across Australia and the United Kingdom for a singer to record {{a new version of}} the theme tune. The competition resulted in a tie and the new theme was sung as a duet by Daniel Boys and Stephanie Angelini. That version of the theme tune began airing from 15 April 2013. A new retro-inspired theme tune sung by Garth Ploog debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 he {{recorded}} the theme <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> the Sky 1 sitcom After Hours.|$|E

25|$|While 19th-century musicologists disputed Luther's authorship of {{the music}} to the hymn, that opinion has been {{modified}} by more recent research; {{it is now the}} consensus view of musical scholars that Luther did indeed compose the famous <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> go with the words.|$|E

50|$|The {{strings of}} a guitar are {{normally}} <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> fourths (excepting the G and B strings in standard tuning, which are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> a third), {{as are the}} strings of the bass guitar and double bass. Violin, viola, and cello strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> fifths. However, non-standard tunings (called scordatura) exist to change {{the sound of the}} instrument or create other playing options.|$|R
25|$|The special song of Lampião's bandis {{thought by}} some to have been {{composed}} by Lampião, who {{is known to have}} played the accordion, but it seems more likely that it was a traditional <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> which the bandits added their own words.|$|E
25|$|Eric Coates (1886–1957) the English Composer {{lived and}} worked in Selsey. He was {{inspired}} to write By the Sleepy Lagoon after overlooking the sea towards Bognor Regis. His musical composition can be heard as the theme <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
25|$|Barry Devlin {{issued a}} solo album called Breaking Star Codes in 1983 with {{some help from}} Jim Lockhart. The album had 12 songs, each based, loosely, on {{the signs of the}} zodiac.

25|$|Other tunings exist, {{including}} cross-tunings, {{in which}} the usually doubled string runs are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> different pitches.

25|$|According to biographers of McCartney and the Beatles, McCartney {{composed}} the entire melody {{in a dream}} one night in his room at the Wimpole Street home of his then girlfriend Jane Asher and her family.

25|$|Accent or Faccent- This game {{involves}} three callers doing accents. Greg, Chris Smith or a guest {{must ask}} them three questions {{after which they}} must decide which caller(s) is/are doing a real accent (accent), and which are doing a fake accent (faccent). The theme tune is the theme <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> Keeping Up Appearances.|$|E
25|$|Buller (1905) {{mentions}} {{the testimony of}} a correspondent who claimed that laughing owls would be attracted by accordion play. Given that recorded vocalizations are an effective means to attract owls, and given the similarity of a distant accordion's <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> {{the call of the}} laughing owl as reported, it is apparent that the method might have worked.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} lowest pitched (7th) course is {{frequently}} <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> pitches other than 'C', at the player's discretion, {{to accommodate the}} music. The <b>tuning</b> <b>to</b> C is common, but not standard.|$|R
50|$|A {{preselector}} typically is <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> have {{a narrow}} bandwidth, {{centered on the}} receiver’s operating frequency. The preselector passes through the signal unchanged or only slightly reduced on the frequency that it is <b>tuned</b> <b>to,</b> but it diminishes or eliminates off-frequency signals, reducing or eliminating unwanted interference. However, a preselector does not remove interference on the same frequency that it and the receiver are both <b>tuned</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R

The popular Chabad-Lubavitch singer Avraham Fried has recorded a version of this song that has gained popularity, reflecting the Chabad-Lubavitch's emphasis on the imminent coming of the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|Modern lutenists <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> {{a variety}} of pitch standards, ranging from A = 392 to 470Hz, {{depending}} on the type of instrument they are playing, the repertory, the pitch of other instruments in an ensemble and other performing expediencies. No attempt at a universal pitch standard existed during the period of the lute's historical popularity. The standards varied over time and from place to place.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 1948, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain {{the rights of}} the independence and Nationalist movements in the island. The Senate, controlled by the PPD and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the Bill. The Bill, also known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law), made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic <b>tune,</b> <b>to</b> speak of independence, or to advocate for the liberation of the island - even if this speech or advocacy occurred in one's own living room.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} twin-neck {{configuration}} {{consists of two}} ten-string necks, the nearer <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> a C6 <b>tuning</b> and the other <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> an E9 <b>tuning.</b> An instrument of this configuration {{is known as a}} D-10.|$|R

25|$|Kurwenal {{has brought}} Tristan {{home to his}} castle at Kareol in Brittany. A {{shepherd}} pipes a mournful tune and asks if Tristan is awake. Kurwenal replies that only Isolde's arrival can save Tristan, and the shepherd offers to keep watch and claims that he will pipe a joyful <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> mark the arrival of any ship. Tristan awakes ("Die alte Weise – was weckt sie mich?") and laments his fate – to be, once again, in the false realm of daylight, once more driven by unceasing unquenchable yearning ("Wo ich erwacht' weilt ich nicht"). Tristan's sorrow ends when Kurwenal tells him that Isolde is on her way. Tristan, overjoyed, asks if her ship is in sight, but only a sorrowful tune from the shepherd's pipe is heard.|$|E

It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic <b>tune,</b> <b>to</b> talk of independence, or to fight for the liberation of the island. It resembled the anti-communist Smith Act, which was passed in the United States, and was signed into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero and became known as Ley 53 (Law 53).|$|E
25|$|The first voice {{broadcast}} of 2RN, the original radio callsign for Radio 1, {{took place on}} 14 November 1925 when Seamus Clandillon, the 2RN station director said, 'Seo Raidió 2RN, Baile Átha Cliath ag tástáil', Irish for 'This is Radio 2RN, Dublin calling'. Regular Irish radio-broadcasting began on 1 January 1926. Unfortunately, most Irish people could not receive 2RN's (1.5 kilowatt) signal. When faced with numerous complaints from Cork regarding the writers' inability to <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> the signal, Clandillon remarked in The Irish Radio Review, a magazine dedicated to the service, {{that they did not}} know how to operate their sets. 6CK was established in Cork in 1927; much of 6CK's output was simply a relay of the national service but it also had a significant input into the programmes of 2RN until it was closed down in the 1950s.|$|E
