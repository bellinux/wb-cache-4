2500|$|Through studies {{scientists}} believe that Onychodus was an ambush predator. John A. Long has suggested that Onychodus probably hid in the Devonian reefs, lunging at its prey as it swam by. A fossil specimen of Onychodus from Western Australia was found with a placoderm fish half its length logged in its throat. <b>This</b> <b>interesting</b> find was described and illustrated by Dr. John A. Long. The pectoral fins were strong enough for the animal to [...] "walk" [...] around the sea floor {{in search of a}} hiding place between coral colonies. The posterior dorsal fin was quite powerful, providing quick speed for capturing prey.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{predominantly}} {{not in a}} subtropical climate, some warmer-climate {{flora and}} fauna does reach well into Ohio. For instance, a number of trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in Ohio {{just north of the}} Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in {{much of the rest of}} the State. <b>This</b> <b>interesting</b> change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's common wall lizard, one of the few examples of permanent [...] "subtropical" [...] fauna in Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{considered}} livestock project languished, the HBC {{pushed for}} a renewal of its monopoly licence from the British Government, set to expire in 1841. Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company John Pelly highlighted to Secretary of the Colonies Lord Glenelg the benefits the British Empire had for decades received from the HBC in 1837. In this correspondence he promoted the considered, not still not active, livestock and farming operations in the Columbia Department. Once this venture began these ventures would, Pelly declared, maintain [...] "British interests and British influence... as paramount in <b>this</b> <b>interesting</b> part of the Coast of the Pacific." [...] The appeals of Pelly and his cohorts worked, for the HBC received another license in May 1838. The HBC was still only British enterprise only allowed to trade with native peoples west of Rupert's Land, and {{did not include the}} right to engage in commercial farming. However, like the previous license granted in 1821, the British Government stressed to not harass any American merchants in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908 the Swiss {{mountain}} dog appeared for {{the first}} time in public. At a show in Langenthal, Switzerland, Franz Schertenleib [...] a breeder of the Berner [...] showed an extraordinarily strong, short-haired Berner Sennenhund. He had seen this dog and bought him as an oddity. He was eager to hear what the Langenthal judge, Professor Heim, would say about this short-haired Berner. Bello vom Schlossgut was beautifully marked, [...] high, sturdy, and with attractive colors. Heim's first look saw the possibility of a new breed of Sennenhunde. He remembered having seen similar dogs in the 1860s in various parts of Switzerland. He said to Schertenleib, [...] "The dog belongs in a different category; he is too gorgeous and thoroughbred to push him aside as a poor example of a Berner. He is an example of the old-time, almost extinct, butcher dog." [...] Heim wrote in his judge’s notes: [...] "Bello is a marvelous, old Sennen (Butcher) hund of the large, almost extinct breed. Had he been entered under [...] "other breeds" [...] I would have recognized him as grossen Sennenhund and awarded him first prize with pleasure. Since he was entered among the Durrbachs, I cannot give <b>this</b> <b>interesting</b> dog more than second prize. This dog is out of place here." ...|$|E

[...] The memoir was a strong defense of Hoover and his tenure as Director and {{condemned}} the reaction to criticisms of the Bureau made in the 1970s by the Church Committee and civil libertarians. He also denounced the treatment of Bureau agents as criminals and said the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act of 1974 only served to interfere with government work and helped criminals. (The flavor of his criticisms is apparent with the very first words of the book: [...] "The Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact", Justice Robert H. Jackson's comment in his dissent to Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1 (1949)). The New York Times Book Review was highly critical of the book, saying Felt [...] "seeks to perpetuate a view of Hoover and the FBI that is no longer seriously peddled even on the backs of cereal boxes" [...] and contains [...] "a disturbing number of factual errors", sentiments echoed by Curt Gentry who said Felt was [...] "the keeper of the Hoover flame." ...|$|E
