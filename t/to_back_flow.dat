Water samples were obtained from three way syringes of seven randomly selected dental units. Patient's mouth rinse, tap water in each dental unit was also sampled. Standard plate count was used in judging sanitary condition of water microbiology. There was a growth of bacteria on blood agar plates in almost all samples which were obtained from various air/water syringes of selected units. Since all samples of tap water {{were found to be}} free of any microbial growth and the identified grown bacteria were pseudomonas species which are part of the oral flora, it was therefore, suggested that bactria 1 l contamination of water lines is due <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> or contiguous growth of the oral bacteria from the contaminated ends of dental handipieces and syringes.

40|$|Quantum Darwinism {{explains}} {{the emergence of}} a classical description of objects in terms of the creation of many redundant registers in an environment containing their classical information. This amplification phenomenon, where only classical information reaches the macroscopic observer and through which different observers can agree on the objective existence of such object, has been revived lately for several types of situations, successfully explaining classicality. We explore quantum Darwinism in the setting of an environment made of two level systems which are initially prepared in the ground state of the XX model, which exhibits different phases; we find that the different phases have different ability to redundantly acquire classical information about the system, being the "ferromagnetic phase" the only one able to complete quantum Darwinism. At the same time we relate this ability to how non-Markovian the system dynamics is, based on the interpretation that non-Markovian dynamics is associated <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> of information from environment to system, thus spoiling the information transfer needed for Darwinism. Finally, we explore mixing of bath registers by allowing a small interaction among them, finding that this spoils the stored information as previously found in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the development of protecting system for window. In detail, we tried to develop pollution preventing system of a glass, mirror, or camera lens. For this, the new method for efficient pollution prevention was designed and the characteristic evaluation for developing the system is partly performed. Formerly, the method using air purge is generally used for preventing the pollution of camera window. However, the conventional method often induces contaminations due <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> of air purging. These pollutants can be crucial damage to the camera window and peripheral materials especially in clean room condition. And the conventional method always requires air supply, therefore it is difficult to apply the method where air source can not be supplied such as traveling crane located at mountain altitudes. To solve above mentioned the problem, the efficient concept for preventing pollution of camera window is proposed in this research. Without air purging, we proposed the new method using repulsion induced by electrifying dirty or moisture to positive magnetic force with high-voltage charge and then injecting gas to the ITO(Indium Tin Oxide) coating window for generating positive ion. To sum up, in this research, we aim to develop an efficient pollution preventing system for camera window based on the new method through characteristic evaluation and stabilization of the designed system...|$|E

40|$|Oil field {{injection}} {{water was}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> from two wells at the Packard drill site in Los Angeles, Calif., and was sampled {{at various times}} to obtain information about the biomass, potential activity, and community structure of the microbiota in the reservoir formation and in the injection water. Biomass was greatest in water samples {{that came from the}} zone near the injection site and dropped off sharply in subsequent samples, which were assumed to come from zones farther away from the well. Samples obtained from near the well also had visible exopolysaccharide blankets, as seen in scanning electron microscopic preparations. In one of the wells that was sampled, rates of glucose or acetate incorporation into microbial lipids correlated with biomass; but in the other well, activities correlated with the sampling time (volume of water that back flowed). Transmission electron micrographs showed a diverse, gram-negative bacterial population in a variety of physiological states. The analysis of the phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid profiles of the samples revealed consistently large proportions of 18 : 1 ω 7 c fatty acids, indicating the presence of many anaerobes, facultative organisms, or both. Proportions of cyclopropyl fatty acids and ratios of trans/cis monoenoic compounds increased with the volume of water that back flowed (analogous with the distance into the formation), while the ratio of unsaturated/saturated compounds decreased, possibly indicating higher levels of stress or starvation in the microbial communities farthest from the injection well. Greater than 90 % of the total biomass was trapped on glass fiber filters, indicating that the microbiota were largely attached to particles or were clumped. These sampling techniques and analytical methods may prove useful in monitoring for problems with microbes (e. g., plugging) in waterflood operations and in the preparation of water injection wells for enhanced oil recovery by the use of microbes...|$|E

Transient weld pool shape and the distributions of temperature and velocity were calculated by a three-dimensional numerical model. The final weld bead shape and dimensions were obtained. Corresponding experiments were conducted and in good agreement with modeling predictions. Metallurgical characterizations were also performed on the experimental samples. It was found that due to the fast solidification of the weld pool after the termination of the welding arc, there is no time for the molten metal <b>to</b> <b>flow</b> <b>back</b> towards the weld pool center and close up the crater. Thus a crater was formed {{at the end of the}} weld bead. Solidification cracking was formed at the center of weld crater.

The die inlet, which is usually tapered over a very short distance, is responsible for a pressure rise due <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> of resin. A mathematical model was developed for back flow/pressure analysis in the tapered die inlet. The model was based on the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication applied to the thin outer viscous annulus layer. The effects of various parameters such as the resin viscosity, preform size, pull speed, and profile of the inlet taper were examined. The present model may be utilized to obtain the best die inlet shape and the process conditions to achieve maximum possible pressure rise in the die inlet...|$|R

40|$|Electromigration (EM) in a {{metal line}} is the {{phenomenon}} of flow of the metal atoms along the line. The flow {{is driven by the}} current of electrons and is also affected by the variation of chemical potential along the line. The replacement of atoms leads to a change in eigenstrain, which, in turn, alters the chemical potential. Since the chemical potential is very often dominated by a stress term, this <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> is very often attributed to the presence of a stress gradient. In microelectronic applications metal lines are usually subjected to the actions of large thermally induced eigenstrain even before the current is turned on.
