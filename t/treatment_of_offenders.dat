2500|$|Article 200 was {{purposeful}} to Ceaușescu {{regime in}} that, since 1970, it offered a pry to strengthen social control. These restrictions under the Penal Code were strictly unique to Romania {{and no other}} European country. The restrictions only included relationships and those who considered themselves homosexual were not punished but were instead considered as mentally ill. In the early 1990s, when gay rights activists, international human rights organizations, and the European Council started to press the Romanian government to decriminalize homosexuality and ensure equal rights for all citizens, the conservative political elites and the Orthodox Church claimed that sexual minorities {{did not exist in}} Romania prior to 1989 and that homosexuality was only an undesirable product of capitalism, a life style induced by the Western democracies, and {{not a part of the}} heteronormative Romanian culture. In 1995, Romania applied for EU membership. As of 1995, it was one of only three countries in Europe that still criminalized homosexuality. Due mainly to strong [...] international pressure, in 1996, the first paragraph of Article 200 was amended and only same-sex sexual activities performed in public or considered a source of public scandal were punished by the law. In 2000, Romania began EU accession negotiations and the country had to demonstrate progress in harmonizing its laws with the EU legislation. In particular, Romania had to prove that sexual minority human rights were not violated by the country's policies and legislation. And the possibility of eventual entry into the European Union had a powerful effect on legal change. In January 2001, Adrian Năstase government adopted the Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, which eliminated Art. 200 of the Penal Code and adjusted other articles referring to sex offenses to avoid discriminatory <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>offenders.</b> This ordinance came into force in January 2002, after President Ion Iliescu signed the new law.|$|E
