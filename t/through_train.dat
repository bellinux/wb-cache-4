On Sundays, trains run every twohours to Sheringham and Norwich. In 1997 a single daily <b>through</b> <b>train</b> to and from London Liverpool Street to Sheringham via Cromer was introduced; it was not heavily used and the service was consequently discontinued. All of these services are run by diesel multiple units Class 153, 156 or occasionally 170.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{the line}} {{had a single}} <b>through</b> <b>train</b> from Oslo to Bergen, with an {{additional}} summer express—with {{a limited number of}} stops. In addition, there were two additional trains from Hønefoss to Oslo. From 1 May 1912, a night train was also introduced and the same year mixed passenger and freight trains were introduced from Ål on the Bergen Line to Oslo. A station was opened at Viul on 16 August 1915, and another at Kistefoss on 1 October. Because of economic impact of World War I, the night train services was reduced to only twice a week from 20 May 1917 until 7 June 1919. In 1930, new stations were established at Kalvsjø, Gunstad, Bergerfoss and Hønen. During World War II from 1940 to 1945, the frequency was reduced to no more than one train per day. During parts of 1940, the Oslo–Bergen line was instead run via the Drammen and Randsfjord Lines. However, two local trains were kept on the route from Hønefoss to Roa.|$|E

The Humberlincs Executive, as the service was known, was operated by a HST125 unit, but was discontinued following the electrification of the East Coast Main Line. Passengers now have to change trains at Newark when travelling to and from London. However, the East Coast Main Line passes through the county and one can catch direct trains to London.|$|E
25|$|Grand Trunk Western's primary {{passenger}} trains were Maple Leaf, the International Limited, the Inter-City Limited and The LaSalle, which provided service between Chicago's Dearborn Station and Toronto Union Station. In 1967, GTW introduced The Mohawk as a fast <b>through</b> <b>train</b> between Chicago and Brush Street Station in Detroit.

25|$|A daily <b>through</b> <b>train</b> between Hamar and Trondheim was {{introduced}} {{with the opening}} of the line in 1877. It connected with a morning train and steamship departure from Oslo, and required an overnight stay in Koppang. The train stopped the following day at Røros for dinner, with arrival in Trondheim that evening. Parliament approved the first stage of the Dovre Line in 1875, opening between Eidsvoll and Hamar on 8 November 1880. This allowed a significant cut in travel time and from 1881 direct services were introduced, with travel times from Oslo to Trondheim at 24 hours and 15 minutes. At first this ran only during the summer, but from 1885 it ran all year. The cheaper trains with an overnight in Koppang continued to be run.|$|E
25|$|To {{meet the}} 366% {{increase}} by mid-1943 from pre-war levels in WWII related {{military and civilian}} passenger traffic, the consists on the again all-Pullman San Francisco Overland Limited ballooned {{to as many as}} 20 cars with service that also often ran in multiple daily sections. Chair car service returned to the Overland in 1946 and the consist became all lightweight streamlined cars by 1951. A dome-lounge car was also added by the SP on the train west of Ogden by 1955. In March 1952, toward the end of its existence as an independent <b>through</b> <b>train,</b> the San Francisco Overland carried Chicago–San Francisco sleepers, a New York–San Francisco sleeper conveyed on alternating days by the New York Central Railroad's Wolverine and the Pennsylvania Railroad's Pennsylvania Limited, and a summer-only sleeper for Yellowstone Park conveyed to the Idahoan at Green River, Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{with its}} long {{tradition}} of infrastructure investment, the project garnered widespread approval. In April the French National Assembly gave unanimous support and, in June 1987, after a public inquiry, the Senate gave unanimous support. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill {{took place in the}} House of Commons, and was carried by 94votes to 22. The Channel Tunnel Act gained Royal assent and passed into law in July. Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of regional Eurostar <b>through</b> <b>train</b> services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link was awarded.|$|E

25|$|The NY reached Middletown, New York, and leased the {{connecting}} Middletown, Unionville and Water Gap Railroad (MU), which reached the NJM at Hanford. The last stretch of construction from Hackensack to Jersey City completed the NJM in 1872. The first <b>through</b> <b>train</b> from Oswego to Jersey City operated on July 9, 1873. While {{the goals of}} the two partners had been reached, the Panic of 1873 caused financial ruin for both companies. The NY suspended lease payments, and the agreement was broken. The NY was reorganized as the New York, Ontario and Western Railway in 1879, and went its separate way. The NJM took over the lease of the MU as well. Unable to weather the financial storm, the NJM was put into receivership in 1875. In 1880, the NJM was reorganized as the New Jersey Midland Railroad (NJM), and attention was turned to the lucrative coal fields of eastern Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first <b>through</b> <b>train</b> from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

500|$|The Capitol Limited, {{in common}} with most name trains in the U.S. by the mid-1950s, {{suffered}} steadily declining patronage as the traveling public abandoned trains in favor of airplanes and the automobile. [...] The B gave up on competing with the Pennsylvania Railroad into New York, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958. Thereafter, the Capitol Limited operated between Washington and Chicago as a <b>through</b> <b>train,</b> with a few cars originating in Baltimore until 1966. Other B passenger trains were combined with the Capitol Limited: the Ambassador to Detroit and the formerly all-coach Columbian to Chicago. The combined train in the early 1960s had as many as 22 cars pulled by five locomotives.|$|E

It also features better acceleration and deceleration than its predecessors. With the change of schedules from 2 June 1985, this resulted in travel time between Røros and Hamar being reduced by one hour, a reduction of 25 minutes between Trondheim and Steinkjer, and a reduction of 50 minutes between Trondheim and Grong. At the same time, the schedules were changed for optimal correspondence, such as with the night train in Trondheim and departures from Trondheim Airport, Værnes.
