5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses Nvidia's PhysX software engine <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> realistic, dynamic {{interactions with}} the game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain additional snow or fog (which reacts to Batman moving through it); with PhysX disabled, the effects are lessened or absent.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{contact with}} fish hosts and firing {{of the polar}} capsules, the sporoplasm {{contained}} within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining.

5|$|Aston Martin Racing {{adapted the}} DB9 for sports car racing, {{producing}} the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3.

40|$|Introduction. The {{descent of}} the larynx is a hotly debated topic in the {{evolution}} of language.

5|$|Firewatch {{runs on the}} Unity game engine. Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that would be placed within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|Grazing Goat Pictures {{produced}} {{their first}} Hindi soap opera Jamai Raja starring Ravi Dubey Nia Sharma, Achint Kaur and Delnaz Paul.

5|$|The first Halo book, , {{sold more}} than 1,000,000 copies and {{prompted}} an extended agreement between Del Rey Books and Microsoft <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> Halo novels. William C.

5000|$|Such fees {{would be}} little more than a bailout for these broadcasters' {{allegedly}} poor financial management, i.e. buying expensive American programming or purchasing other media outlets, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>producing</b> <b>more</b> distinctive local or Canadian programming (the broadcasters have not directly responded to these claims, but historically, buying American programming has in fact been less expensive than producing Canadian programming).|$|R
5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and major record labels {{bid for the}} right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking. He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he {{wanted to be able to}} put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> than 100,000 records. Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's small size and artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise, received the rights to the album for free, and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate.|$|E
5000|$|... early tribal {{societies}} {{were mostly}} not oriented <b>to</b> <b>producing</b> <b>more</b> {{than they could}} actually use themselves, never mind maximising their production of output.

Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, {{except for the}} heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>more</b> than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the doctor-patient {{ratio in}} the state was 1:2,480 – which {{is lower than the}} World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommendation}} of 1 doctor to 600 patients.

Many doctors who once served under the government hospitals have decided to move to private hospitals instead because of the heavy workload with low salaries in government hospitals although private hospitals won't easily recruiting them with some applications have been turned down.
