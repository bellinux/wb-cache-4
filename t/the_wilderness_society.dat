5|$|Since its founding, <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> {{has helped}} pass many bills for {{preservation}} and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing {{a total of}} 109millionacres (421,000km2) to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent wilderness protection became a reality 25years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law on September 3, 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members of <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society.</b>|$|E
5|$|Defining {{wilderness}} as {{a social}} {{as well as an}} environmental ideal, Marshall promoted organization of a national group dedicated to the preservation of primeval land. In 1935, {{he was one of the}} principal founders of <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> and personally provided most of the Society's funding in its first years. He also supported socialism and civil liberties throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Bob Marshall's {{mother died}} of cancer in 1916. In 1929, his father Louis died in Zürich, Switzerland at the age of 72. The four {{children}} inherited most of their father's estate, which was worth several million dollars. Although Marshall became financially independent, he continued to work throughout his life. He used his wealth to support causes, such as <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> which he essentially supported in its early years, and to pursue his interests.|$|E

5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society</b> helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including <b>the</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{last years}} were productive. By May 1937, he was {{appointed}} {{as director of the}} Forest Service's Division of Recreation and Lands. Over the next two years, Marshall worked on two major initiatives: an effort to extend national forest recreational opportunities to people with lower incomes (as well as dismantling discriminatory barriers against ethnic minorities), and a program to preserve more wilderness within the national forests. His biographer James Glover asserts that Marshall was probably the first high-level official to seriously fight ethnic discrimination in Forest Service recreational policies, at a time when racial segregation of public facilities was law throughout the Southern states and in some other states. During this time, Marshall continued to financially support <b>The</b> <b>Wilderness</b> <b>Society,</b> as well as various civil rights, labor, and socialist organizations.|$|E
