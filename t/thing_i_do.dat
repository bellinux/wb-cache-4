He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit...

2500|$|Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged {{for about}} 25 months {{exclusively}} in American oak barrels. Silver Oak’s Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In {{answer to the}} question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak." [...] The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak’s specifications. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, produced at the Oakville Winery, is considered to be a wine of deep garnet color with a [...] "complex nose of black cherry, boysenberry, cassis, licorice, coffee and spice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pair bottled {{their first}} vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the {{wine in the}} old Keig Dairy barn on the {{original}} plot of land Duncan purchased. They {{made the decision to}} produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world, to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels. Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, [...] "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, {{and it was kind of}} in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. This is a pretty common concept in France." [...] According to noted wine critic Robert Parker, Meyer always believed in harvesting ripe, physiologically mature fruit. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees.

An art course prompted Residente {{to pursue a career}} as a multimedia designer, and Visitante became a full-time musician and producer. [...] Residente states that his degree in design has influenced his musical style: [...] "What I used to do with my visual art is the same <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now with my lyrics. [...] My songs are descriptive, very visual." [...] Besides this, Residente was a fan of what was then called [...] "underground rap" [...] in Puerto Rico, and started to earn a reputation as a lyricist (Residente says, with some embarrassment, that his moniker at the time was [...] "El Déspota", or [...] "The Despot"). Meanwhile, Visitante participated in Bayanga, a rock and Brazilian batucada group. [...] After Residente finished studying in Georgia at the Savannah College of Art and Design and earned a [...] master of fine arts in animation, illustration, sequential art and film, he returned to Puerto Rico. Soon after, both of them started working on their music. They claim they initially did it as a joke, but they still managed to get some of their songs heard throughout Puerto Rico. [...] They began recording music together in 2004, with the idea of hosting their work on a website, beginning with two demos ("La Tripleta" [...] and [...] "La Aguacatona"). [...] Within a year, the duo began looking for a record label to distribute their music commercially. [...] They decided to pursue a deal at White Lion Records, because Tego Calderón was on the label, whom the two admired.|$|E
2500|$|American media {{depictions of}} Poles have been {{historically}} negative. Fictional Polish-Americans include Barney Gumble, Moe Szyslak, Banacek, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Brock Samson, Walt Kowalski of Gran Torino, The Big Lebowski, and Polish Wedding. Polish characters {{tend to be}} brutish and ignorant, and are frequently the butt of jokes in the pecking order of the show. In the series Banacek, the main character was described as [...] "not only a rugged insurance sleuth but also a walking lightning rod for Polish jokes." [...] In the 1961 film West Side Story, the character Chino takes issue with the caucasian Tony, who is of mixed Polish and Swedish heritage, and has a line in which he said, [...] "If it's the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I'm gonna kill that Polack!" [...] The slurring of Tony's ancestry is unique in {{that none of the}} other white ancestries are targeted. Folklorist Mac E. Barrick observed that TV comedians were reluctant to tell ethnic jokes until Spiro Agnew's [...] "polack jokes" [...] in 1968, pointing to an early Polish joke told by comedian Bob Hope in 1968, referencing politicians. Barrick stated that [...] "even though the Polack joke usually lacks the bitterness found in racial humor, it deals deliberately with a very small minority group, one not involved in national controversy, and one that has no influential organization for picketing or protesting." [...] During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a revived expression of white ethnicity in American culture. The popular 1970s sitcom Barney Miller depicted Polish-American character Sergeant Wojohowicz as uneducated and mentally slow. Among the worst offenders was the popular 1970s sitcom All in the Family, where protagonist Archie Bunker routinely called his son-in-law a [...] "dumb Polack". The desensitization that was caused by the hateful language in All in the Family created a mainstream acceptance of the jokes, and the word Polack. Sociologist Barbara Ehrenreich called the show [...] "the longest-running Polish joke." [...] In the series Coach, character Dauber Dybinski played the [...] "big, dumb hulk of a player" [...] role for nine series, and a spin-off character George Dubcek (also with a Polish name) in Teech displayed the [...] "burly but dumb son of a former football player". In the movie The End, lead supporting actor Marlon Burunki is depicted as an oafish and schizophrenic Polish-American in a mental institution. The term Polack was so pervasive in American society through the 1960s and 1970s that high-ranking U.S. politicians followed suit. In 1978, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington made Polish jokes at a banquet. Ronald Reagan told Polish jokes multiple times during his presidential campaign in 1980 and during his presidency. As late as 2008, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania told Polish jokes to an audience of Republican supporters. Reportedly an audience member interrupted him, saying, [...] "Hey careful, I'm Polish", and Specter replied, [...] "That's ok, I'll tell it more slowly." [...] Mayor Marion Barry slurred Poles in 2012, and was apparently unaware the word Polacks was inappropriate.|$|E
