40|$|In {{this paper}} we address a problem arising in a {{manufacturing}} environment in which the owner of a machining resource, besides its own jobs, must process also jobs belonging to an external party. Due <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> <b>commitments,</b> the jobs of the external party must be processed within a certain due date, that can be considered as a deadline. Moreover, these jobs have a given release date corresponding to their actual availability in the manufacturing system. The external party jobs arrive with an estimate of their durations and the owner of the machining resource, when planning the schedule of its jobs, must take into account possible deviations from the nominal values of the external processing times. It is therefore important to determine a schedule which is robust to any possible changes in the durations of the external jobs. We consider the total completion time objective for the owner of the machining resource. However, due to the uncertainty on the external jobs processing times, we seek for a solution minimizing the maximum absolute deviation from an optimal schedule. We derive some properties of such robust schedules and evaluate the performance two mixed integer linear programming formulations...|$|E
40|$|CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH 2 M HILL) {{is pleased}} to {{nominate}} the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) project for the Project Management Institute's consideration as 2007 Project of the Year, Built for the U. S, Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of River Protection (ORP) at the Hanford Site, the IDF is the site's first Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) -compliant disposal facility. The IDF is important to DOE's waste management strategy for the site. Effective management of the IDF project contributed to the project's success. The project was carefully managed to meet three Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) milestones. The completed facility fully satisfied the needs and expectations of the client, regulators and stakeholders. Ultimately, the project, initially estimated to require 48 months and $ 33. 9 million to build, was completed four months ahead of schedule and $ 11. 1 million under budget. DOE directed construction of the IDF to provide additional capacity for disposing of low-level radioactive and mixed (i. e., radioactive and hazardous) solid waste. The facility needed to comply with federal and Washington State environmental laws and meet TPA milestones. The facility had to accommodate over one million cubic yards of the waste material, including immobilized low-activity waste packages from the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP), low-level and mixed low-level waste from WTP failed melters, and alternative immobilized low-activity waste forms, such as bulk-vitrified waste. CH 2 M HILL designed and constructed a disposal facility with a redundant system of containment barriers and a sophisticated leak-detection system. Built on a 168 -area, the facility's construction met all regulatory requirements. The facility's containment system actually exceeds the state's environmental requirements for a hazardous waste landfill. Effective management of the IDF construction project required working through highly political and legal issues as well as challenges with permitting, scheduling, costs, stakeholders and technical issues. To meet the customer's needs and deadlines, the project was managed with conscientious discipline and application of sound project management principles in the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge. Several factors contributed to project success. Extensive planning and preparation were conducted, which was instrumental to contract and procurement management. Anticipating issues and risks, CH 2 M HILL prepared well defined scope and expectations, particularly for safety. To ensure worker safety, the project management team incorporated CH 2 M HILL's Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) into the project and included safety requirements in contracting documents and baseline planning. The construction contractor DelHur Industries, Inc. adopted CH 2 M HILL's safety program to meet the procurement requirement for a comparable ISMS safety program. This project management approach contributed to an excellent safety record for a project with heavy equipment in constant motion and 63, 555 man-hours worked. The project manager worked closely with ORP and Ecology to keep them involved in project decisions and head off any stakeholder or regulatory concerns. As issues emerged, the project manager addressed them expeditiously to maintain a rigorous schedule. Subcontractors and project contributors were held <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> <b>commitments</b> for performance of the work scope and requirements for quality, budget and schedule. Another element of project success extended to early and continual involvement of all interested in the project scope. Due to the public sensitivity of constructing a landfill planned for radioactive waste as well as offsite waste, there were many stakeholders and {{it was important to}} secure their agreement on scope and time frames. The project had multiple participants involved in quality assurance surveillances, audits and inspections, including the construction contractor, CH 2 M HILL, ORP, the Washington State Department of Ecology, and independent certified quality assurance and engineering inspectors. A QA manager and safety manager were on-site during all project activities. Completion of the project provided a safe and reliable facility that will help DOE ORP meet the growing need for environmentally compliant, on-site disposal of solid waste generated in the cleanup project. Furthermore, the project helped DOE save money and meet TPA milestones ahead of schedule. In the following pages, we detail the tools and techniques used to manage the IDF project. We had a highly competent project management team. Their skillful management of the construction and the stakeholder and regulatory issues resulted in successful project outcomes and lessons learned. We believe their performance merits special recognition...|$|E

50|$|While it is {{challenging}} to define over-indebtedness, definitions of over-indebtedness {{tend to have}} a few core elements in common. The first one refers to the capacity to meet the expenses associated with the <b>contracted</b> financial <b>commitments.</b> Over-indebtedness implies an inability to meet such recurring expenses. Second, this inability is structural. This is the time dimension, which holds that the definition must capture persistent and ongoing financial problems and exclude one-off occurrences that arise due to forgetfulness, for instance. The third core element refers to standard of living. The household must be unable <b>to</b> meet <b>contracted</b> <b>commitments</b> without reducing its minimum standard of living expenses. Fourth, comes illiquidity. The household is unable to remedy the situation by recourse to (financial and non-financial) assets and other financial sources such as credit. Lastly, all <b>contracted</b> financial <b>commitments</b> are included, among them mortgage and consumer credit commitments, utility and telephone bills as well as rent payments (recurring expenses).|$|R

For hump-shaped endowment profiles, young individuals face endogenous debt constraints that ration current consumption. Changes in current and future yields affect these constraints, inducing an additional income effect on rationed household demand that makes current and future consumption complements. This mechanism can lead to multiple steady states, persistent indeterminacy and regime switching. We show that sensitivity to shocks and complex dynamic behaviour are consistent with endogenous debt limits but not with exogenous liquidity constraints.

How is entrepreneurship possible given these conflicting demands? In this article, the authors examine how partnership networks and reputation channel the mobilization of capital for new enterprises, using quantitative information on 4, 172 corporate partnerships during the industrialization of late imperial Russia (1869 – 1913). They find that reputation is locally effective in small and homogeneous network components. By contrast, founders in the largest components that form the network core raise more capital from investors but benefit less from reputation and more from brokerage opportunities and ties that reach diverse communities...|$|R

We then turn to {{the literature on}} intergenerational risk sharing, which suggests that a long-lived entity such as a pension fund or the government can yield ex ante welfare gains by allowing nonoverlapping generations to trade risk. The scope for this type of intergenerational risk sharing, however, is limited by the ability to commit generations <b>to</b> the <b>contract.</b> These <b>commitment</b> problems raise concerns with respect to sustainability and intergenerational fairness.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{study the}} role of limited commitment in dynamic models.

In the second part, I examine a dynamic investment model where firms invest in a risky asset but cannot hedge the risk of their investment because they lack the ability to commit to future repayments of debt. Once firms have access to exogenous supplies of risk free assets, they may on an aggregate level invest more in the risky asset, because risk free technology allows them to increase in wealth in equilibrium. This result helps to explain the asset price booms in emerging countries when they experience substantial capital outflow. i...|$|R

Enabling technologies include such features as web-based power system and price monitoring, control and dispatch of curtailable loads, communications and information systems links to program participants, availability of interval metering data to customers in near real time, and building/facility/end-use automation and management capabilities. Two state agencies - NYSERDA in New York and the CEC in California - have been conspicuous leaders in the demonstration of demand response (DR) programs utilizing enabling technologies. In partnership with key stakeholders in these two states (e. g., grid operator, state energy agencies, and program administrators), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) surveyed 56 customers who worked with five contractors participating in CEC or NYSERDA-sponsored DR programs. We combined market research and actual load curtailment data when available (i. e., New York) or customer load reduction targets in order to explore the relative importance of contractor's program design features, sophistication of control strategies, and reliance on enabling technologies in predicting customer's ability to deliver load reductions in DR programs targeted to large commercial/industrial customers. We found preliminary evidence that DR enabling technology has a positive effect on load curtailment potential. Many customers indicated that web-based energy information tools were useful for facilitating demand response (e. g., assessing actual performance compared <b>to</b> load reduction <b>contract</b> <b>commitments),</b> that multiple notification channels facilitated timely response, and that support for and use of backup generation allowed customers to achieve significant and ! predictable load curtailments. We also found that 60 - 70 percent of the customers relied on manual approaches to implementing load reductions/curtailments, rather than automated load control response.
