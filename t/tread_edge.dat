40|$|AbstractBackgroundFalls {{sustained}} when descending stairs are {{the leading}} cause of accidental death in older adults. Highly visible edge highlighters/friction strips (often set back from the <b>tread</b> <b>edge)</b> are sometimes used to improve stair safety, but there is no evidence for the usefulness of either. ObjectiveTo determine whether an edge highlighter and its location relative to the <b>tread</b> <b>edge</b> affect foot placement/clearance and accidental foot contacts when descending stairs. MethodSixteen older adults (mean± 1 SD age; 71 ± 7 years) with normal vision (experiment 1) and eight young adults (mean± 1 SD age; 24 ± 4 years) with visual impairment due to simulated age-related cataract (experiment 2) completed step descent trials during which a high contrast edge highlighter was either not present, placed flush with the <b>tread</b> <b>edge,</b> or set back from the edge by 10 mm or 30 mm. Foot placement/clearance and the number of accidental foot contacts were compared across conditions. ResultsIn experiment 1, a highlighter set back by 30 mm led to a reduction in final foot placement (p< 0. 001) and foot clearance (p< 0. 001) compared to a highlighter placed flush with the <b>tread</b> <b>edge,</b> and the percentage of foot clearances that were less than 5 mm increased from 2 % (abutting) to 17 % (away 30). In experiment 2, a highlighter placed flush with the <b>tread</b> <b>edge</b> led to a decrease in within-subject variability in final foot placement (p= 0. 004) and horizontal foot clearance (p= 0. 022), a decrease in descent duration (p= 0. 009), and a {{decrease in the number of}} low clearances (< 5 mm, from 8 % to 0 %) and the number of accidental foot contacts (15 % to 3 %) when compared to a <b>tread</b> <b>edge</b> with no highlighter present. ConclusionsChanges to foot clearance parameters as a result of highlighter presence and position suggest that stairs with high-contrast edge highlighters positioned flush with the <b>tread</b> <b>edge</b> will improve safety on stairs, particularly for those with age-related visual impairment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an evaluation}} of stairway designs featured in Architectural Record, a leading architectural professional journal, over a thirteen-year publication period (2000 to 2012). Images of stairways were classified as either hazard-free or hazard(s) -present using a hazard identification checklist, {{and the frequency of}} visible design hazards was tabulated. A total of 578 stairways were scanned in articles and advertisements, of which 78 (13. 5 %) were product advertisements. Sixty-one percent of the stairways had at least one visible design hazard including nearly half (47 %) in product advertisements. The three most common hazards in stairways were inadequate handrails (161, 27. 8 %), excessive length of stairway flights (74, 12. 8 %), and low visual contrast on <b>tread</b> <b>edges</b> (73, 12. 6 %). The high prevalence of stairway design hazards in the professional literature indicates a need for improved professional education and media attention to safe stairway design...|$|R

40|$|Background: Falls on stairs are {{a common}} and {{dangerous}} problem for older people. This series of studies evaluated whether or not selected changes to the appearance of stairs could make them safer for older people to negotiate. Objectives: To {{determine the effect of}} (1) a step edge highlighter and its position and (2) an optimised horizontal–vertical (H–V) visual illusion placed on a step riser on gait safety during stair descent and ascent. Design: A series of studies using a repeated measures, laboratory-based design, investigating gait control and safety in independently mobile older people. Setting: The University of Bradford Vision and Mobility Laboratory. Participants: Fit and healthy older people aged 60 years of age or more, independently mobile, reasonably active and with normal healthy eyes and corrected vision. Interventions: A step edge highlighter in a variety of offsets from the stair edge and an optimised H–V visual illusion placed on the stair riser. The H–V illusion was provided on a staircase by horizontal step edge highlighters on the <b>tread</b> <b>edges</b> and vertical stripes on the step risers. Main outcome measures: Gait parameters that are important for safe stepping in ascent and descent, measured using three-dimensional lower limb segmental kinematic data...|$|R

40|$|DE 19849793 C UPAB: 20000426 NOVELTY - An {{imaging device}} {{produces}} a 3 D {{representation of the}} surface, measuring curvature. Electronic smoothing eliminates irregularities. Differencing techniques and area comparisons establish irregularity exceeding set limits. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: The data extraction and smoothing unit includes a band pass filter. The lower frequency is selected to suppress curvature, the upper frequency is selected to smooth higher frequencies, without removing the irregularity of interest. A development includes two low pass filters and a subtracter. A non-linear filter is used for smoothing. Pixel artifacts are excluded (aliasing); singularities are excluded. The unit making comparative judgments is a two-dimensional median filter avoiding suppression of regions exceeding the predetermined area limit. Practical implementation includes a laser (13) and cylindrical lens (12) producing a flat beam (11) to light the surface. A matrix camera (14) measures the diffusely-reflected flat beam. Bulges, or neckings of the sidewalls are registered, rejecting hash from <b>tread</b> <b>edges</b> and shoulders. A controller relates camera framing frequency and tire speed, to obtain a given resolution. USE - To detect e. g. bulges and depressions in tire sidewalls, for quality inspection and control. ADVANTAGE - The method eliminates noise by filtering, which arises from the <b>edges</b> of the <b>tread,</b> whilst leaving lower-frequency bulge- or depression information intact. It removes its own noise, {{in the form of}} image aliasing and also ignores inevitable minor irregularities and roughness...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is likely}} that foveal {{information}} on treads provides important sensory cues for stair walking, it is unclear how gaze stabilization on treads contribute to gait control on stairs. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which (i) stair walking depends on foveal information on stepped treads, (ii) fixated treads correspond to future foot landing locations, and (iii) the distance looked ahead varies with stepping distance. Gaze and foot position was monitored from six healthy young adults when they ascended and descended a 10 tread long staircase, taking the stairs one or two treads at a time. The results showed that 55 - 68 % of the total fixation time was aimed at treads, and that <b>tread</b> <b>edges</b> were fixated more intensively during stair descent (69 % of the total time spent fixating treads) than during stair ascent (48 %). A substantial 28 - 34 % of the stepped treads was never fixated and, when the staircase was taken two treads a time, approximately 35 % of the fixated treads was never stepped on. Subjects fixated 3. 5 - 4. 5 treads ahead in both stepping conditions, but when the staircase was taken 2 treads a time, stepped treads were fixated shorter ahead (2. 7 - 2. 9 treads) than treads that were not stepped (3. 4 - 4. 1 treads). These results provide new insights into the visual control of stair walking, and suggest that the stabilization of gaze on treads is not used solely to guide foot placement, but may serve other purposes as well, e. g., to facilitate postural control on the staircase.

The two birds--Torrent-ouzel, and Lily-ouzel,--which we {{have been}} just describing, agree, you will observe, in {{delicate}} and singular use of their feet in the water; the torrent-ouzel holding itself mysteriously at the bottom; and the lily-ouzel, less mysteriously, but as skillfully, on the top (for I forgot to note, respecting this raft-walking, that the bird, however light, must be always careful not to <b>tread</b> on the <b>edges</b> of leaves, but in the middle, or, rather, as nearly as may be where they are set on the stalk; it would go in at once if it <b>trod</b> on the <b>edges).</b> But both the birds have the foot which is really characteristic of land, not water-birds; and especially of those land species that run well. Of the real action of the toes, either in running, or hopping, nothing is told us by the anatomists--(compare lecture on Robin, § 26); but I hope before long to get {{at some of the}} facts respecting the greater flexibility of the gripping and climbing feet, and elasticity of running ones; and to draw up something like a properly graduated scale of the length of the toes in proportion to that of the body.|$|R
50|$|Clinchers do {{have their}} advantages. Changing tires is much quicker since {{it does not}} involve a lengthy glueing and curing process so a rider can have a large {{selection}} of tires at their disposal. Until recently, clinchers also generally had more cutting <b>edge</b> <b>tread</b> patterns than the more traditional tubulars. Some enthusiasts even {{went as far as}} to send Michelin Mud tires (a popular clincher tire) to Dugast (a manufacturer of high end tubular tires) to have a modern tread pattern incorporated into a traditional tubular. However, since 2005 several tubular manufacturers have designed more modern style tread patterns, namely Dugast with its Rhino, Tufo with its Flexus and Challenge with its Grifo and Fango. Lastly, clincher tires generally cost less than tubulars.|$|R
