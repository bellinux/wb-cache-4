25|$|The {{first edition}} of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, {{published}} in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only. Those were not sold, however, but {{at the expense of}} Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland. In <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature. These stories and poems were in fact something entirely different from what the readers were used to, not only as to what language they were witten in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. The copies of the booklet often were shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and not seldom the stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.|$|E

Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> replied; [...] "I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Willoughby's {{wardrobe}} {{was designed}} to reflect his [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "fashionable" [...] nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular {{kind of things that}} were on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E
500|$|Jean {{initially}} makes progress, and earns a small {{profit from}} his rabbit farm. In the long run, getting water proves a problem, and dragging {{it all the}} way from the distant spring becomes a backbreaking experience. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but is met only with vague excuses. Then, when the rain does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. Jean loudly berates God, whom he thinks has already given him enough trouble by deforming him. Later, the dusty winds of the sirocco also arrive, bringing the farm to near-catastrophe. Jean is undeterred, and decides to dig a well. At this point Ugolin sees it fitting to try and convince Jean that his project is hopeless, and that he might be better off selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. Jean has no intention of leaving though, but wants to use the value of the property to take up a mortgage of half that sum. Ugolin is not happy, but Papet again sees opportunity: he will himself grant the mortgage; <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> will either earn the interest, or drive Jean away for good. From the money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock and falls into the cavity. At first the injuries seem minor, but it turns out his spine is fractured and when the doctor arrives he declares Jean dead. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he's crying. [...] "It is not me who's crying," [...] he responds, [...] "it's my eyes".|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{stellite}} as a {{far more}} valuable metal, he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded the Haynes Stellite Company in Kokomo to produce the metal in September 1912. Many of his initial requests for the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the best for surgical tools. Because his company could not produce enough of the metal to satisfy demand, Haynes issued licenses to several companies in the United States, Canada, and Europe to produce the alloy and pay him royalties. Haynes strictly controlled production, and did not permit the other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form, but to only sell it as specific finished products. In <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> remained the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal. As World War I broke out, his company received large government contracts {{for use of the}} material. Stellite was found to have excellent applications in airplanes, and because it was non-corrosive and could protect its contents indefinitely, it proved to be the best metal available for ammunition casing. In 1916 alone, the company registered $1.3million in sales. The rapid growth of the business made Haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year. Despite his large income, he refused to provide his employees a year-end bonus, causing a significant stir in the factory. When a foreman demanded to know the reason that their wages were not raised, he told him, [...] "It doesn't pay to give the working man too much moneyit makes him too independent." [...] His statement was widely repeated and, although he claimed to have made it in jest, it alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor problems.|$|E

500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E

2500|$|Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James {{had died}} in 1918 so a deepened {{friendship}} between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek. Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937. [...] "In the fall of 1937, I turned back 6,200 head of Sugar Bowl cattle. Ed Brass was dead, E.P. Meyers and Frank Wagoner were gone and the big Brass and Meyers deal was about over. We had 3,000 cows, 25,000 acres of the Spade and all I had to wonder was could I ever pay for it. Ed Brass was a great teacher and cowman. I tried to do everything <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> taught me, and I owe him a lot." [...] Bixby said. By 1940 Bixby {{had been able to}} regain 40 square miles (100 km2) of original Spade Ranch range, including the home valley headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|The Armenian chronicler Hethum (Hayton) of Korykos {{referred}} to the Golden Horde Khanate as [...] "Comania". The Moroccan traveler, Ibn Batutta (1304- 1369), said of Cumania: [...] "This wilderness is green and grassy with no trees, nor hills, high or low...there is no means of travelling in this desert except in wagons." [...] The Persian historian, Hamdallah Mustawfi (1281–1349), wrote that Cumania has a cold climate {{and that it has}} excellent pasturage and numerous cattle and horses. The 14th-century Travels of Sir John Mandeville, note that Cumania [...] "is one of the great kingdoms in the world, but it is not all inhabited.
