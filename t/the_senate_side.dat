5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side,</b> from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E
25|$|Each {{major party}} has Hill {{committees}} that work {{to support its}} candidates for the House and Senate, chiefly by providing funds. On <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side,</b> the committees are the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).|$|E
25|$|The Capitol has a {{long history}} in art of the United States, {{beginning}} in 1856 with Italian/Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side</b> of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors, reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St. Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger shuttle crew.|$|E

50|$|Upon the army's {{return to}} Rome, the class {{tensions}} were reignited when Servilius' colleague Appius issued decrees {{for even more}} serious penalties regarding debts. <b>The</b> <b>senate</b> <b>sided</b> with Appius and the people were angered at Servilius since his promises of debt relief prior to the war went unfulfilled. Servilius was thereby in effect politically isolated and disliked by all, and remained so for the balance of his consulate.|$|R
50|$|Octavian's {{colleague}} in {{the consulate}} that year, his cousin (and nephew of Caesar), Quintus Pedius, died before the proscriptions got underway. Octavian himself resigned shortly after, allowing {{the appointment of}} a second pair of suffect consuls; the original consuls for the year, Caesar's legate Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus, had died fighting on <b>the</b> <b>Senate's</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> first civil war to follow Caesar's death, that between <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and Mark Antony himself. This became a broad pattern of the Triumvirate's two terms; during the ten years of the Triumvirate (43 BC TO 33 BC), there were 42 consuls in office, rather than the expected 20.|$|R
25|$|During 1962 Hayden came to {{national}} attention {{due to a}} dispute over procedural issues between the Senate Appropriations committee and House Appropriations Committee. Billed in the press as a feud between two octogenarian chairmen, Hayden and Representative Clarence Cannon, the dispute began {{over the issue of}} where conference committees to resolve appropriation issues would meet. The Constitution required that all appropriations bills must originate in the House while long-standing tradition of the time held that conference committee meetings occurred on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side</b> of the United States Capitol with a senator chairing the committee. The dispute began in January 1962 when members of the House appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for the meeting location of the conference committee to be evenly split between the House and Senate side of the Capitol building. In response to this, the Senate appropriations committee passed a resolution calling for half of all appropriations bills to originate in the Senate. By April, Hayden had arranged for a meeting room located midway between the two chambers but House members refused to discuss the issue face-to-face until July, when US$55billion in unapproved appropriations bill threatened to force a government shutdown.|$|E
2500|$|They are {{enclosed}} by hedges and were planted with trees. [...] In both cases they {{were divided into}} four quadrants, with two being occupied by rose gardens and the remaining two by recreational facilities. [...] On <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side</b> these are tennis courts and a cricket pitch and on the Representatives' side, they are tennis courts and a bowling/croquet green. In the 1970s much of the Representatives' gardens were covered by an extension to the building, but this has now been removed and the gardens restored.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interiors}} of the 1972–73 extensions reflect fashions of the time, although wooden panelling {{was used for}} the walls, in keeping with the older parts of the building, but with an unequivocally 1970s style. [...] On the Representatives side, the extensions necessitated the demolition of the Prime Minister's suite of offices (originally intended for the Speaker) and the original Cabinet Room. [...] The rooms are now left in the condition they were in at the time they were occupied by Bob Hawke, immediately prior to the move to New Parliament House in May 1988. [...] Similar extensions were made on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side,</b> with a new suite of rooms being constructed for the President of the Senate in a similar style.|$|E
5000|$|Bankston {{compiled}} a largely progressive voting record in <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>siding</b> almost {{always with the}} positions of Edwin Washington Edwards, Victor Bussie and Planned Parenthood, amongst other individuals and organizations. He was a supporter of casino gambling, abortion rights, and the repeal of right-to-work laws. Prior to 1992, he was a floor leader for Governor Buddy Roemer. Facing legal troubles, [...] Bankston did not seek a third term in the 1995 primary, and the seat was won by Democrat Wilson Fields, brother of then-U.S. Representative Cleo Fields, an African American who ran for governor in 1995 but was defeated by Mike Foster.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> Australian <b>Senate,</b> a {{procedure}} {{similar to that}} of the House of Representatives is followed. The voice vote is taken, and, if two Senators object, a division is held. Senators take seats in the right or left of the Chamber as in the House, and the President of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> appoints one teller for each side to record the votes. The President may vote by stating to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> on which he intends to vote. If the result of the division is an equality of votes, then the motion is in all cases disagreed to.|$|R
2500|$|There {{were also}} Roman Emperors from the Province of Africa. In 238 local proprietors rose in revolt, arming their clients and {{agricultural}} tenants who entered Thysdrus (modern El Djem) where they killed their target, a rapacious official and his bodyguards. In open revolt, they then proclaimed as co-emperors the aged Governor of the Province of Africa, Gordian I (c. 159–238), and his son, Gordian II (192–238). Gordian I had served at Rome in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and as Consul, {{and had been}} the Governor of various provinces. The very unpopular current Emperor Maximinus Thrax (who had succeeded the dynasty of Severus) was campaigning on the middle Danube. In Rome <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>sided</b> with <b>the</b> insurgents of Thysdrus. When the African revolt collapsed under an assault by local forces still loyal to <b>the</b> emperor, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> elected two of their number, Balbinus and Pupienus, as co-emperors. Then Maximus Thrax was killed by his disaffected soldiers. Eventually the grandson of Gordian I, Gordian III (225–244), of the Province of Africa, became the Emperor of the Romans, 238–244. [...] He died on the Persian frontier. His successor was Philip the Arab.|$|R

5000|$|On {{either side}} of the {{building}} are situated the Parliamentary Gardens - one each for the House of Representatives (eastern <b>side)</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> (western <b>side)</b> - which Murdoch intended as integral elements of the building, to provide both diversion and contemplative space for members and senators. The gardens were neglected for a period after the building was vacated by the parliament in 1988. After restoration, they were officially reopened to the public in 2004, now known as the National Rose Garden. (More detail is provided in the Gardens section below.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Whips {{also play}} a central role in voting. During each vote (or [...] "division"), whips ensure that their fellow party members are present and seated on the correct side of the house while votes are counted. Acting as tellers, the whips also count the votes. In a typical vote in the House of Representatives, where the Government and Opposition are on {{opposite}} sides, each will provide two tellers. One Government whip and one Opposition whip will count the votes in favour of the motion, and the other two will count the votes against. In <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> each <b>side</b> provides one whip.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, {{both of the}} Connecticut delegation, {{created a}} {{compromise}} that, in a sense, blended the Virginia (large-state) and New Jersey (small-state) proposals regarding congressional apportionment. Ultimately, however, its main contribution was in determining the apportionment of <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Sherman <b>sided</b> with <b>the</b> two-house national legislature of the Virginia Plan but proposed [...] "That the proportion of suffrage in the 1st. Branch house should be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants; {{and that in the}} second branch or Senate, each State should have one vote and no more." [...] Although Sherman was well liked and respected among the delegates, his plan failed at first. It was not until July 23 that representation was finally settled.|$|R

Later, however, he restored to the children of Hypatius and Pompeius and to all others the titles which they had formerly held, and as much of their property as he had not happened to bestow upon his friends. The execution is confirmed by Marcellinus Comes, Zacharias Rhetor, Evagrius Scholasticus, John Malalas, the Chronicon Paschale, Victor of Tunnuna, Theophanes the Confessor, and Joannes Zonaras.|$|R

The numerals, minute marks, hands, inner frame and profiled outer frame are all made out of fire gilded brass. On the courtyard side the clock face with a code name east clock face/VN 2 was initially made of wood and presumably tarred or painted in black. Later, it was replaced with a painted iron plate. The wooden face was found during restoration works under the iron face {{and it is still}} there after restoration. The outer frame of the east face was covered with a flat brass profile sometime before 1997. Kello ja Kulta Widemark (Ltd) has been responsible for the regular maintenance of the tower clock since 1919. Worn machinery parts have been replaced as needed over the decades, but the clock faces were never removed until 2010, when the second weight rope broke. This resulted in a restoration project of both clock faces, their frames and machinery.|$|R

50|$|McPherson {{served as}} {{assistant}} general counsel (1956-1959), associate counsel (1959-1961) {{and general counsel}} (1961-1963) to the Democratic Policy Committee, the Democratic Party’s key legislative policy organ on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>side.</b> His duties included summarizing bills coming before the Senate {{for members of the}} Calendar Committee. An outspoken advocate for civil rights, he helped draft legislation that became the Civil Rights Act of 1957, whose goal was to ensure that all African Americans could exercise their right to vote.

Military historian Desmond Morton stated, [...] "As the McKennas' critics discovered, {{one of the most difficult}} things to do in a free society is to criticize the media...Anyone criticizing the media will find them judge, jury, and defence lawyer in their own case." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> sub-committee ultimately <b>sided</b> with the veterans' complaints against the filmmakers.
