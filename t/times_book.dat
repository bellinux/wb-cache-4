5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> Review {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel.

Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E

The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trials of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost after a reading of De Profundis refuted his claims.|$|E
