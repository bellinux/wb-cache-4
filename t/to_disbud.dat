40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of oromucosal {{detomidine}} gel administered sublingually to calves prior <b>to</b> <b>disbudding,</b> and <b>to</b> compare its efficacy with intravenously administered detomidine. Study design: Randomised, prospective clinical study. Animals: Twenty dairy calves aged 12. 4 ± 4. 4 days (mean ± SD), weight 50. 5 ± 9. 0 kg. Methods: Detomidine at 80 μg kg- 1 was administered to ten calves sublingually (GEL) and at 30 μg kg- 1 to ten control calves intravenously (IV). Meloxicam (0. 5 mg kg- 1) and  local anaesthetic (lidocaine 3 mg kg- 1) were administered before heat cauterization of horn buds. Heart rate (HR), body temperature and clinical sedation were monitored over   240 minutes. Blood was collected during the same period for drug concentration  analysis. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated from the plasma detomidine  concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods.  Results: The maximum plasma detomidine concentration after GEL was 2. 1 ± 1. 2 ng  mL- 1 (mean ± SD) and the time of maximum concentration was 66. 0 ± 36. 9 minutes. The bioavailability of detomidine was approximately 34 % with GEL. Similar sedation  scores were reached in both groups after administration of detomidine, but maximal sedation was reached earlier in the IV group (10 minutes) than in the GEL group (40  minutes). HR was lower after IV than GEL from 5 to 10 minutes after administration. All animals were adequately sedated, {{and we were able to}} administer local anaesthetic without resistance to all of the calves before disbudding.

30|$|Based on {{quantitative}} and application studies of phytohormones, {{indole acetic acid}} (IAA) has been believed {{to be one of}} important regulators for tracheid formation. It was reported that trees with higher growth rates had greater endogenous IAA amounts [7], and the application of exogenous IAA <b>to</b> <b>disbudded</b> segments increased the endogenous IAA amounts and the number of lignified tracheids in a dose-dependent manner [8]. The application of auxin to a young red pine (Pinus resinosa) producing latewood tracheids induced the formation of earlywood [9]. However, based on the other studies of tracheid differentiation, other internal factors besides the decrease in the IAA amounts may control the differentiation of tracheids. Tracheid production in response to the application of IAA decreased with cambial age in Pinus sylvestris [10]. The transition from earlywood to latewood occurred concurrently with the decrease in IAA amounts in cambial region tissues; however, it occurred at different IAA amounts for different stem positions and different trees in Pinus densiflora [11]. The IAA amounts did not change with latewood initiation in P. sylvestris [12].|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out to {{describe}} the extent and current practice of cattle disbudding/dehorning in the EU Member States. Disbudding was defined as removal of horns in calves of up to 2 months of age, whereas dehorning was defined as removal of horns in older animals. Specific questionnaires were created regarding dairy, beef, and suckler production systems and they were submitted to local experts of each country belonging to relevant institutions like universities, national farmers' associations, cattle breeders associations, farm veterinarians and practitioners. Figures on disbudding/dehorning practices were produced for each production system for both the whole European Union and the North, Centre, East and South EU macro-regions. A total of 652 questionnaires were collected and 64 %, 24 % and 12 % of them related to dairy cattle, beef cattle and suckler cows, respectively. Data from the survey showed that in Europe, 81 % of the dairy, 47 % of the beef and 68 % of the suckler currently keep disbudded/dehorned animals, while the prevalence of polled cattle is rather low, especially in the dairy cattle sector (5 % of all cattle farms; < 1 % of dairy farms). Regardless of production system, prevalence of dehorned animals is {{the highest in the}} North macro-region. Polled cattle farms are almost exclusively located in the North where polled beef breeds are raised for fattening. Dehorning is performed primarily on loose housed cattle {{to reduce the risk of}} injuries for herdmates and the stockman. Dehorning is less frequently performed in organic farms. As method of horns removal, disbudding is generally preferred over surgical removal of the horns in older cattle. Hot-iron is the most used disbudding method especially in the North and Centre. Use of caustic paste is reported more frequently in the South and the East. In the large majority of EU farms, the stockman is the person in charge for disbudding and some kind of medication for pain relief is administered to the animals only in a small percentage of farms (< 30 %). Surgical dehorning of more aged cattle is mainly performed with the wire/saw method. Compared <b>to</b> <b>disbudding,</b> it is more often carried out by a veterinarian and pre- and post operative medications (44 % farms) is also more common...|$|R
40|$|Calf {{dehorning}} is {{a routine}} husbandry practice on dairy farms that is justified by safety reasons for stockpersons {{and by a}} reduced risk of injures among herdmates. In Europe, the practice is regulated by law but {{little is known about}} the methods applied or about farmers' attitude to the practice. This study aimed to broaden the existing information on dehorning in dairy holdings by processing results of 639 farm questionnaires gathered in a traditional dairy area of northeastern Italy. Farm questionnaires were stratified according to herd size, type of housing, and productive purpose of the predominant reared breed(s). Chi-squared tests were performed to verify the significant association between a given practice or opinion and the 3 classification factors, and odd ratios were calculated. The outcomes of the study showed that dehorning was carried out on 80 % of the surveyed farms, and disbudding was the method reported by all the interviewed farmers. Hotiron cauterization was the preferred method for disbudding (91 %). On average, disbudding was performed at 32 d of age and it was more likely in farms with >= 60 cows than in smaller dairy holdings (OR = 7. 3). The practice was carried out mainly by farm personnel, but the intervention of a veterinarian was far more likely (OR = 5. 98) on farms with = 6 h) but pain management was rare. Only 10 % of the farmers used local anesthesia before cauterization, and 5 % of the farmers provided calves with postoperative analgesia. Consistent with these results, farmers indicated limited willingness to pay the cost of analgesia or to call a veterinarian to perform the procedure. This low motivation of the respondents toward the adoption of practices able to reduce pain related <b>to</b> <b>disbudding</b> might arise from their insufficient knowledge on long-term negative effects of early painful experiences on behavior and handling of dairy heifers. Farmers in favor of keeping horned cows were asked about the reasons for not carrying out dehorning. Aesthetic motivations (54 % of respondents) and lack of time (24 %) were the main reasons cited. Moreover, a large majority of these respondents (74 %) reported no difficulty in handling horned cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} human–animal {{interactions}} {{is an important}} factor contributing to animal welfare and productivity. Reducing stress during routine husbandry procedures is likely to improve animal welfare. We examined how the type of early handling of calves affected responses to two common husbandry procedures, ear-tagging and disbudding. Forty Holstein–Friesian calves (n = 20 /treatment) were exposed to one of two handling treatments daily from 1 to 5 weeks of age: (1) positive (n = 20), involving gentle handling (soft voices, slow movements, patting), and (2) negative (n = 20), involving rough handling (rough voices, rapid movements, pushing). Heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and behaviour (activity, tail flicking) were measured before and after ear-tagging and disbudding (2 days apart). Cortisol was measured at − 20 (baseline), 20 and 40 min relative <b>to</b> <b>disbudding</b> time. There were no significant treatment differences in HR, RR or behaviour in response to either procedure. However, the following changes occurred across both treatment groups. HR increased after disbudding (by 14. 7 ± 4. 0 and 18. 6 ± 3. 8 bpm, positive and negative, respectively; mean ± s. e. m.) and ear-tagging (by 8. 7 ± 3. 1 and 10. 3 ± 3. 0 bpm, positive and negative, respectively). After disbudding, there was an increase in RR (by 8. 2 ± 3. 4 and 9. 3 ± 3. 4 breaths/min, positive and negative, respectively), overall activity (by 9. 4 ± 1. 2 and 9. 9 ± 1. 3 frequency/min, positive and negative, respectively) and tail flicking (by 13. 2 ± 2. 8 and 11. 2 ± 3. 0 frequency/min, positive and negative, respectively), and cortisol increased from baseline at 20 min post procedure (by 10. 3 ± 1. 1 and 12. 3 ± 1. 1 nmol/l positive and negative, respectively). Although we recorded significant changes in calf responses during ear-tagging and disbudding, the type of prior handling had no effect on responses. The effects of handling may have been overridden by the degree of pain and/or stress associated with the procedures. Further research is warranted to understand the welfare impact and interaction between previous handling and responses to husbandry procedures...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to disease}} and pain will prolong animal ‘suffering’, and as such, diminishes welfare. Identifying {{behaviours}} indicative {{of these conditions}} can facilitate early detection, timely treatment and improved welfare. Contributing {{to the problem of}} disease and pain detection in calves is the innate tendency of these animals to mask behavioural signs of vulnerability (stoicism), and the extensive use of group-housing systems. Existing technology was used in my research to obtain objective measures of behaviour in response to disease and pain. The goal of this thesis was to explore these key aspects of calf welfare: The work reported in Chapter 2 investigated a naturally occurring disease (neonatal calf diarrhoea complex) in pre-weaned calves to assess whether changes in milk-feeding and lying behaviours could be used for early disease detection. Calves were observed for a three week period, starting when they were four days old. Data on milk feeding and lying behaviours were obtained using automated milk-feeders and HOBO data loggers respectively. Lying postures were analysed from daily video footage at five minute intervals between 10 : 00 - 14 : 00 (seven days per week). For statistical analysis, calves were classified as ‘sick’ (n= 21), or ‘not sick’ (n= 91). This thesis identified three feeding measures of interest for disease detection: 1) reduced milk consumption, 2) increased duration of visits to the milk feeder, and 3) sick calves were less likely to receive a rewarded visit compared to calves that were not sick. Sick calves increased the duration of lying bouts nearing time of illness; however, no difference was observed between sick calves and those that were not sick. Postural observations were not effective at predicting illness. The use of automated milk-feeders to detect disease in calves has been studied extensively overseas; to my knowledge, this is the first New Zealand study to use automated feeders for this purpose. The results {{of this study indicate that}} aspects of milk feeding behaviour can be used to detect diseased calves in group housing systems. The work reported in Chapter 3 used hot iron disbudding as a pain model to determine whether changes in milk-feeding and lying behaviours could be used to identify pain in calves less than 4 weeks of age. Data was obtained using automated feeders and HOBO data loggers respectively over three observation periods (pre-treatment, treatment day and post-treatment). Fifty-three calves (26. 5 ± 3. 5 days of age) were allocated to one of five treatment groups: hot iron disbudded with no analgesia (n= 11), disbudded with a local anaesthetic (LA, n= 11), disbudded with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID; n= 11), disbudded with NSAID and LA (n= 10), and SHAM calves (n= 11). Analysis of feeding behaviour revealed only one difference between all treatment groups; SHAM calves showed a greater number of visits to the milk feeder during the recovery period compared <b>to</b> <b>disbudded</b> animals. Feeding and lying behaviours in this study were considered to be insufficient measures of pain. The use of automated milk-feeders to detect pain in calves is limited, thus necessitating this research. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality and}} {{quantity}} of human-animal interactions are crucial to animal welfare, productivity and management of livestock on-farm. Forty Holstein Friesian calves, from one week of age, were exposed to experimental handling for five minutes twice daily for five weeks. Calves were allocated to either positive or negative handling treatments (n= 20 per treatment). Positive handling required handlers to slowly approach calves whilst using soft voices to encourage voluntary friendly interactions such as gentle pats. Negative handling consisted of continuous 45 second cycles of direct and indirect handling to discourage friendly interactions. Direct handling required handlers to use fast movements and harsh voices whilst forcibly moving animals around the pen. Indirect handling required handlers to stand in the pen, stare at the animals and tap a polyurethane pipe to make noise to maintain disturbance. Two other novel objects, a plastic bag and an empty water bottle filled with stones, were alternatively used each week to prevent habituation to the negative stimulus. At six weeks of age, all animals were subjected to three routine management procedures: restraint, ear tagging and disbudding, which occurred in stated order over a week period. There were no significant treatment differences between positive and negative groups for heart rate or heart rate variability (measured using Polar heart rate watches), eye temperature (measured using infrared thermography), respiration rates (measured visually), struggling behaviour, and plasma cortisol levels (measured during disbudding only). There were however within treatment differences in response to ear tagging, with an increase in heart rate (p less than 0. 01) post-ear tagging, and in response <b>to</b> <b>disbudding</b> with an increase in heart rate (p less than 0. 001), tail flicking(p less than 0. 001) and cortisol levels (p less than 0. 001). It was concluded that, under the conditions of this experiment, early handling does not affect the behavioural and physiological responses of calves to routine management procedures. In a follow up trial at three months of age, the initial 40 animals and 20 additional three month old minimally handled animals (controls) were assessed for ease of handling using a force test, which ranked the time and effort required to move animals individually into a crush, and an exit speed test which recorded the animals speed exiting the crush, after two minutes of restraint. There {{were no significant differences between}} positive, negative and minimally handled treatment groups for heart rate, respiration rates or behaviour in the crush. However, the minimally handled group did appear to be more fearful of humans, with a significantly quicker entry time (p less than 0. 05) into the crush than positive and negative treatment groups. There were no differences in entry scores for effort required to move the animals during the force test or for exit speeds. It was concluded that, under the conditions of the present experiment, initial early handling does not appear to cause long lasting effects on calves' behavioural and physiological responses to routine farm management procedures, but minimal contact with humans early in life may lead to a fear of humans later in life...|$|R
40|$|Pain is an {{important}} indicator of poor welfare of livestock. Despite this, pain has largely gone unrecognized in farm animals due to attitudes of producers and veterinarians, although they {{play a key role}} in monitoring and managing the perception of animal pain. Producer attitudes toward animal welfare influence livestock management and production. The aim was to quantify dairy producer attitudes to the painfulness of various cattle diseases and disbudding, a painful routine procedure performed on farm to ensure safer handling of cattle. A questionnaire on disbudding-related opinions and practices was sent to 1, 000 Finnish dairy producers (response rate: 45 %). Attitudes toward disbudding were gauged using a 5 -point Likert scale and attitudes to cattle pain scored on an 11 -point numerical rating scale. Principal components analysis was used to assess the loadings, which were further tested for differences between producer gender and housing systems with Mann-Whitney U-tests, and between herd milk yield, herd size, and age and work experience of producers with a Kruskal-Wallis test. Four main factors were identified: factor I (“taking disbudding pain seriously”), factor II (“sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases”), factor III (“ready to medicate calves myself”), and factor IV (“pro horns”). Female producers took disbudding pain more seriously, were more sensitive to pain caused to cattle by diseases, and were more ready <b>to</b> medicate <b>disbudded</b> calves than male producers. Producers with tie-stalls favored horns over producers with freestalls. Male producers with tie-stalls were sensitive to cattle pain and preferred horns over male producers with freestalls. Female producers with freestalls were more ready to medicate calves, but did not prefer horns more than female producers with tie-stalls. Taking disbudding seriously correlated with sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases. Producers with low-milk-yielding herds were less willing to medicate calves and more willing to keep cattle with horns than producers with higher-yielding herds. Older producers were more sensitive to cattle pain than middle-aged and younger producers. No effect was established for taking disbudding pain seriously: the pro-horn factor was associated with work experience, age, and herd size. Women rated pain higher and were more positive toward pain medication for animals than men. Maintaining horns are more important for producers with tie-stalls than for those with freestalls...|$|R
40|$|In {{this age}} of {{increasing}} awareness of animal welfare, the demand for scientific methods to quantify the welfare of animals maintained under different conditions and exposed to different husbandry procedures has also increased. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the acute distress involved in the procedures of tail docking and disbudding of Friesian dairy calves. Different methods of tail docking (rubber ring and docking iron) and disbudding (scoop and cautery), with or without the use of a local anaesthetic, have been assessed using changes in plasma cortisol concentration and some behavioural observation as indices of distress. The practical objectives were to provide advice on choice of method and on the benefits or otherwise of using local anaesthetic to alleviate the pain associated with these procedures. The innervation at the docking site of the bovine tail and the efficiency of two methods of local anaesthetic administration (epidural and ring block) in desensitising the tail were assessed. Epidural local anaesthetic was found to totally desensitise the entire tail whereas a ring block adminstration of local anaesthetic around the docking site only effectively desensitised an area immediately adjacent to the site of ring block administration. Hence, to ensure total loss of sensation in the tail, an epidural administration of the local anaesthetic was used in the tail docking experiments. Tail docking, with or without a local anaesthetic, most three to four month old Friesian dairy calves was found to be no more distressing than control handling and blood sampling using both plasma Cortisol concentration and behavioural indices of distress. However, there was a degree of between-animal variation in response - a small proportion of calves which received some treatments that were not expected to cause distress showed signs of mild distress. The reasons for these responses are unknown. <b>Disbudding</b> six <b>to</b> eight week old Friesian dairy calves with a scoop caused a marked distress response which lasted for about five and a half hours, whereas the alternative method, the cauterising iron, was only slightly more distressing than control handling and blood sampling during the first one hour after disbudding. Although administration of a local anaesthetic before scoop disbudding produced a marked reduction in plasma cortisol concentration during the first two hours after treatment there was little or no reduction in overall distress, as judged by plasma cortisol responses. However, prior administration of a local anaesthetic <b>to</b> calves <b>disbudded</b> by cautery effected a slight reduction in the distress response, decreasing it to near control levels. The practical advice on method for these husbandry practices would be for tail docking, continued use of the rubber ring if tail docking is deemed necessary at all, and for disbudding, cautery alone or with local anaesthetic, if practically viable, would be recommended...|$|R
