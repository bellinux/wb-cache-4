5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> and no means of retreat as he was {{deployed}} with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room <b>to</b> <b>maneuver,</b> would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little room <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfied {{that the}} General Assembly had not acted {{to shore up}} the state pension system, Beshear called a special {{legislative}} session for July 23, 2008, after House and Senate leaders informed him that they had reached an agreement on a plan after the regular legislative session's end. The session lasted five days, the minimum amount of time required <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> the bill through the legislative process.|$|E

5|$|Siboney sailed for France on 30 June; after {{delivering}} her {{troops at}} Brest on 12July, {{she returned to}} New York on 25July. She sailed again on 31July. Before arriving at Brest on 12August, she had <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> several times to evade possible submarine contacts. She arrived at New York on 22August and was given a two-week repair period.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers {{can take}} cover behind walls and {{objects in the}} {{environment}} to gain a measure of protection. Units can use suppressive fire to disadvantage enemies, and use active camouflage <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> around opponents. Cutscenes and dynamic camera movements emphasise particularly exciting gameplay moments, such as kill sequences and use of special abilities. The game includes some tactical role-playing elements, whereby the player's soldiers can gain new abilities as they survive more battles.|$|E
5|$|The Amador Valley Robotics Team, {{founded in}} 1999, {{is the first}} and only high school team to compete in the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Competition hosted by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). Each year, with a minimal amount of outside {{technical}} assistance, the team develops an AUV <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> an underwater obstacle course.|$|E

5|$|Flight Unlimited is a 1995 {{aerobatic}} flight simulator video game developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and <b>to</b> perform aerobatic <b>maneuvers.</b> They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns <b>to</b> <b>maneuvers</b> such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|R
5|$|The Koch {{index is}} the ratio between peak {{steering}} torque {{and the product}} of peak lean rate and forward speed. Large, touring motorcycles {{tend to have a}} high Koch index, sport motorcycles tend to have a medium Koch index, and scooters tend to have a low Koch index. It is easier <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> light scooters than heavy motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|The {{real purpose}} of Đôn asking for martial law was <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> troops in {{readiness}} for a coup, {{and he had}} no concrete plans to send the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and took the opportunity to discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas. Đính, the officer most trusted by the Ngô family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} plan formulated by General Phạm Văn Phú and his General Staff {{was made with}} the belief that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would stop and consolidate their territorial gains before they could go on the attack again. However, during the spring offensive of 1975, North Vietnamese commanders were more than willing <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> their units away from newly captured territories, in order to pursue retreating South Vietnamese units.|$|E
50|$|Kicktails are the upwards bent tips of a {{skateboard}} deck, today considered {{vital to}} a skateboard. The front kicktail is usually called the nose while the back kicktail {{is referred to}} as the tail.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} control scheme for {{improving}} multiple vehicles formation maneuvering. The advantage of this control scheme {{is that it makes}} it easy <b>to</b> prescribe formation <b>maneuvers,</b> has stability guarantees and adds a type of robustness <b>to</b> <b>maneuvering</b> formations through the use of group feedback. For moving multiple vehicles in formation the added advantages of this control scheme are explored through simulation and hardware results using wheeled mobile robots...|$|R

5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, {{bounding}} gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much {{more powerful than the}} legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
50|$|Some levels offer a {{different}} experience than straight enemy shooting. Including following a branching network of gates to sync {{back to the}} time dimension, and racing fast through a set of blockades. In certain encounters the player is advised to not shoot at all and stick <b>to</b> <b>maneuvering</b> and dodging hazards without engaging.|$|R

5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} {{within range of}} German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed to provide an escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Oribe, the Allied forces split into two groups, the plan being for one force <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> upriver and sweep down on Buenos Aires from Santa Fe, while the other would make a landing {{at the port of}} Buenos Aires itself. The first of these groups, was composed of Uruguayan and Argentine troops, along with the 1st Division of the Brazilian Army under Brigadier General Manuel Marques de Sousa (later the Count of Porto Alegre). It was initially based in the town of Colonia del Sacramento in the south of Uruguay across the Río de la Plata estuary from the city of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of the II Division, the US Navy {{destroyed}} the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. Diederichs detached Gefion to investigate the situation in Manila in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>maneuver</b> Germany into a position to secure colonial possessions in the Philippines, or even to obtain a German prince on the Philippine throne outright. In late March 1899, Gefion was sent to Kiaotschou in response to mistreatment of German missionaries there; Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Franz Grapow went ashore with a landing party of 132marines and artillerymen to punish the offenders.|$|E
5|$|The bowfin is an {{actinopterygii}} {{which means}} that the pectoral girdle is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function <b>to</b> <b>maneuver,</b> brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle.The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E
