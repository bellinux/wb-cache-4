5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he {{did well}} financially and his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{left his}} law {{practice}} in 1972 and formally joined American Financial Corporation, by now a $1 billion enterprise, as executive vice president. Keating became Lindner's {{person in charge}} of firing employees from newly acquired companies. Within business circles Keating gained a reputation for aggressiveness and arrogance. He <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> operational involvement in The Cincinnati Enquirer, the town's only morning newspaper. He interfered in editorial decisions, such as adding coverage to high school sports that he or Lindner's sons were involved in. The paper was then sold to a group including his brother, William, {{who had been a}} Republican congressman from Ohio's 1st congressional district in the early 1970s. Charles Keating was involved in American Financial's 1974 sale of Bantam Books, and its decision that year not to enter the investment banking field.|$|E
5|$|The remnant trough {{proceeded}} northwestward {{into the}} Bahamas, where the NHC assessed a high chance of redevelopment based on relenting upper wind shear. Over {{the next couple}} of days, it moved over the Bahamas and proceeded east of southern Florida. Late on August6, the trough developed a new center of circulation and regenerated into a weak tropical depression by 1800UTC near Grand Bahama. Emily briefly reattained tropical storm strength six hours later, although it once again dissipated to a remnant low the next day owing to increasing wind shear. The low <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> accelerated east-northeastward motion, bypassing Bermuda before heading eastward over the open Atlantic. It briefly retained a broad area of gale-force winds with deep convection, which prompted the NHC to remonitor the system. The combination of strong wind shear and its rapid forward speed inhibited significant development, and the remnant dissipated around 1200UTC on August11, about 980mi (1,565km) west of the Azores.|$|E
