5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period of {{recession}} as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state. It {{was not until the}} middle of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export. The first factories were established at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} at West Point, Devers was {{selected}} to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924, and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd {{in the class of}} 258, which was topped by Dwight Eisenhower. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. Among the officers he worked with was Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number of innovative artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques that would later be successfully used during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the inter-war period. The idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E

5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|No. 3 Squadron began re-arming with Hawker Hurricane fighters on 29January 1941, and Rawlinson {{started his}} {{conversion}} on 3February. A week later, the squadron moved to RAF Station Benina {{to take over}} the air defence of Benghazi, which had been occupied by the 6thDivision. German aircraft began appearing at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Afrika Korps and a Luftwaffe contingent under General Erwin Rommel arrived in North Africa to reinforce the Italians; the Germans launched their offensive in March, and Benina was evacuated on 3April. The same day, Rawlinson was credited with shooting down three German Junkers Ju87 dive bombers, and damaging another, during a single sortie in his Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On January1, 1949, NY18 was realigned {{to follow}} a more inland routing between the village of Lewiston and what is now Four Mile Creek State Park. The former {{riverside}} and lakeside routing of NY18 between the two locations was redesignated as NY18F. At the time, NY18F was one of five spur routes of NY18, {{which at the time}} extended southward to the Pennsylvania state line. NY18A, NY18B, and NY18D were assigned to spurs of NY18 south of Lewiston, while NY18E was assigned to a spur of NY18 in the village of Lewiston that connected the village to the second Queenston–Lewiston Bridge. When NY18 was truncated to Lewiston on January 1, 1962,, NY18A, NY18B, and NY18D were either renumbered or absorbed by pre-existing routes. NY18E also ceased to exist around <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Queenston–Lewiston Bridge was removed and replaced with the modern Lewiston–Queenston Bridge just upstream.|$|E

5|$|Ragnall was {{a son of}} Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll (died 1164) and his wife, Ragnhildr, {{daughter}} of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. Somairle and Ragnhildr had at least three sons: Dubgall (died after 1175), Ragnall, Áengus (died 1210), and probably also a fourth, Amlaíb. Dubgall {{appears to have been}} the couple's eldest son. Little is certain of the origins of Ragnall's father, although his marriage suggests that he belonged to a family of some substance. In {{the first half of the}} twelfth century, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man (Mann) were encompassed within the Kingdom of the Isles, which was ruled by Somairle's father-in-law, a member of the Crovan dynasty. Somairle's rise to power may well have begun at about <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> few surviving sources from the era suggest that Argyll may have begun to slip from the control of David I, King of Scots (died 1153).|$|E
5|$|The men {{arrived in}} Singapore on 18 February 1941 {{and moved into}} barracks at Port Dickson, {{in the north of}} Malaya. While there, the {{battalion}} undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare, before moving to Seremban in March. Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> battalion was brought up to its wartime establishment. The rigours of jungle training and the tropical heat affected the men, and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria, measles, mumps and serious tropical skin diseases. Some of these were repatriated back to Australia, {{and by the end of}} March, the 2/18th was still below its authorised establishment, with an actual strength of 898.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{force in}} Polish politics, the {{long-established}} Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), suffered a fatal split at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ruling Stalinists applied the salami tactics to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians {{cooperated with the}} left-wing PPS faction led by Józef Cyrankiewicz, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss {{the idea of a}} party merger. The Kremlin, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a de facto one-party state and a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: United People's Party, a small farmers' party, and the Democratic Party, a token intelligentsia party (see also: political organization in Poland 1945–1989).|$|E

5|$|In 1147 William fitzHerbert, the Archbishop of York, was deposed, {{and a new}} {{election}} for the archbishopric was ordered by Pope Eugenius III on 11 May 1147. The election took place on 24 July 1147 at Richmond rather than York, due to the opposition of William of Aumale, the Earl of York, who supported the ousted archbishop. Robert, along with Hugh de Puiset {{and some of the}} cathedral chapter, favoured Hilary, a canon lawyer. Most {{of the rest of the}} archdiocese's officials and the chapter favoured Henry Murdac. The disputed election was decided by the pope, who declared Murdac the new archbishop and gave the vacant bishopric of Chichester to Hilary. Murdac was consecrated by Eugenius on 7 December 1147, and Robert appears to have supported the new archbishop, or at least not to have actively opposed him. But others among the cathedral chapter and suffragan bishops of York continued to actively agitate against Murdac, including refusing him entry to York for three years. Robert took little other part in the disputes at York during Murdac's archiepiscopate. Probably, it was Robert's involvement in secular office as chancellor that restricted his activities with his ecclesiastical office. Robert may have become a supporter of Murdac's during <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> archbishop addressed at least six confirmation grants to Robert.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 18hours {{after being}} {{classified}} a depression, deep convection {{wrapped around the}} center of the system, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to a tropical storm, and to give it the name Celia. Satellite overpasses of the storm revealed that Celia had already begun developing an eye-like feature at the surface, an indication that rapid intensification may ensue. The storm tracked relatively slowly towards the west-southwest in response to a mid-level ridge to the north. By the evening of June19, Celia displayed a well-organized structure with an eye beginning to appear within the storm's central dense overcast. Due to the presence of easterly wind shear, intensification was briefly stalled for several hours; however, at 1800UTC on June20, the NHC upgraded Celia to a minimal hurricane as it attained winds of 75mph (120km/h). An intermittent eye was seen on visible satellite image throughout the day, but it failed to fully consolidate by the afternoon of June21, by which time the system appeared to be vertically tilted, having the low-level circulation displaced to the northeast of the mid-level circulation. Only modest strengthening took place during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> system's outflow was being restricted by continuing easterly shear.|$|E
