5|$|The extant folios of the {{manuscript}} start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it</b> properly. The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise {{the doctrine of the}} four Gospels' unity of message.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it</b> from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

25|$|Hitler {{visited the}} model {{frequently}} {{during his time}} living in the bunker under the Reich Chancellery, spending many hours sitting silently in front of it.

25|$|Although the Chinese Room {{argument}} was originally presented {{in reaction to}} the statements of AI researchers, philosophers have come <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it</b> as {{an important part of the}} philosophy of mind.

5000|$|The Flemish {{saw these}} {{facilities}} {{as a measure}} of integration to another language, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>it</b> as a recognition of a permanent linguistic minority. The French-speaking people, however, saw these language facilities as an acquired right, and a step for an eventual addition to the bilingual region of Brussels, even though that would be unconstitutional. As a result, the amount of French-speaking people in these regions (mostly around Brussels) did not decline, and contain a growing majority of French-speaking Belgians, even though they reside in the officially monolingual Flanders. This [...] "frenchification" [...] is considered frustrating by the Flemish Movement and a reason for a call to separate.|$|R

5000|$|There {{was much}} in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for {{his concept of}} the false self. Helene Deutsch had {{described}} the [...] "as if" [...] personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones. Winnicott's analyst, Joan Riviere, had explored {{the concept of the}} narcissist's masquerade - superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control. Freud's own late theory of the ego as the product of identifications came close <b>to</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>it</b> only as a false self; while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to Michael Balint's [...] "basic fault" [...] and to Ronald Fairbairn's notion of the [...] "compromised ego".|$|R

25|$|Unlike other left groups, the SPGB {{did not see}} fascism as {{a special}} threat to the working class. Rather than formulating it as the last refuge of {{capitalism}} organising to defend itself against the working class, the party’s writers and speakers tended <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it</b> as {{a particular type of}} reform movement. The two specific characteristics identified, though, were that it tended to be a form of national consolidation – unifying fragment nations such as Germany, Italy and Spain – and that it tended to have the mass support of the working class.|$|E

Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to the Falkland Islands—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas' rations of soma following Linda's death.

This viewpoint will make it easier to talk about subalgebras of the power set algebra 2N, which this viewpoint makes the Boolean algebra of all sequences of bits. It also fits well with the columns of a truth table: when a column is read from top to bottom it constitutes a sequence of bits, {{but at the same time}} it can be viewed as the set of those valuations (assignments to variables in the left half of the table) at which the function represented by that column evaluates to 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{design for}} the {{renovation}} project by Grimshaw architects with, during design development stage, newly established Youmeheshe architects and Buro Happold engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a Kevlar web, allowing visitors to pass under the hull <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it.</b> Unfortunately {{it was discovered that}} the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship's hull which would effectively mask the hull's shape from view. An alternate {{design for the}} support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal tubular steel struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.|$|E
25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and <b>to</b> <b>view</b> <b>it</b> as a sign of weakness. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).|$|E
