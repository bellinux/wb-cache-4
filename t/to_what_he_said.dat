He collected and published material in The Fredonian related <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was Burr's conspiracy to overthrow the US government.

5|$|The {{next seven}} games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. Fischer {{was unable to}} get the initiative. Spassky was {{choosing}} lines that Fischer was unable to break. With a three-point lead, Fischer was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate. The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly– they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants– removed the television cameras), a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.|$|E
25|$|Huhne was {{involved}} in developing his party's thoughts on climate change and the environment, including {{a consideration of the}} challenges and opportunities they create for British businesses. He also drew attention <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was the divergence between the Conservative Party's environmental rhetoric and its policies.|$|E

25|$|In February 2016, Kobach {{endorsed}} Donald Trump's {{campaign for}} the U.S. Presidency, citing his stance on immigration. He proposed a halt <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was $23 billion in annual remittances by Mexican nationals illegally living in the U.S. unless Mexico makes a one-time $5–10 billion payment for Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.|$|E
25|$|Series result: a 1–0 win to Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene raised points similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{after the}} Colombo test, saying England’s {{approach}} was too negative. Whilst his criticism was perhaps unjustified {{in the second}} test, it certainly wasn’t here. England did appear to have given up during day 2, and this possibly acted {{as a catalyst for}} the poor batting performance that followed.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note her notebook. However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E

60|$|It became {{painful to}} Rachel {{to be one}} of those who write Keats and Shelley. She liked Richard Dalloway, and warmed as he warmed. <b>He</b> seemed <b>to</b> mean <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
500|$|As {{the mid-1990s}} {{included}} adaptations of four Austen novels, {{there were few}} of her works to adapt. Andrew Higson argues that {{this resulted in a}} [...] "variety of successors" [...] in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples include Mrs Dalloway (1997), Mrs. Brown (1997), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). In 2008, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter of Pride and Prejudice, adapted Sense and Sensibility for television. As a reaction <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was Lee's overly [...] "sentimental" [...] film, this production features events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson's screenplay, such as Willoughby's seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also features actors closer to the ages in the source material.|$|E

60|$|His words {{seemed to}} rouse Walker, for {{he opened his}} eyes once more, and now they were all misty. He wanted to speak, but he was so weak that Mackintosh had to strain his ears <b>to</b> catch <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
