25|$|If P and Q are {{two points}} on the curve, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> uniquely {{describe}} a third point, P + Q, in the following way. First, draw the line that intersects P and Q. This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, R. We then take P + Q to be −R, the point opposite R.|$|E
25|$|A {{shrinking}} argument also eliminates 5-fold symmetry. Consider {{a regular}} pentagon of lattice points. If it exists, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take every other edge displacement and (head-to-tail) assemble a 5-point star, {{with the last}} edge returning to the starting point. The vertices of such a star are again vertices of a regular pentagon with 5-fold symmetry, but about 60% smaller than the original.|$|E
25|$|Proof. If two {{rotations}} share a fixed point, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> swivel {{the mirror}} pair {{of the second}} rotation to cancel the inner mirrors of the sequence of four (two and two), leaving just the outer pair. Thus the composition of two rotations with a common fixed point produces a rotation by {{the sum of the}} angles about the same fixed point.|$|E

25|$|If x and y are integers, rationals, or real numbers, then xy=0 implies x=0 or y=0. Suppose abc=0.

Therefore, if abc=0, then a=0 or (b=0 or c=0), so abc=0 implies a=0 or b=0 or c=0.|$|E
25|$|Imagine {{that some}} {{observer}} rotates with {{constant angular velocity}} about some axis. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take the two fixed points to be the North and South poles of the celestial sphere.

25|$|Integral linear {{programs}} are of central {{importance in the}} polyhedral aspect of combinatorial optimization since they provide an alternate characterization of a problem. Specifically, for any problem, the convex hull of the solutions is an integral polyhedron; if this polyhedron has a nice/compact description, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> efficiently find the optimal feasible solution under any linear objective. Conversely, if we can prove that a linear programming relaxation is integral, then it is the desired description of the convex hull of feasible (integral) solutions.|$|E

25|$|If {{we allow}} for the {{possibility}} that K1a9 and N1b2 might have a Near Eastern source, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> estimate the overall fraction of European maternal ancestry at ~65%. Given the strength of the case for even these founders having a European source, however, our best estimate is to assign ~81% of Ashkenazi lineages to a European source, ~8% to the Near East and ~1% further to the east in Asia, with ~10% remaining ambiguous... Thus at least two-thirds and most likely more than four-fifths of Ashkenazi maternal lineages have a European ancestry.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} Cumbric {{could well have}} survived {{into the middle of}} the 12th century as a {{community}} language and even lasted into the 13th on the tongues of the last remaining speakers. Certain areas seem to be particularly dense in Cumbric place-names even down to very minor features. The two most striking of these are around Lanercost east of Carlisle and around Torquhan south of Edinburgh. If the 1262 names from Peebles do contain traces of Cumbric personal names <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> imagine Cumbric dying out between 1250 and 1300 at the very latest.|$|E
25|$|The arms of spiral galaxies rotate {{around the}} galactic centre. The {{luminous}} mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the centre to the outskirts. If luminous mass {{were all the}} matter, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it (similar to the solar system). From Kepler's Second Law, we expect that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the centre, similar to our solar system. This is not observed. Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distant from the centre as the data is available.|$|E

25|$|If we {{just look}} at the {{short-term}} spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that the Lambroughton {{mentioned}} in the early records refer to the site the farm now known as Townhead of Lambroughton. Pont records a Mains of Lambrochtoun in 1604 and as the term 'mains' refers to the home farm of an estate, cultivated by or for the 'owner', <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> assume that the main dwelling was here or hereabouts. The 'place ' of Lambroughtoun is mentioned in 1544. It should be noted that it was the custom of a landowner or farmer to take the name of the land which he owned or cultivated.|$|E
25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E
