500|$|In a 1993 promotional {{interview}} for the album, Steinman reasserts {{the continuation of}} the Bat world. [...] "I didn't call it Bat Out of Hell II just to identify with the first record. It really does feel like an extension of that... It was a chance <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> world and explore it deeper. It always seemed incomplete because I conceived it like a film, and what would you do without Die Hard 2?" [...] Meat Loaf himself was more succinct. He told an interview at the time, [...] "We called it Bat Out of Hell II 'cos that would help it sell shitloads." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Scott Hutchison {{revealed}} {{plans to}} record a solo album, stating: [...] "With Pedestrian Verse being more collaborative, I said I’d never write a Frightened Rabbit record in the way I used to, which is true. But it doesn’t mean I don’t want to write any records like that. It’s {{going to be really}} pleasant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> way of working, where I sit around and do stuff myself." [...] Both keyboardist and guitarist Andy Monaghan and touring member Simon Liddell collaborated with Scott on the project, which was later named Owl John.|$|E

2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There {{were times when}} I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2010s, {{there was}} a {{discussion}} within media of a possible nu metal revival because of bands fusing nu metal with other genres, the return of nu metal bands, extant bands {{going back to the}} nu metal genre and nu metal bands forming. Despite the lack of radio play and popularity, some nu metal bands recaptured some of their former popularity as they released albums in a nu metal style. Korn's 2010 studio album [...] sold 63,000 copies during its first week of release and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200. As of December 6, 2011, the album had sold at least 185,000 units in the United States. Korn's vocalist Jonathan Davis said with their new album the band [...] "want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> old-school vibe". He also said [...] "It's gonna be very raw, it's gonna be old school like the first Korn records".|$|E
