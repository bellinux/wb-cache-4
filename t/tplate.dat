40|$|<b>TPLATE</b> was {{previously}} {{identified as a}} potential cytokinesis protein targeted to the cell plate. Disruption of <b>TPLATE</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana leads {{to the production of}} shriveled pollen unable to germinate. Vesicular compartmentalization of the mature pollen is dramatically altered, and large callose deposits accumulate near the intine cell wall layer. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged <b>TPLATE</b> expression {{under the control of the}} pollen promoter Lat 52 complements the phenotype. Downregulation of <b>TPLATE</b> in Arabidopsis seedlings and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY- 2 suspension cells results in crooked cell walls and cell plates that fail to insert into the mother wall. Besides accumulating at the cell plate, GFP-fused <b>TPLATE</b> is temporally targeted to a narrow zone at the cell cortex where the cell plate connects to the mother wall. TPLATE-GFP also localizes to subcellular structures that accumulate at the pollen tube exit site in germinating pollen. Ectopic callose depositions observed in mutant pollen also occur in RNA interference plants, suggesting that <b>TPLATE</b> is implicated in cell wall modification. <b>TPLATE</b> contains domains similar to adaptin and b-COP coat proteins. These data suggest that <b>TPLATE</b> functions in vesicle-trafficking events required for site-specific cell wall modifications during pollen germination and for anchoring of the cell plate to the mother wall at the correct cortical position...|$|E
40|$|Clathrin-mediated {{endocytosis}} is {{the major}} mechanism for eukaryotic plasma membrane-based proteome turn-over. In plants, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is essential for physiology and development, but the identification and organization of the machinery operating this process remains largely obscure. Here, we identified an eight-core-component protein complex, the <b>TPLATE</b> complex, essential for plant growth via its role as major adaptor module for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This complex consists of evolutionarily unique proteins that associate closely with core endocytic elements. The <b>TPLATE</b> complex is recruited as dynamic foci at the plasma membrane preceding recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2, clathrin, and dynamin-related proteins. Reduced function of different complex components severely impaired internalization of assorted endocytic cargoes, demonstrating its pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Taken together, the <b>TPLATE</b> complex is an early endocytic module representing a unique evolutionary plant adaptation of the canonical eukaryotic pathway for clathrin-mediated endocytosis...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{cytokinesis}} deploys a {{transport system}} that centers cell plate-forming vesicles and fuses them {{to form a}} cell plate. Here we show that the adaptin-like protein <b>TPLATE</b> and clathrin light chain 2 (CLC 2) are targeted to the expanding cell plate and to the equatorial subregion of the plasma membrane {{referred to as the}} cortical division zone (CDZ). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and immunodetection indicates that <b>TPLATE</b> interacts with clathrin. Pharmacological tools as well as analysis of protein targeting in a mutant background affecting cell plate formation allowed to discriminate two recruitment pathways for <b>TPLATE</b> and CLC 2. The cell plate recruitment pathway is dependent on phragmoplast microtubule organization and the formation and transport of secretory vesicles. The CDZ recruitment pathway, on the other hand, is activated at the end of cytokinesis and independent of trans-Golgi-derived vesicle trafficking. <b>TPLATE</b> and CLC 2 do not accumulate at a narrow zone central of the CDZ. We have dubbed this subdomain the cortical division site and show that it corresponds precisely with the position where the cell plate merges with the parental wall. These data provide evidence that the plasma membrane is subject to localized endocytosis or membrane remodeling processes that are required for the fusion of the cell plate with a predefined region of the plasma membrane...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the classical adaptins, {{a large number of}} accessory proteins have a similar function in linking cargo and lipids to the AP 2 -clathrin assembly, including epsin, AP 180, eps 15, and <b>TPLATE.</b> These accessory proteins were also able to influence actin dynamics and induce membrane curvature for invagination of the plasma membrane into vesicles (Fan et al. 2015). In our study, three epsin (1 / 2 / 3) genes, one AP 180 gene, and one adaptin-like gene were observed in our data. Furthermore, three accessory proteins, epsin 1, AP 180 and adaptin-like protein (c 36930 _g 2, c 50842 _g 1 and c 28875 _g 1) showed increased accumulation in protocorms according to transcriptomic data.|$|E
40|$|Clathrin-mediated {{endocytosis}} (CME) is {{the predominant}} and evolutionarily conserved pathway by which eukaryotes internalize cargoes (i. e., plasma membrane proteins, lipids, and extracellular material) that {{are engaged in}} a variety of processes. Initiation of CME relies on adaptor proteins, which precisely select the cargoes for internalization, recruit the clathrin cage, and start membrane curvature. The recently identified CME early adaptor complex, the <b>TPLATE</b> complex (TPC), is essential for CME in plants. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the TPC evolved from an ancient protein complex involved in vesicle trafficking in early eukaryotes, which raises questions about CME evolution and adaptation within the eukaryotic Kingdoms. In this review, we focus on the early events of plant CME and explore evolutionary aspects related to CME in other eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|At {{the onset}} of mitosis, plant cells reorganize their {{cortical}} microtubule array into a narrow ring encircling the nucleus until late prophase. This transient cytoskeletal structure is termed the preprophase band (PPB) and is believed to establish the plasma membrane (PM) identity at the cortical division zone (CDZ) which persists until cytokinesis. The CDZ {{is determined by the}} presence or particular exclusion of several marker proteins with a cell plate guiding function. The expanding phragmoplast mediates the directional growth of the cell plate towards the CDZ, where the cell plate anchors to the parental plasma membrane at the end of cytokinesis. Therefore, the PPB defines the division plane early in mitosis and spatially controls plant cell division. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the identity of the CDZ is established and maintained as well as the role of the division zone markers in supporting cell plate guidance remains unknown. Although a variety of proteins have thus far been described to be involved in division plane positioning, information about their biochemical properties and interconnections is largely missing. The aim of this doctoral research was to increase our current understanding of division zone demarcation in plant cells and attempt to link the known players. Because the biological function of a protein is predominantly determined by protein interaction networks, a targeted interactomics approach based on the tandem affinity purification (TAP) -technology was set up starting from a set of bait proteins recognized {{to play a role in}} division zone demarcation. The TAP technology allows a high-throughput isolation of in vivo protein complexes under native conditions and requires no prior knowledge on the protein complexes in which the bait participates. Through the co-purification of interaction partners, a division zone interactome can be built which might ultimately enable us to correlate the known players, but will definitely identify novel candidate proteins involved in the process of division plane positioning. Based on subsequent fluorescence microscopy screening, those interactors which specifically localize to division plane figures such as the preprophase band, the PM at the cortical division zone or the expanding cell plate will be selected for further functional characterization using a combination of genetic and live-cell imaging analysis. This doctoral thesis can be subdivided in two major parts, each considering a specific functional branch present in the division zone interactome. Part one (chapters 1 - 3) provides a general overview of the obtained division zone interactome and describes novel players and protein complexes involved in division plane positioning and division zone demarcation. This targeted interactomics approach resulted amongst others in the isolation of a TON 1 /TRM/FASS PP 2 A phosphatase (TTP) complex, which was fully characterized in a collaborative effort with the research group of Prof. Dr. David Bouchez and Dr. Martine Pastuglia (INRA, Versailles). Our data tightly connected TON 1, which shows homology to human centrosomal proteins, and the PP 2 A B’’ regulatory subunit FASS to a heterotrimeric PP 2 A holo-enzyme, which is targeted to the cortical cytoskeleton by the TRM protein family Scope 4 to exert its function. Moreover, we illustrated the necessity of FASS/PP 2 A phosphatase activity for PPB formation. Part two of this doctoral thesis (chapters 4 - 6) focusses on endocytosis at the plasma membrane and how endocytosis participates in cell plate anchoring at the CDZ. In light of this question, the cell biological function of the plant-specific multi-subunit complex comprising <b>TPLATE,</b> isolated through the targeted division zone interactomics approach described in part one, was functionally investigated. Besides the occurrence of two distinct recruitment pathways for the <b>TPLATE</b> complex and CLC 2 during somatic cytokinesis, a cell plate recruitment pathway and a CDZ recruitment pathway during cell plate anchoring, we show that the <b>TPLATE</b> complex performs a more general function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the PM throughout plant development. The <b>TPLATE</b> complex could therefore provide a functional link between plasma membrane endocytosis and the maintenance of CDZ identity...|$|E

The treatment is controversial and various operative modalities {{have been reported in}} the literature. The aim of the present study was to evaluate functional outcome and complication rate after open reduction and internal fixation of displaced proximal humerus fractures by proximal humerus AO stainless steel <b>Tplate.</b> Twenty-five (25) patients with displaced proximal humerus fractures treated with proximal humerus T-plate between May 2005 and June 2008 were included in the study.

40|$|Background: Molecular phylogenetic {{investigations}} have revolutionized {{our understanding of}} the evolutionary history of ferns—the second-most species-rich major group of vascular plants, and the sister clade to seed plants. The general absence of genomic resources available for this important group of plants, however, has resulted in the strong dependence of these studies on plastid data; nuclear or mitochondrial data have been rarely used. In this study, we utilize transcriptome data to design primers for nuclear markers for use in studies of fern evolutionary biology, and demonstrate the utility of these markers across the largest order of ferns, the Polypodiales. Principal Findings: We present 20 novel single-copy nuclear regions, across 10 distinct protein-coding genes: ApPEFP_C, cryptochrome 2, cryptochrome 4, DET 1, gapCpSh, IBR 3, pgiC, SQD 1, <b>TPLATE,</b> and transducin. These loci, individually and in combination, show strong resolving power across the Polypodiales phylogeny, and are readily amplified and sequenced from our genomic DNA test set (from 15 diploid Polypodiales species). For each region, we also present transcriptome alignments of the focal locus and related paralogs—curated broadly across ferns—that will allow researchers to develop their own primer sets for fern taxa outside of the Polypodiales. Analyses of sequence data generated from our genomic DNA test set reveal strong effects of partitioning schemes on suppor...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000357434400006 International audienceThe cell's endomembranes {{comprise}} an intricate, highly {{dynamic and}} well-organized system. In plants, the proteins that regulate {{function of the}} various endomembrane compartments and their cargo remain largely unknown. Our aim was to dissect subcellular trafficking routes by enriching for partially overlapping subpopulations of endosomal proteomes associated with endomembrane markers. We selected RABD 2 a/ARA 5, RABF 2 b/ARA 7, RABF 1 /ARA 6, and RABG 3 f as markers for combinations of the Golgi, trans-Golgi network (TGN), early endosomes (EE), secretory vesicles, late endosomes (LE), multivesicular bodies (MVB), and the tonoplast. As comparisons we used Golgi transport 1 (GOT 1), which localizes to the Golgi, clathrin light chain 2 (CLC 2) labeling clathrincoated vesicles and pits and the vesicle-associated membrane protein 711 (VAMP 711) present at the tonoplast. We developed an easy-to-use method by refining published protocols based on affinity purification of fluorescent fusion constructs to these seven subcellular marker proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We present a total of 433 proteins, only five of which were shared among all enrichments, while many proteins were common between endomembrane compartments of the same trafficking route. Approximately half, 251 proteins, were assigned to one enrichment only. Our dataset contains known regulators of endosome functions including small GTPases, SNAREs, and tethering complexes. We identify known cargo proteins such as PIN 3, PEN 3, CESA, and the recently defined <b>TPLATE</b> complex. The subcellular localization of two GTPase regulators predicted from our enrichments was validated using live-cell imaging. This is the first proteomic dataset to discriminate between such highly overlapping endomembrane compartments in plants {{and can be used}} as a general proteomic resource to predict the localization of proteins and identify the components of regulatory complexes and provides a useful tool for the identification of new protein markers of the endomembrane system...|$|E
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} {{joining technique}} {{which can be}} used for joining not only traditionally weldable aluminium alloys but also high strength aluminium and other metallic alloys that are hard to weld using conventional fusion welding processes. During FSW a rotating tool consisting of a shoulder and a pin is first plunged into the joint line of two plates to be welded. Intensive heat is generated as the tool rotates and travels against the plates, causing the latter to be softened without gross melting. The softened material is then stirred and deposited at the back of pin as the tool traverses the joint line, hence making a joint. The process of conducting FSW in lap joint configuration is called friction stir lap welding (FSLW). Mechanical strength of FSL welds under static loading is commonly determined using tensile shear testing and fracture strength (σLap) corresponding to the maximum load in a test over the sample width is widely used the strength value. During FSLW of similar metallic alloys, a part of the original lapping interface between the plates is lifted up due to a specific material flow induced by the rotating threaded tool pin, taking a hook shape. Such a hook in a FSL welds often provides a favourable site for crack propagation under loading and thus adversely affects σLap. Furthermore, FS heat causes local softening but grain refinement by dynamic recrystallisation contributes to hardening in stir zone. Thus strength is location dependent. In FSLW of dissimilar metallic alloys with large differences in melting temperatures, a metallurgical bond is established through the formation of interfacial intermetallics. However, as these intermetallic compounds are generally believed to be brittle with limited ductility, they are commonly viewed to adversely affect σLap. the aim of the present research is to provide thermomechanical explanation on how ω and ν affects hook formation during FSLW; to understand how hooking, FS softening, stress concentration and local deformation mechanisms (under loading) relate to σLap of Al and Mg FSL welds; and to reveal how the interface structure is affected by FS conditions and how the formation of interface structure affects σLap of Al/Steel and Al/Ti FSL welds. For FSL welds of Al 6060 -T 5, it was found that low penetration required low v for a sufficient bonding. For sufficient penetration, (, v) -AB-SZ-h relationships were presented. Measured data have suggested that the increase of AB-SZ as  increases is the result of increase in TSZ and thus the stir zone plasticity. A rapid increase in h to a maximum value (hMax) when AB-SZ increased from a minimum value was identified. Evidence of shoulder flow limiting the hMax will be shown and explained. When h tended to zero, despite of the existence of an un-welded lap and thus a high stress concentration, σLap (422 N/mm) was very close to BoP (fracture strength of butt joint geometry). This is due to local bending offered by the high ductility of the Al FCC structure thus reorientating to reduce considerably the stress concentration. It was found that when h ~ 30 % <b>tPlate,</b> it started to invoke a significant effect on reducing σLap, due to the increasingly larger reduction in load bearing area. It will be demonstrated that FS flow and the subsequent tensile-shear mechanical behaviours of magnesium alloy AZ 31 B-H 24 are significantly different from those of Al 6060 -T 5 alloy. For AZ 31 B-H 24 alloy, FS zone was comparatively smaller and there was little discontinuity in each hook. It will be shown that due to lack of local sample rotation during tensile shear testing, as a result of low number of slip systems offered for plastic deformation by Mg alloy, high stress concentration of the lap joint geometry was maintained (during testing) causing failure with a significantly lower σLap value (290 N/mm), when h tended to zero. Also for the same reason, unlike Al 6060 -T 5 welds, FS softening could not compete with hooking for local deformation and fracture. Thus hooking location was always the location of fracture. Results of numerical modelling and artificial hook testing experiments showed that stress distribution at hook region (during tensile shear testing) was considerably affected by the orientation of hooking. This explains that fracturing proceeds away from the hook, for negative hooking samples. Significant stress concentration caused by tensile shear loading enhanced the localised operation of twinning at the hook region, facilitating a fracture in brittle manner. Finally, detailed evidence has suggested that the major factor determining σLap of Al/Steel and Al/Ti FSL welds is the degree of contact between the bottom of the pin and surface of bottom plate (steel or to Ti 6 Al 4 V) during welding. Insufficient contact resulted in discontinuous intermetallic layer in the form of outbursts. This type of interface will be shown to resist loading poorly and thus low σLap was obtained. When the pin was at a very short distance or just touching the bottom plate, a thin intermetallic layer formed at the interface. Further pin penetration into the bottom plate resulted in the formation of a mix interface region consisting of cut layers of the bottom plate material and irregular intermetallic layers. The mixed layer interface region corresponded to reasonable weld strength (σLap≈ 300 N/mm in Al/Steel FSLW and σLap≈ 340 N/mm in Al/Ti FSLW) consistent with data in literature. It will be demonstrated that a thin intermetallic layer formed under the condition of carefully positioning the pin very close or just touching the bottom plate (without severely penetrating) provided the most unfavourable crack propagation path. As a result, high strength joints with σLap= 435 N/mm in Al/Steel FSLW and σLap= 732 N/mm in Al/Ti FSLW was achieved...|$|E
