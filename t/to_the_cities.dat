The Tlicho Community Government Act (TCGA), enacted in 2004, also considers community governments as municipal corporations alongside charter communities, cities, hamlets, towns and villages.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} perceived city brand image on emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> study also compares the effects of perceived brand image of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> on <b>the</b> emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> across two groups: residents and visitors. Design/methodology - A total of 207 usable questionnaires were collected from 107 residents of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Bratislava, Slovakia, and 100 visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method was used for data analysis. Findings - This study establishes that perceived city brand image significantly influences emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> study concludes that affective city image has greater impact on emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> among <b>the</b> residents than visitors. In contrast, the influence of cognitive city image on emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> does not vary across the two categories of residents and visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Practical implications - City tourism marketers should focus on improving city brand images to enhance tourists’ emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> promote repeat visits among visitors. Originality/value - This study contributes to improving understanding {{of the impact of}} perceived city brand image on emotional attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> across <b>the</b> two groups, residents and visitors, using social exchange theory. Furthermore, the findings come from a relatively under-researched Central and Eastern European (CEE) region. <br /...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> unincorporated rural settlements {{known as}} colonias often lack basic infrastructure and {{are marked by}} poverty. The office of the Texas Attorney General stated, in 2011, that Texas had about 2,294 colonias and estimates that about 500,000 lived in the colonias. Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has {{the largest number of}} colonias. Texas has the largest number of people of all states, living in colonias.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{population}} live in poverty, occupied in farming or raising livestock. Some have moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> to seek {{a higher standard of}} living, returning to help during the peak periods of agricultural activity. Infrastructure is underdeveloped; there is no electricity supply, most water comes from traditional wells, and the rudimentary school system provides only elementary education in poorly equipped establishments.|$|E

5|$|Unemployment {{resulting}} from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial growth spurt of the 1930s gradually slowed. The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed {{to the process of}} internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> especially Buenos Aires, where there were greater opportunities for employment. The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections. Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities.</b> Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria {{to a member of}} the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Alain Prost {{was born}} {{near the town}} of Saint-Chamond, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> of Lyon and Saint-Etienne in the département of Loire, France, to André Prost and Marie-Rose Karatchian, born in France of Armenian descent. Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986. Although short, {{standing}} at 1.67m (5ft 6 in) Prost was an active, athletic child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times. He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday. This new sport quickly became his career of choice.|$|E
5|$|He {{then made}} way to Egypt, {{arriving}} to a tumultuous reception in January AD 19. He had gone there to relieve a famine {{in the country}} vital to Rome's food supply. The move upset Tiberius, because it had violated an order by Augustus that no senator shall enter the province without consulting the emperor and the Senate (Egypt was an imperial province, and belonged to the emperor). He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his orders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> and legions. Germanicus in turn ordered Piso's recall to Rome, although this action was probably beyond his authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{population}} of Wales was 587 thousand, {{and most of these}} would have been living in rural areas and employed in agriculture. By 1911, {{the population}} had swelled to 2.4 million, more than half of whom lived in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, where they were employed in mining, steel and other industries. There was a shift away from the land with many dwellers in the rural west emigrating in the 1830s and 1840s and migrating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. By 1911, agriculture was a minor industry in Glamorgan, and migrant labour from England was needed to help get in the harvest. Rural craftsmen were also lost and their supply was replenished from depressed areas of southwestern England and by mass immigration from Ireland.|$|E

On 22 October, both Concorde flight BA9021C, a special from Manchester, and BA002 from New York landed simultaneously on both of Heathrow's runways.

5|$|Jews also {{spread across}} Europe during the period. Communities were {{established}} in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Most Jews were confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> as they {{were not allowed to}} own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Refused legal {{representation}} or bail, Lenin denied all {{charges against him}} but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work {{he noted that the}} rise of industrial capitalism in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities,</b> where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow Tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.|$|E

It was extended southward to the US-Mexico border in 1955, and extended northward to Phoenix when it replaced U.S. Route 80 (US80) in 1977. The northern end of the highway was realigned in 1994 onto the connecting highway between I-10 and Buckeye. The remaining portion of the highway between Buckeye and Phoenix was gradually turned over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> and county along the route during the 1990s with the final portion turned over in 2001.|$|E
