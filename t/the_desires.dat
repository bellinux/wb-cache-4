5|$|The new {{commissioner}} {{spent the}} second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country. The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads, and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses, but {{to strike a balance between}} <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> of railroads and those of shippers.|$|E

50|$|A common {{method for}} {{producing}} {{one or more}} loops is as follows. The yarn is formed into <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> number of loops with <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> length. These loop(s) are held behind the work, drawn through <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> stitch using <b>the</b> right-hand needle and placed on the left-hand needle next to <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> stitch. <b>The</b> loops and <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> stitch are knit together to secure the loops.|$|R
5|$|Jain texts mention five transgressions (Atichara) of <b>the</b> vow: <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be reborn as a human, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be reborn as a divinity, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to {{continue}} living, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to die quickly, and <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> {{to live a}} sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>desire</b> for {{intimacy}} has biological roots and, in {{the great}} majority of people, persists from birth until death. <b>The</b> <b>desire</b> for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships that rarely satisfy <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|Kalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which fulfill <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> {{of people}} in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times {{children}} are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma. There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, fragrant flowers, shining lamps and a radiant light at night.|$|E
5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E

5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use of inappropriate weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, as he always did, defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E

25|$|The second, funding, {{notes that}} the outlets derive the {{majority}} of their funding from advertising, not readers.

25|$|The {{family is}} the agent to which {{capitalist}} production delegates the psychological repression of <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> of the child. Psychological repression is distinguished from social oppression insofar as it works unconsciously. Through it, Deleuze and Guattari argue, parents transmit their angst and irrational fears to their child and bind the child's sexual desires to feelings of shame and guilt.|$|E
50|$|Items I1 and E1 {{are called}} causal, I2 and E2 are called persuasive, and I3 and E3 are called supportive.

25|$|Art historians often examine work in {{the context}} of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with {{consideration}} of <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and symbolism. In short, this approach examines the work of art {{in the context of}} the world within which it was created.|$|E

25|$|The {{initiatives}} of the Gregorian reformers led {{to greater}} contact between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula, especially through <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> {{of the judges}} to establish monasteries with monks from continental monasteries at Montecassino and Marseille. By the 12th century, the Sardinian Giudicati, though obscure, are visible through the mists of time. They professed allegiance to the Holy See, which put them {{under the authority of}} the Archdiocese of Pisa, superseding the ancient primacy of the Archdiocese of Cagliari on the island.|$|E
25|$|He {{recognised}} no activity without motion, and so referred {{all activities}} of the soul to motion: <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> and emotions to corporeal motion, judgment (kriseis) and contemplation to spiritual motion. The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet {{he appears to have}} contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it. Other Peripatetics, like Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and especially Strato, developed further this naturalism in Aristotelian doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The book characterizes al-Qaeda {{not as an}} {{offshoot}} of Islam but as a destructive religious cult. He suggests American federal officials create a position to coordinate actions against al-Qaeda, put together academic gatherings to discuss the matter, and use public relations to counter extremist ideology. Nance praises Barack Obama's oratory skills, and characterizes the president as a formidable public relations tool to use in achieving these objectives. The author emphasizes traditional Muslim people want the same goals and aspirations for their families as <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> of U.S. citizens.|$|E

Combined with the cultural values of a pre-existing situation, the four wishes give rise to certain attitudes which are subjectively defined meanings and shared experience, strongly emphasised and embodied in specific institutions.|$|R
