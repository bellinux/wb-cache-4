2500|$|This is Tundra's {{first album}} with vocals, {{and all but}} one of the tracks have vocals. The lyrics on Mastered by Guy at The Exchange have been {{described}} as not being rich with subtext. Max Tundra refers to this on [...] "Labial" [...] with [...] "I only sing about things that happen to me/ I never learned to fill my songs with allegory" [...] The BBC noted recurring themes included [...] "unaffected tales of Food Chemistry, bands splitting up, employment history and even an homage to video maker Michel Gondry." [...] while Pitchfork Media noted theme of [...] "girls he's loved or loves, complaints about his day jobs". The lyrics are also littered with musical references. References range from trance music and the band Yes where he sings [...] "Downstair's they're playing trance again / that awful bendy guitar / up through the floor again / It's 9am till I cry / And Time and a Word my friend / Inspires me more than guitars". Pitchfork also described the song [...] "Gondry" [...] as a plea to filmmaker and music video director Michel Gondry to direct one for him with lyrics referencing his music videos for [...] "Let Forever Be" [...] and [...] "Around the World". Stylus Magazine described the album's first single for [...] "Lysine" [...] as sounding like a nutrition manual with lyrics of [...] "many foods are rich in arginine, concentrate on the ones with more lysine". Max Tundra has also stated that not everything he wrote about actually happened. In an interview with Stylus Magazine, he proclaimed that [...] "half the lyrics on that album are true and half are false, but Iâ€™m not gonna <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>which</b> half." ...|$|E

2500|$|Caragiale {{compared}} {{writers who}} could not dissimulate their intent and generate a good story with [...] "a cross-eyed who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>which</b> way to go: one doesn't known {{if he is to}} go down the road he points to, or down the road he is looking at". Speaking in the late 1890s, he also likened writing for the stage with architecture: ...|$|R
