5|$|The Tahiti rail, Tahitian red-billed rail, or Pacific red-billed rail (Gallirallus pacificus) is an {{extinct species}} of rail that lived on Tahiti. It was first {{recorded}} during James Cook's second voyage {{around the world}} (1772â€“1775), on which it was illustrated by Georg Forster and described by Johann Reinhold Forster. No specimens have been preserved. As well as the documentation by the Forsters, there have been claims that the bird also existed on the nearby island of Mehetia. The Tahiti rail {{appears to have been}} closely related to, and perhaps derived from, the buff-banded rail, and has also been historically confused with the Tongan subspecies of <b>that</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} of the West Indies {{is predominantly}} of tropical North American (southern North America and Central America) origin with aggressive South American species having colonized the area only recently. The South American families {{occurring in the}} Greater Antilles are the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), bananaquit (Coerebidae) and tanagers (Thraupidae), {{all of which are}} represented in Puerto Rico. The prevailing theory suggests <b>that</b> <b>bird</b> fauna colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. The most primitive West Indies birds are the todies which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican tody.|$|E

500|$|The Audubon society, {{reviewing}} {{the importance of}} birds in 2013, obtained statements from many people with differing perspectives.

5|$|The {{fossil record}} from the Pleistocene of Europe {{includes}} a form {{similar to the}} Alpine chough, and sometimes categorised as an extinct subspecies of <b>that</b> <b>bird,</b> and a prehistoric form of the red-billed chough, P. p. primigenius. There are eight generally recognised extant subspecies of red-billed chough, and two of Alpine, although all differ only slightly from the nominate forms. The greater subspecies diversity in the red-billed species arises from an early divergence of the Asian and geographically isolated Ethiopian races from the western forms.|$|E
5|$|Despite Blom-Cooper's {{recommendations}} <b>that</b> <b>Bird</b> {{never be}} allowed to hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself {{at odds with the}} Prime Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, in order to build a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes <b>that</b> <b>bird</b> and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E

5|$|The inquiry {{was run by}} Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; Bird was {{formally}} fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper arrived on Antigua. Blom-Cooper began work on 4 June, with Bird retaining a team of six lawyers for his defence; the inquiry, concluded in November, recommended banning Bird from holding public office {{for the rest of}} his life. The report was acted on and Bird was banned from becoming a minister again, although he retained his seat in the House. The report did not, however, recommend <b>that</b> <b>Bird</b> be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally; it was felt that the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough. Bird was later re-hired by the government, not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities. After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda's leader on 5 September 1995, Bird was made Chairman of the ALP.|$|E

25|$|Scientists hypothesize <b>that</b> <b>bird</b> song {{has evolved}} through sexual selection, and {{experiments}} {{suggest that the}} quality of bird song may be a good indicator of fitness. Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such as song rate, which thereby act as reliable indicators of health. The song repertoire also appears to indicate fitness in some species. The ability of male birds to hold and advertise territories using song also demonstrates their fitness.|$|E
25|$|This species shares much of {{its range}} with the common treecreeper. Compared to the short-toed, <b>that</b> <b>bird</b> is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter {{supercilium}} and slightly shorter bill. However, identification by sight may be impossible for poorly-marked birds. Vocal birds are usually identifiable, since Common has a distinctive song composed of twitters, ripples and a final whistle and a shree call rarely given by the short-toed; however, both species {{have been known to}} sing the other's song. Even in the hand, although the short-toed usually has a longer bill and shorter toes, 5% of birds are not safely identifiable.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{incidents}} of birds dying from botulism, in 2000, and in 2002. Birds affected included grebes, common and red-breasted mergansers, loons, diving ducks, ring-billed gulls and herring gulls. One account suggests <b>that</b> <b>bird</b> populations are in trouble, notably the woodland warbler, which had population declines around 60 percent in 2008. Possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices, loss of habitats, soil depletion and erosion, and toxic chemicals. In 2006, there were concerns of possible bird flu after two wild swans {{on the lake}} were found diseased, but it was learned {{that they did not}} contain the deadly H5N1 virus. There were sightings of a magnificent frigatebird, a tropical bird with a two-metre wingspan, over the lake in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In birds, whose cells contain microchromosomes, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that there was a correlation between the presence of mega-telomeres and the number of microchromosomes present in a species, such <b>that</b> <b>bird</b> genomes with large numbers of microchromosomes also possessed larger amounts of telomeric DNA sequence. It was thought that these telomeric sequences might protect genes on these tiny chromosomes from erosion during cell division. However, subsequent studies showed that mega-telomeres are not necessarily present in all species with microchromosomes, nor are they found on all microchromosomes within a cell. Mega-telomeres are also thought contribute to the high recombination rate of chicken microchromosomes. The longest mega-telomere in chickens is associated with the W (female) chromosome, suggesting that mega-telomeres may also affect sex chromosome organization and the generation of genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1900s, some early {{research}} in animal cooperation {{focused on the}} benefits of group-living. While living in a group produces costs in the form of increased frequency of predator attacks and greater mating competition, some animals find that the benefits outweigh the costs. Animals that practice group-living often benefit from assistance in parasite removal, access to more mates, and conservation of energy in foraging. Initially, the most obvious form of animal cooperation was kin selection, but more recent studies focus on non-kin cooperation, where benefits may seem less obvious. Non-kin cooperation often involves many strategies that include manipulation and coercion, making these interactions more complicated to study. An example of manipulation is presented by the cuckoo, a brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nest of a bird of another species. <b>That</b> <b>bird</b> then is tricked into feeding and caring for the cuckoo offspring. Although this phenomenon may look like cooperation at first glance, it only presents benefits to one recipient.|$|E
