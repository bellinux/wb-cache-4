5|$|It was {{customary}} {{when proposing}} a disputation {{to have the}} theses printed by the university press and publicly posted. No copies of a Wittenberg printing of the Ninety-five Theses have survived, {{but this is not}} surprising as Luther was not famous and the importance of the document was not recognized. In Wittenberg, the university statutes demand that theses be posted on every church door in the city, but Philip Melanchthon, who first mentioned the posting of the Theses, only mentioned the door of All Saints' Church. Melanchthon also claimed that Luther posted the Theses on 31 October, but this conflicts with several of Luther's statements about the course of events, and Luther always claimed that he brought his objections through proper channels rather than inciting a public controversy. It is possible that while Luther later saw the 31 October letter to Albert as the beginning of the Reformation, he did not post the Theses to the church door until mid-November, but he may not have posted them on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> all. Regardless, the Theses were well-known among the Wittenberg intellectual elite soon after Luther sent them to Albert.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{when the}} Changi Airport Line was opened, {{some of these}} trains plying the East West Line had luggage racks {{installed}}. These luggage racks were installed in every carriage of the train, taking up the space of two seats next to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of each}} carriage. The purpose of those racks were to let travellers heading to the airport, who usually carry a large amount of luggage, to have a space to place their bags easily.|$|E

25|$|The first {{train in}} the United Kingdom with {{corridor}} connections between all carriages entered service on 7 March 1890 on the Paddington to Birkenhead route, and further corridor trains were introduced on all the main routes {{over the next few}} years. In 1900 a new Milford Boat Train set introduced electric lights and the communication cord was moved inside the train; until now a passenger needing to stop the train in an emergency had to lean out of the window and pull a cord above <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>At</b> this time carriages generally had a clerestory roof but elliptical roofs were fitted to the GWR steam rail motors in 1903.|$|E

25|$|Whereas most {{dwellings}} in Madagascar {{are traditionally}} constructed from pliable plant materials, the Antandroy {{are one of}} the few ethnic groups to use wood plank to build their homes. Antandroy homes are traditionally square (not rectangular, as elsewhere on the island), raised on low stilts, topped with a peaked roof and constructed of vertically-hung planks of wood affixed to a wooden frame. These houses traditionally have no windows and feature three wooden doors: the front door is the women's entrance, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> the rear of the house is for children, and the third door is used by the men. Fences are often constructed around Antandroy houses using prickly-pear cactus (raketa) or lengths of indigenous succulents from the surrounding spiny forests.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, it was {{reported}} that Koné was to be shown <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> Sevilla in the summer of 2008 after a disappointing first season. His lack of playing time, partly due to the form of strikers Luís Fabiano and Kanouté, and an argument on the training ground with a member of the training staff that was caught on Spanish television, made for some intense speculation about the player's future. In the run-up to the 2008–09 campaign, he suffered a serious injury while playing for the Ivory Coast against Guinea on 20 August, and a subsequent scan showed he had suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in his left leg. He underwent surgery to repair the damage the following week, returning to training in February 2009.|$|E

The {{northern}} and southern walls were buttressed and the eastern wall has three apses. The Survey of Western Palestine related in 1875 that there were Greek inscriptions on one of the steps leading to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> the southern wall while on the floor was a broken stone slab marked by two Maltese crosses, apparently resembling a tombstone. Further slabs and Greek inscriptions were found {{in the eastern part of}} the mosque and in the courtyard.

500|$|The {{church is}} entered through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> {{the west side}} of the tower, with modern double doors between the tower and the nave set into a plain square doorway dating from the 17th or 18th century. [...] The nave is 27feet 9inches by 13feet 8inches (8.5 by 4.2m). Between the nave and the chancel there is a plain round arch, from the 11th or 12th century, a step up, and a rail. At the east end of the chancel, there is a further step up from the chapel into the sanctuary, which has some 18th-century gravestones set into it. The late 15th-century chancel, which {{measures}} 32feet 6inches by 14feet (9.9 by 4.3m), has some memorials from the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Morrison shot and critically wounded himself soon thereafter, simultaneously being shot by police, and died at the scene at 3:57 p.m. Keyes was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Denver, where she was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. The other hostage survived with no physical injuries. Investigators found no sign of explosives in the man's backpack, but three additional firearms were recovered outside the school campus: a Colt AR-15 assault rifle found in a clearing adjacent to a river about a mile north of the school, a Browning bolt-action rifle found north of the campus near U.S. Route 285, and a Smith & Wesson [...]44-caliber revolver found south of the school near a hiking trail.|$|E

500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife.

A man who answered <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>at</b> the Liu home referred questions to the government." [...] The survivors were interviewed by the state-run press, however. In one such interview, CCTV interviewed the 12-year-old Liu Siying. Government sources reported Liu Siying had undergone a tracheotomy shortly before the interview. Speaking through approved media outlets, she said that her own mother told her to set herself on fire to reach the [...] "heavenly golden kingdom"; journalist Danny Schechter doubted that the child {{would have been able to}} speak to the Chinese media so soon after a tracheotomy, yet Liu Siying appeared to be speaking clearly and singing in the interview.|$|E
