40|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) {{is a rare}} {{inborn error}} of {{metabolism}} that affects the ability of patients to metabolise phenylalanine (Phe). Lifelong management of blood Phe levels is {{required in order to}} avoid the complications associated with PKU. This constitutes a severely protein restricted diet, and regular monitoring of Phe levels. Management of PKU may be costly and time-consuming for adult patients or caregivers of PKU-affected children. A cross-sectional study was performed with patients or their caregivers in the Netherlands to gain insight into the personal <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> and cost of living with PKU. A systematic literature review was performed to identify all aspects of PKU management that may pose a financial or <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> on patients or caregivers. Findings were confirmed through interviews with PKU experts and feedback from patients and caregivers, and consolidated into a questionnaire that aimed to evaluate the impact of each of these factors. Early and continuously treated adult patients and caregivers from seven metabolic centres were recruited to complete the questionnaire online. 22 adult patients and 24 caregivers participated in the study. Managing a Phe-restricted diet represented an extra <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> of 1 h and 24 min for caregivers and 30 min for adult patients per day. Caregivers reported a significantly higher <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> than adult patients. The median total out-of-pocket cost (OOPC) for patients was € 604 annually, with 99 % of expenditure on low-protein food products.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} two questions: what role {{infrastructures}} {{can play in}} promoting paid work opportunities for women and what specific type of infrastructure can reduce women's <b>time</b> <b>burden?</b> The study brings empirical evidence on these two questions in a specific country context. Findings from an econometric model that endogenises women's paid and unpaid work show that the impacts of infrastructure on women's work and total <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> depend {{on the type of}} a particular infrastructure and availability of other infrastructures. While hard infrastructure shows significant influence on women's work with a lag, a rise in paid work outside home has not been equally compensated by a decline in unpaid work at home. The findings have important policy implications in infrastructure policy design and provision. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Recruitment {{rates of}} general {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{to do research}} vary widely. This {{may be related to}} the ability of a study to incorporate incentives for GPs and minimise barriers to participation. Method: A convenience sample of 30 GPs, ten each from the Sydney intervention and control groups Ageing in General Practice 'Detection and Management of Dementia' project (GP project) and 10 GPs who had refused participation, were recruited to determine incentives and barriers to participating in research. GPs completed the 11 -item 'Meeting the challenges of research in general practice: general practitioner questionnaire' (GP survey) between months 15 and 24 of the GP project, and received brief qualitative interviews from a research GP to clarify responses where possible. Results: The most important incentives the 30 GPs gave for participating in the project were a desire to update knowledge (endorsed by 70 %), to help patients (70 %), and altruism (60 %). Lack of time (43 %) was the main barrier. GPs also commented on excessive paperwork and an inadequate explanation of research. Conclusions: While a desire to update knowledge and help patients as well as altruism were incentives, <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> was the primary barrier and was likely related to extensive paperwork. Future recruitment may be improved by minimising <b>time</b> <b>burden,</b> making studies simpler with online data entry, offering remuneration and using a GP recruiter...|$|E

40|$|PurposeTo {{examine the}} <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> of {{managing}} neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) imposed on physicians, staff, patients, and caregivers. DesignMixed-methods, prospective, observational time-and-motion study. MethodsThe multicenter {{study was conducted}} from March 2011 through August 2012. Retina specialists administering ≥ 50 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) –inhibitor injections monthly were surveyed and completed records for ≥ 5 patients scheduled for office visits within 3  weeks for anti-VEGF injection or monitoring. A survey was administered to 75 neovascular AMD patients aged ≥ 50 years who received ≥ 1 anti-VEGF injection in the past 6  months. Telephone {{interviews were conducted with}} 13 neovascular AMD patient caregivers. ResultsFifty-six physicians provided data for 221 patients with neovascular AMD. Patients accounted for 20 % of the health care staff's time per week, with an average of 23 staff members. An average patient visit for neovascular AMD was 90  minutes (range: 13  minutes to > 4 hours). Patients reported an average time per visit of almost 12 hours, including preappointment preparation (16  minutes), travel (66  minutes), waiting time (37  minutes), treatment time (43  minutes), and postappointment recovery (9 hours). Patients stated that caregivers took time away from work (22 %) and personal activities (28 %) to provide transportation to appointments. ConclusionsNeovascular AMD management imposes a substantial <b>time</b> <b>burden</b> on physicians, staff, patients, and caregivers.

The object is to understand the impact of labor constraints to collective action. There are three main results.

Second, the gendered nature of work imposes a high burden on women and hence impedes their ability to participate in collective management even if incentives exist. In addition, lower access to social infrastructure further increases work burdens and decreases ability to participate. Finally, high levels of wealth lead to lower individual participation but this not because of high opportunity of time worked. ...|$|E

40|$|Poor {{complementary}} feeding {{practices have}} detrimental effects on child growth, development and survival. This cross-sectional study {{in rural areas}} of southern Benin examined some determinants of complementary feeding practices using socioeconomic and dietary data collected among 1225 primary caregivers. Determinants of complementary feeding practices in the study areas are multidimensional and include many interacting factors such as socio-economic aspects, farming practices, household demographics, cultural practices and geography. Child age, diversity of food groups produced, income allocated to feeding, commune of residence, ethnicity, caregivers’ occupation, marital status and household size were identified as the main factors affecting complementary feeding practices. Food group diversification in farm-systems and overall social behavior and support as well as women’s empowerment are necessary to improve children’s diets. Reducing women’s workload through improved working conditions appears crucial to decrease <b>time</b> <b>burdens</b> and allow more time for child care.

Results show that caregivers are mostly affected by a <b>time</b> dependence <b>burden.</b> Other factors associated with caregiver burden, such as developmental, physical, social and emotional burden are found, but few caregivers are affected by these types.

To this end, we evaluated retrospectively player medical records from the team, which included name, date of birth, position, date of injury, mechanism of injury, and type of injury.
