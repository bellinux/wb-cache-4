40|$|Is it {{possible}} to make platinum particles with a diameter of less than eight nanometres? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> Jan Marijnissen at the aerosol lab of Delft ChemTech was asked. Together with graduate student Jan van Erven, the famous aerosol expert Sheldon Friedlander of the University of California (UCLA), and the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, Marijnissen set out to experiment. He managed to do achieve this by using his favourite electrospray method.

40|$|Who owns Zora Neale Hurston? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{asked in}} 1990 by Michele Wallace, in an {{analysis}} {{of the ways in which}} Hurston has been appropriated by later scholars. Wallace's pungent comparison of later critics to so many 'groupies descending on Elvis Presley's estate' in their haste to turn Hurston to their own purposes strikes a cautionary note for any subsequent writer. As she notes, the risk of canonization <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work will <b>be</b> misused to derail the future of blackwomen in literature and literary criticism. For Wallace, Harold's introduction to his Modern Critical Views anthology of 1986 is a case in point. This article is copyright 2003 MHRA, and is included in this repository with permission...|$|R

60|$|Now {{what this}} {{justifying}} righteousness should be, and when imputed, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> I say, {{it is the}} righteousness or the obedience of the Son of God in the flesh, which he assumed, and so his own, and the righteousness of no body else, otherwise than by imputation.|$|E

40|$|Why {{would one}} {{initiate}} an academic study on flight training entry standards? <b>The</b> skies <b>were</b> closed to aircraft –- not inappropriately – {{in the immediate}} aftermath of the horrific spectacle of September 11, 2001. A quick and furious effort followed to cast an impenetrable protective net over the nation – but how best to achieve <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> While aviators have never been eager to have their privileges to exercise their passion to fly restricted, perhaps the events of that day necessitated asking them whether there should be more stringent entry standards imposed on those who would learn how to take to the sky. So, the study began. Understanding the issues required scrutinizing the multi-faceted development of aviation: its history, its regulatory framework and authorities, its economic impact, the effect of other aviation events, and the changes aviation brought to our lives. <b>The</b> project <b>was</b> inordinately time-consuming, and would not have <b>been</b> possible without <b>the</b> help of many people.

500|$|Brownlee {{attempted}} to leverage {{his relationship with}} King to win provincial control of natural resources.

40|$|A {{young woman}} in Australia was sent by her {{employer}} to a country town. She checked into a motel, {{and set up a}} meeting with a male friend, who happened to live in the town. They had a nice dinner, and then went back to the woman’s motel room. There, they proceeded to have sex; and while this was going on—her male friend testified <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> “going hard” at it and were “rolling around”—a glass light fixture above <b>the</b> bed <b>was</b> somehow pulled from its mount. It fell on the woman, and she suffered injuries to her nose and mouth; she also (she claimed) suffered from a depression as a result, which forced her to stop work. She put in a claim for workers’ compensation, which her employer resisted. Should the woman recover damages for her injuries? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> posed to a series of courts in Australia who heard her claim. Eventually, the woman won her case. This result might seem odd to some readers, but in fact it is consistent with American workers’ compensation law.

30|$|Together, {{with the}} {{observed}} negative return differential over short horizons, CIP implies that hedging currency risk entails a significant cost for a Swiss investor.

We {{are more concerned with}} the impact of hedging on returns, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> on <b>the</b> <b>question</b> whether over time the protection against large exchange rate movements justifies the hedging costs.|$|R
