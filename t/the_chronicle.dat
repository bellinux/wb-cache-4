5|$|Vladimir's reign is {{recounted in}} Chapter 36 of <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> of the Priest of Duklja, {{completed}} between 1299 and 1301; Chapters 34 and 35 {{deal with his}} father and uncles. These three chapters of <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> are most likely based on a lost biography of Vladimir written in Duklja sometime between 1075 and 1089. Both <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> and the 11th-century Byzantine historian John Skylitzes described Vladimir as a wise, pious, just, and peaceful ruler.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>chronicle,</b> the Byzantines {{attempted}} to poison Oleg, but the Rus' leader demonstrated his oracular powers {{by refusing to}} drink the cup of poisoned wine.

Although Byzantine sources did not record these hostilities, the text of the treaty survives in <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Áed's death, {{there is}} a two-decade gap until the death of DonaldII (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is {{reported}} in the Irish annals. The entry for the reign between Áed and DonaldII is corrupt in <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> of the Kings of Alba, {{and in this case}} <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> is at variance with every other king list. According to <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle,</b> Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although {{it has been suggested that}} he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> {{indirectly}} {{implies that}} Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. <b>The</b> <b>chronicle</b> records that because Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. <b>The</b> <b>chronicle</b> states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern of}} <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. <b>The</b> <b>chronicle</b> also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. <b>The</b> <b>chronicle</b> also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E

5|$|Despite the uncertainly {{surrounding}} {{the inception of}} his reign, <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced continued opposition from within his own family {{in the form of}} an ongoing rebellion by his brother, Haraldr. Lǫgmaðr eventually overcame Haraldr, however, and is stated to have had the latter blinded and emasculated. Afterwards, if <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> is to be believed, Lǫgmaðr repented the cruelty that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom, before setting off to Jerusalem, where he died.|$|E
5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson's reign {{was not a}} long one. In 1250, <b>the</b> <b>chronicle</b> {{records that}} he was summoned by letter to the Norwegian royal court because Hákon was displeased at how Haraldr Guðrøðarson had wrongfully seized the kingship which was not his by right. <b>The</b> <b>chronicle</b> notes that the Norwegian king {{intended}} that Haraldr Guðrøðarson should never return to Mann, and he was consequently kept from returning to the island-kingdom. Nothing further is heard from him.|$|E

However, these sources, excepting the Brief History by Nikephoros, and the Christian Arab Agapius of Hierapolis all likely drew their information from a common source, probably the 8th-century historian Theophilos of Edessa.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a {{collection}} of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The original manuscript of <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> was created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> was still being actively updated in 1154.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chronicle</b> is not unbiased: {{there are}} {{occasions}} when {{comparison with other}} medieval sources {{makes it clear that}} the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> {{is the single most important}} historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in <b>the</b> <b>Chronicle</b> is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.|$|E
