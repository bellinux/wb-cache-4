5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{formed on}} November9 {{to the east}} of Diego Garcia, possibly the result of the MJO. A circulation was evident by November11, and the following day it developed into Tropical Disturbance 2 about 830km (515mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. Also on November12, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 02S. It moved to the southwest, but looped back to the east on November13, during which time the MFR upgraded it to tropical depression status. Later that day, the agency ceased issuing advisories, but the system reorganized on November14. On November17, it <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest, but the MFR discontinued advisories on the next day.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January19 off {{the east}} coast of Madagascar, which became Tropical Disturbance 6 two days later. It drifted to the east, strengthening to tropical depression status on January22, and passing 330km (205mi) west of Réunion. Increased wind shear caused the system to weaken as it <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, dissipating over Madagascar on January24. On Réunion, the system dropped about 100mm (4in) of rainfall, including a total of 50mm (2in) falling in a 90minute period in Cape Bernard.|$|E

5|$|Andres {{originated}} from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm {{status as a}} second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After {{a brief period of}} a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Daisy {{brought the}} worst {{flooding}} to New England since Hurricane Diane in 1955. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1962 Atlantic hurricane season, Daisy developed from a tropical disturbance located well {{east of the}} Leeward Islands on September29. Initially a tropical depression, it headed west-northwestward and failed to strengthen significantly. While located {{a short distance from}} the Leeward Islands, the depression curved northwestward and began intensifying. On October2, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Daisy. Around that time, the storm <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest and continued to deepen. Daisy reached hurricane status late on October3. Two days later, it became a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, but briefly weakened back to a Category1 on October6.|$|E

5|$|On January3, the BoM and the JTWC ceased issuing {{advisories}} on Tropical Cyclone Phil in the Australian region, which previously {{moved over}} Western Australia. The system continued to the west, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on January5. On January8, {{the remnants of}} Phil slowed {{and turned to the}} southeast. The next day, the JTWC began reissuing advisories on Phil. The storm meandered and executed a small loop, and in the process reached peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). Phil <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest, and the JTWC ceased issuing advisories on January12. Four days later, the circulation dissipated. Also in January, the JTWC briefly tracked Tropical Cyclone 18S from the Australian region, which entered the south-west Indian Ocean on January12. At that time, the storm had peak 1minute winds of 85km/h (50mph), although it quickly weakened and dissipated on January13.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Tropical Storm Allison in Texas {{included}} 23 deaths caused by extreme flooding. The first storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Allison lasted unusually {{long for a}} June storm, remaining tropical or subtropical for 15days. The storm developed from a tropical wave in the northern Gulf of Mexico on June 4, 2001, and struck the northern Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, made landfall on Louisiana, then moved across the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the first storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the effects}} of a larger upper-level low, Juan slowed on October 28 while {{approaching}} the Louisiana coastline. At 1200 UTC that day, the hurricane attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). After executing a loop just offshore southern Louisiana, Juan <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, making landfall at peak intensity near Morgan City at 1100 UTC on October 29. Subsequently, Juan turned sharply to the northwest, executing another loop over southern Louisiana near Lafayette. Late on October 29, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, emerging into Vermilion Bay early the next day with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Juan turned to the east, moving along the southern Louisiana coast and re-organizing slightly.|$|E

5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
5|$|Ando rapidly {{intensified}} after forming and attained {{tropical cyclone}} status early on January4, developing an {{eye in the}} center of the thunderstorms and outflow to the east. A tropical low over the southern Mozambique Channel weakened the ridge, causing Ando to turn more to the southwest. Late on January4, the storm intensified further into an intense tropical cyclone, and early the next day passed about 120km (75mi) northeast of Tromelin Island. According to the JTWC, however, Ando attained peak 1minute winds of 220km/h (140mph) late on January5. In contrast, the MFR assessed Ando as weakening due to the becoming larger and less defined, while still maintaining a small cloud diameter of about 400km (250mi). However, the eye re-organized, and Ando attained peak 10minute winds of 195km/h (120mph) on January6, with a 60km (35mi) eye at the time. Continuing around the ridge, the cyclone passed about 205km (125mi) west of Réunion that day before starting to weaken due to increased wind shear. On January8, Ando weakened below tropical cyclone status, and the convection increasingly separated from the circulation while turning to the southeast. On January10, the storm became extratropical, although the remnants <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest due to the ridge, dissipating on January13.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{a massive}} crowd of {{thousands}} of Chinese soldiers and civilians from {{the south side of}} Nanking, who were fleeing in panic and disarray from the advance of Japan's 10th Army on the same night, were prevented from reaching the harbor at Xiaguan by Chinese barrier troops who fired on the crowd for retreating without permission and managed to hold it back. At 9:00 pm a fleeing Chinese tank unit, which had also not received Tang's parting message, charged the barrier troops and burst through their blockade, only for the crowd to then find that there were hardly any boats remaining in the harbor. The crowd fought to clamber aboard what few craft were available, but these soon became so overloaded that they sank midway. The rest of the Chinese soldiers took to the Yangtze's rough and frigid waters en masse while clinging to logs and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly swallowed up by the river. Furthermore, by this point the Japanese encirclement of Nanking was virtually complete and many who were attempting to brave the Yangtze soon found themselves being fired upon {{from both sides of the}} river.

5|$|Hurricane Felix caused severe beach erosion {{along the}} East Coast of the United States in August1995. The seventh {{tropical}} cyclone, sixth named storm, and third hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Felix developed from a tropical wave {{in the eastern}} Atlantic Ocean on August8. Although initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day. Further intensification was slow, with Felix reaching hurricane status on August11. Under favorable conditions, Felix began to rapidly deepen while curving northwestward. Late on August12, Felix peaked as a low-end Category4 hurricane. However, it soon weakened rapidly to a Category1 hurricane. Less than three days later, Felix passed only 75mi (120km) southeast of Bermuda. Although it also posed {{a threat to the}} East Coast of the United States, Felix curved northward and then east-northeastward while remaining offshore, thereby avoiding landfall. Felix briefly threatened Bermuda again, but weakened to a tropical storm and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast on August20. It accelerated east-northeastward, and passed a short distance offshore of Newfoundland, where Felix transitioned into an extratropical storm on August22.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and {{turn back to}} the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an eye. On the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on the next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} system {{developed on}} February28 in the Australian region south of February28, and moved westward. On March7, the JTWC initiated advisories {{on the system}} as Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65km/h (40mph) the next day. Soon after, the system weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward along {{the northern edge of}} a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March16. That day, it <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed to develop more, but after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March16, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, the {{intensification}} {{became more}} rapid and Helene {{quickly became a}} Category2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection. Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic, which {{was in response to}} a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north. The northward turn shifted the course away from any land areas. The intensification continued through the afternoon, and that evening, Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962mbar. As shear remained low and the oceans remained warm, Helene intensified slightly more, peaking as a solid Category3 hurricane with 120mph (195km/h) winds early on September 18. At that time, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean. Operationally, Helene was estimated to have had 125mph (205km/h) winds, but the post-storm analysis downgraded it slightly. As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th, a narrow ridge built in, forcing Helene westward. The eyewall collapsed somewhat, and Helene weakened slightly to a Category2 hurricane, where it leveled off for about 48hours until September 20 due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern. On the 20th, Helene <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest and weakened slightly due to a slight increase in wind shear. That afternoon, it was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane, which Helene remained until becoming extratropical.|$|E
5|$|The local Norman {{population}} {{sought refuge}} in the castle {{to escape from the}} French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non-combatants were allowed inside, increasing {{the number of people in}} the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle's supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege-lines. The idea was to keep as many people as possible within Château Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Château Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. Such treatment of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418–1419, both in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few hours}} of developing, the {{depression}} quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Manuel. By early on September14, an eye feature developed as rainbands increased. However, Manuel was embedded within a broad weather system that extended from the eastern Pacific across Mexico, which included Hurricane Ingrid in the Bay of Campeche on the Gulf of Mexico coast. The broad system, including Manuel, moved generally northward. By early on September15, Manuel had developed a central dense overcast, with a 17mi (28km) wide eye in the center. Based on the structure and satellite-intensity estimates, the NHC estimated Manuel attained secondary peak winds of , just shy of hurricane status. The agency noted the potential for further strengthening into a hurricane, citing the warm waters, moist environment, and low shear. A break in the subtropical ridge to the north allowed the storm to initially continue generally to the north-northeast, but after attaining its secondary peak, Manuel <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest while accelerating. On September15, Manuel made landfall near Aquila in Michoacán as a high-end tropical storm, though operationally, it was believed to have moved ashore near Manzanillo in Colima. Early on September16, the storm weakened into a tropical depression after the circulation became disrupted, although it continued dropping heavy rainfall. Later that day, the surface center dissipated over western Mexico.|$|E
