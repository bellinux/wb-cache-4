50|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Degnan opposed plans by Putnam County to expand Brewster's social {{services}} center, expressing concern that an expanded center would exacerbate illegal immigration in the village and require taxpayers <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> for services provided to non-taxpaying day laborers. In 2000, though Degnan estimated that 300 day laborers could be found on the streets of Brewster in a given day, he again opposed a proposal by the Putnam County executive to construct a day laborer hiring center in Brewster for similar reasons. In time, Degnan would come to view a hiring center as a way to reduce the loitering and crime which many village associated with day laborers.But in 2000, he remained opposed.|$|E

5000|$|Monday February 9, the Dutch Ondernemingskamer {{denied the}} request from Euroshareholders to force Fortis to also allow the February 13 meeting (at Utrecht) {{to vote on}} the sales. In an {{analysis}} by De Standaard it is pointed out that the campaign by the Belgian government to scare the shareholders into voting in favor is not without risk. It creates the spectre of Fortis Bank being in trouble, and this may affect the image of the bank, just now when Fortis Bank is doing well (with liquidity problems a thing of the past). What is actually at stake is the creditability of the Belgian government, especially financially; it may need <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> and the more it scares financiers, the higher the interests they will demand. Nevertheless, the government appears committed to a policy of punishing the shareholders (for not supervising the board of Fortis or for speculating by buying Fortis shares) and protecting the customers.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was called}} to Vietnam 1968 from the Middle East…While I as in Spain route, I bought some Joan Baez records.

He was a one-star brigadier general. He outranked me by far.He said, “You a fan Joan Baez?”I said, “How many records do you have to have to be a fan?”He said, “I guess three.”I said, “I guess I’m a fan. I’ve got five.”He said, “You have to get rid of the records or leave the building.”I couldn’t believe it.I said, “I can’t play the music I want, music that was made in the USA?”He said, “No, you’ll have to leave the building. That’s anti-military music.” She was singing “With God on Our Side”, I think, at the time.I said, “I think I agree with lyrics. I’m not anti-military, and I agree with what she’s singing in her songs.”He said, “You’ll have to leave the building.”I said, “Hey, it’s okay with me.”So he gave me a transfer…I went down to the Hilton Castille in Madrid and I stayed in one of the best rooms they had, and the government had <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The late 1890s {{reconstruction}} of the ship canal resulted in the replacement of this tower and the fog signal house with a single brick lighthouse containing both signals. This house, constructed of Cream City brick, was completed in 1901, and the new tower was first lit on September 1 of that year. This tower stood on {{the southeast corner of}} the rectangular building, and housed the lens retained from the old light; the fog whistles and their reflector were also moved from the old structure to the new. The latter were replaced in 1915 with locomotive whistles, and in 1921 with Type F diaphones, setting off another round of noise complaints, which led to the installation of a new sound reflector. The diaphones were replaced in 1968 with an electronic horn, but in 1976 a group styling itself TOOT (for [...] "reTurn Our Old Tone") began a campaign to restore the fog signal. Horns from the Kewaunee Pierhead Light were obtained, and in 1995 the diaphones were put back in service, eliciting, of course, a new round of noise complaints, which led to restriction of the signal to daytime operation. The signal required a three-phase current supply for operation, and when this failed in 2005, the Coast Guard refused to pay for repairs; legal concerns led the city to refuse <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> and the signal was dismantled the following year. The light, however, continues in service, displaying a fixed green light.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the wide}} {{approval}} of the original garden-like scheme, by July 1968 the plan had been scrapped in favour of a scheme by Montreal developers Yale Properties that would provide more revenue. As the municipal government hashed out the overall construction cost to build the original plan, controversy stirred amongst officials of CMHC who were under pressure by the federal minister to stop providing money. By October 1968, CMHC had given out approximately $168 million to various Canadian municipalities to upgrade their built infrastructure, but after multiple complaints from watchdog groups and government officials over the casual administrative process and its inability to control the expenditure of private contractors,federal Urban Affairs Minister Robert Andres was forced to halt activities. Ultimately CMHC reverted to its pre-1964 role, which was solely to provide capital resources to create or redevelop residential addresses. Hamilton, therefore, lost its ability to apply or even negotiate for further grants and, as greater pressure {{was placed on the}} municipality <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> city planners disregarded the gardens and pools of the original plan and looked towards a scheme that would require a minimum amount of funding and produce a maximum amount of revenue for their investment. Yale Properties quickly swooped in and consolidated the originally dispersed commercial and civic components and locked them into two large super-blocks (figures 3 and 4), connected by an indoor mall with no outdoor frontage. High barren walls of brown concrete would line most of the expanded King Street West and all civic components were pushed onto a public square located above the mall and away from the street. The city and developer faced heavy opposition from the citizens who were promised open space, gardens, and long pools of fresh water, but all complaints either went unheeded or were quickly deflected by promises of civic festivals and facilities above the mall complex on the piazza roof or enclosed indoors.|$|E

I bristled. “What do you mean? That's a worn-out stereotype. My wife and I are not rich, and we're Jewish [...] . ” I proceeded to give her a brief anti-stereotyping primer to which she responded with interest. I was reassured. A few moments later, however, I faced a predicament. The bill for lunch arrived and, unfamiliar with realtor-client etiquette, I considered picking up the tab.

40|$|Mute Vol 2 # 6 This {{issue we}} look at the cultural, {{political}} and social costs of an era of debt-backed boom now showing signs of busting. Our contributors explore the links between a global glut of financial liquidity and the capitalist self-cannibalisation that sustains it. Tracing the impact of financialised and looted social existence from the micropolitics of student debt and lifelong labour, via the reign of fictitious capital, to the geopolitics of US militarism and reactionary anti-imperialism, this issue asks us to reimagine crisis as a political question with an open outcome: Are we about <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab</b> for the financial elite's decades long free lunch ?

40|$|The Scenario Consider three cryptographers {{who have}} just {{finished}} a meal in a rather swish restaurant. The cryptographers {{want to know whether}} the NSA will have <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab,</b> or whether one of their number is willing to foot bill. An additional condition is that the cryptographer who pays wishes to inform her colleagues anonymously. In [1], a protocol was proposed to solve this problem. The Protocol The cryptographers are arranged around a circular table and position their menus as shown in figure 1. Each cryptographer flips a coin behind their menu such that only the colleague to their right can see the result. Each cryptographer then compares their coin with that visible to their left and states whether the coins match. However, if (at most) one of the cryptographers is paying for the meal, then they state the opposite of what they see. If the number of disagreements is even then the NSA is paying. Otherwise a cryptographer is paying. Why it Works The table below illustrates the number of disagreements for any combination of the three cryptographer’s flips. Notice that the number of disagreements is always even since, beginning from all 0 ’s a change by one cryptographer will result in a change of exactly 2 in the number of disagreements. Therefore, if all cryptographers are honest then there are always an even number of disagreements. However, if exactly one cryptographer states the opposite of what they see, then the number of disagreements will be odd. The source code listing below implements the dining cryptographer’s problem. It can be seen that this property holds regardless of the number of cryptographers having dinner. See [1] for the full paper...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction: When {{pondering the}} {{question}} of the “sustainable corporation,” as we did in this symposium, one of the intractable problems {{is the nature of the}} corporation to produce externalities. By noting this characteristic, I am not making a moral point but an economic one. The nature of the firm is to create financial wealth by producing goods and services for profit; without regulatory or contractual limits, the firm has every incentive to externalize costs onto those whose interests are not included in the firm’s current financial calculus. In fact, because of the corporation’s tendency to create benefits for itself by pushing costs onto others, the corporation could aptly be called an “externality machine. ” The obvious kind of externality is the one that happens in the same time frame as the benefits gained. These current externalities take a number of forms. A company might refuse to provide health benefits to its employees, leaving Medicare or Medicaid <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>tab.</b> The company might save on production costs by skirting environmental laws, thereby forcing communities, neighbors, or employees to suffer risks of harm that do not need to be accounted for on the company’s financial statements. Alternatively, the company could sell shoddy products to one-time purchasers, produce goods in sweatshops, or underfund employees’ pension funds. These kinds of externalities are routine to notice and remark on. They are also the subject of some push-back from stakeholders and regulators. Those who bear the cost can assert their interests in various ways. The more difficult kind of externality to address—especially if our focus is on the sustainability of the corporation—is the future externality. What I mean here is the kind of cost that a corporation’s management can externalize to the future. From management’s perspective, the future is a much more attractive place to push off costs. Stakeholders who must bear such future costs will be less aware of those costs than current costs, and even if they do learn of such future costs, they will be less able to gain the attention of regulators. The aim of this Essay is to ask about one particular kind of future externality: future costs to shareholders. I recognize that shareholders are not usually the focus in a discussion of externalities. In the present, their interests are sufficiently (even if not perfectly) aligned with those of management that we need not concern ourselves with externalities borne by shareholders other than through the usual corporate governance tools. But in the case of future externalities, the analysis is more complex. Current shareholders may prioritize present returns over future returns, and current shareholders may not expect to be future shareholders at all. This means that corporate managers have incentives not only to externalize costs to current and future stakeholders whose interests they can ignore but also to future shareholders as well. This means that corporations will, by their very natures, be fixated on the short term...|$|E
