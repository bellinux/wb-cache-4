40|$|Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a {{theoretical}} framework, this study evaluated a 4 -month, individual cognitive-behavioral intervention program to decrease burnout and increase self-efficacy, engagement, and performance among university students. The main {{objective of the}} intervention was to decrease the anxiety the students coped with before exams {{in order to increase}} their beliefs of self-efficacy. Besides <b>the</b> study group <b>intervened,</b> two control groups were involved (i. e., a ‘‘stressed’’ control group and a ‘‘healthy’’ control group). All 3 groups filled out a questionnaire before the intervention and then again 6 months later (2 months after the intervention was completed). The results show that self-efficacy, engagement and performance increased in <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> group when compared to both control groups. Regarding burnout, decreases were noted in both <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> and stressed control groups but not in the healthy control group. The implications of the study are discussed, together with its limitations and suggestions for future researc...|$|R

30|$|Respondents {{mentioned}} that livestock number {{was the best}} indicator for evaluating rangeland condition in Afar region. The existing empirical evidence based on metrological data did not show any significant decline in precipitation {{for the last four}} decades between 1971 and 2011 as opposed to the perception of pastoralists where 80 % of them reported a decline in precipitation. A one unit increase in labor force suggested about 16.1 % decrease in the choice of livestock selling as coping strategy in Afar pastoral areas of North-East of Ethiopia. The non-intervened pastoral households had more preference (3.78 %) to practice herd splitting than those pastoral households in <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> district. Similarly, <b>the</b> non-intervened pastoral households had 4.43 % more preference to use crop residue for livestock feeding than pastoral HHs in <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> areas.|$|R
30|$|The {{estimated}} {{coefficient of}} most coping strategies towards {{failure of the}} SRS showed a negative relationship {{with the number of}} labor force found at a household level. However, significance difference was observed between the different rainy seasons in terms of coping strategies that had used for the failure of rainfall. Mobility + selling showed a significant relationship with an estimated coefficient of − 1.61 (P[*]=[*] 0.008) (Table 1). An isolated one unit increase in labor force showed about 16.1 % decrease in the choice of livestock selling as a coping strategy. Differences in the study area in terms of adaptation showed a significant relationship in all coping strategies except mobility + slaughtering with an estimated coefficient of 3.93 (P[*]=[*] 0.00). This showed that the non-intervened pastoral HHs had about 39.3 % more choices to use mobility + looping and feeding than <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> pastoral HHs (Table 1). In addition, other coping strategies also showed a significant relationship with the type of the study area. The estimated coefficient of the study area for mobility + herd splitting is 3.78 (P[*]=[*] 0.04), which showed non-intervened pastorals HHs with 37.8 % more preference to use mobility + herd splitting than <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> pastoral HHs (Table 1). Similarly, the estimated coefficient of 4.43 (P[*]=[*] 0.01) showed that the non-intervened pastoral HHS had about 44.3 % more preference than <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> pastoral HHs (Table 1).|$|R

40|$|Background: "Strong Families" is {{a family}} program aimed at {{preventing}} risk behaviors in adolescents from 10 to 14 years of age. It has been developed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) {{and is based on}} the Iowa Strengthening Families Program. This program has been certified and has been proven to effectively prevent adolescent drug and alcohol abuse in several countries around the globe. Aim: To evaluate the Strong Families Program toward adjusting current parenting styles, aiming to decrease risk behaviors in Chilean adolescents. Material and Methods: A quasi-experimental study involving 120 families, selected from 6 schools within the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. A group of 129 adolescents and 124 parents were chosen by convenience to be intervened. A control group of 223 adolescents and 165 parents were not <b>intervened.</b> <b>The</b> families that underwent intervention attended to 7 educational sessions. <b>The</b> <b>intervened</b> and control groups were evaluated before intervention as well as 6 months after intervention, by means of self-administered evaluation tools. Results: <b>The</b> <b>intervened</b> parents showed significant parenting changes six months after intervention, which resulted in less yelling (p = 0. 007), insults (p = 0. 002) and lack of control when their children misbehaved (p = 0. 008). Regarding the risk behaviors in <b>the</b> <b>intervened</b> and control adolescents, no changes were observed in terms of the consumption rate of tobacco, alcohol or illegal drug use, or in sexual risk behaviors. Conclusions: After six months of intervention, the Program proved to be effective in modifying parenting styles. However, no changes were observed in risk behaviors among adolescents, which could occur within a longer period of time, as reported in other studies...|$|R
5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over <b>the</b> <b>intervening</b> territory between these two areas.
