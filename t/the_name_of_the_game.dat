5|$|Tute {{originated}} in Italy. The game {{belongs to the}} same family as Brisca and has similar rules in gameplay and final count of points. <b>The</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> originated from the Italian word Tutti (all), the declaration that a player announces when holding the four kings. The game spread to Spain during the 19th century, brought back by Spanish troops who returned from missions in Italy. As {{the popularity of the}} game increased, its name was modified over time by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game {{became one of the most}} popular in Spain, leading to the later appearance of regional variations of the game.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon was {{originally}} intended to be an expansion pack to Worms 2, but it was eventually developed as a standalone game. It {{was intended to be}} the last game of the Worms franchise, but Andy Davidson, the creator of Worms, felt that it needed more content before being released, leading to the development of Worms World Party. It was also going to be released under the name Wormageddon, but Team17 changed the name to Worms Armageddon because of close similarities to <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> Carmageddon. It was released initially for PCs in 1999 in Europe and on 31 May 1999 in North America and has since been ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation on 30 November 1999, Game Boy Color on 19 January 2000, and Nintendo 64 on 30 March 2000. The Nintendo 64 version {{is one of the first}} Nintendo 64 games to feature a terrain editor and generator. A Macintosh version was being developed by MacSoft, but it has since been cancelled. Worms Armageddon was produced by Martyn Brown and composed by Bjørn Lynne, Karl Morton was the game's lead programmer, and Dan Cartwright was the game's lead artist.|$|E

Before development began, when even <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was undecided, the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller said they wanted a [...] "natural flow" [...] from the first game to the sequel. As Myst {{proved to be a}} popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers. Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; Riven had a budget of between US$5and $10million, more than ten times the cost of developing Myst.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of Grabbed by the Ghoulies began {{after the release}} of Conker's Bad Fur Day. The idea for the game began with the name, which is a pun on [...] "goolies", a British slang term for [...] "testicles". According to designer Gregg Mayles, <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> materialised after he overheard someone mention [...] "being grabbed by the goolies", and thought that it would make a suitable name for an upcoming Rare game. Before any details of the game were publicised, it was rumoured that Grabbed by the Ghoulies would be the subtitle to the next Conker the Squirrel game. After Microsoft purchased Rare for £375 million in 2002, {{development of}} the game for the GameCube was delayed until Rare converted it to the Xbox console.|$|E
500|$|Zack Johnson, the game's creator, {{developed}} several {{games before}} Kingdom of Loathing {{but did not}} feel that they were good enough to release online. Deciding that he was taking the games he created too seriously, Johnson then set himself the challenge of creating one within a week and publishing the result online. The result was more of a joke than a game, and the initial content including classes and even <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> were stream of consciousness. [...] The game was released in early 2003, and Johnson soon invited his childhood friend Josh Nite to contribute content as a writer and designer. [...] Within a year, 300,000 player accounts had been created, far exceeding Johnson and Nite's expectations; Johnson has referred to the game's success as [...] "a never ending series of astonishments".

500|$|Metroid was {{designed}} to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of Super Mario Bros. with the non-linear exploration of The Legend of Zelda and a distinctly darker aesthetic. <b>The</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is a portmanteau of the words [...] "metro" [...] (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist. Halfway through development of the original Metroid, one of the staff said to his fellow developers [...] "Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the idea was accepted. Ridley Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a [...] "huge influence" [...] after the world of the first Metroid had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe. In recognition of this, a character was given the name Ridley, after director Scott.|$|E
500|$|Asteroids was {{conceived}} by Lyle Rains and programmed by Ed Logg with collaborations from other Atari staff. Logg {{was impressed with}} the Atari 2600 (then known as [...] "Atari Video Computer System") and joined Atari's coin-op division and worked on Dirt Bike, which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test. He developed Super Breakout after hearing that Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, wanted Breakout updated. Paul Mancuso joined the development team as Asteroids technician and engineer Howard Delman contributed to the hardware. During a meeting in April 1979, Rains discussed Planet Grab, a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to Cosmos. Logg did not know <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> thinking Computer Space as [...] "the inspiration for the two-dimensional approach". Rains conceived of Asteroids as a mixture of Computer Space and Space Invaders, combining the two-dimensional approach of Computer Space with Space Invaders addictive gameplay of [...] "completion" [...] and [...] "eliminate all threats". The unfinished game featured a giant, indestructible asteroid, so Rains asked Logg: [...] "Well, why don’t we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up?" [...] In response, Logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces. Both agreed on the concept.|$|E

[...] "The peace-time RAAF was not to his liking", according to McAulay. On 21March 1947, Rawlinson was granted a commission in the RAF as a substantive squadron leader (seniority from 1June 1944) and temporary wing commander (seniority from 1August 1943 until 1November 1947). His initial posting in Britain was at Headquarters Fighter Command (HQFC). [...] Between June and October 1949 he was commanding officer of No.54 Squadron, which operated deHavilland Vampire jet fighters at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. He then served as wing commander (flying) for the Odiham Wing, comprising three Vampire squadrons including No.54, until May 1952. Recalling training for Cold War operations, he said: [...] "The introduction of jet fighters meant, roughly, that speeds were doubled and endurances halved. Precision was <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> ... The aim was to achieve, as close as possible, the maximum effort with day operations in all-weather conditions against the nuclear threat..." [...] Reduced flying hours owing to [...] "budgetary limitations" [...] meant that [...] "as much as possible of the HQFC syllabus was crammed into each sortie".|$|E

500|$|The initial {{idea for}} Kingdom Hearts {{began with a}} {{discussion}} between Shinji Hashimoto and Hironobu Sakaguchi about Super Mario 64. They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like Super Mario 64 but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney's could rival a Mario game. Tetsuya Nomura, overhearing their conversation, volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct. A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator—Square and Disney had previously worked {{in the same building}} in Japan—allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney. Development began in February 2000 with Nomura as director and Hashimoto as producer. While Nomura had done previous work in the Final Fantasy series as monster designer and graphic director, he did not gain widespread recognition until he was the lead character designer for Final Fantasy VII. Kingdom Hearts marked his transition into a directorial position, though he also served as the game's character designer. Scenarios were provided by Kazushige Nojima who was a scenario writer for Square from Final Fantasy VII until he left in 2003. Originally the development focused on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney's target age range. After Kingdom Hearts executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi told Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the Final Fantasy series, he began to develop the story further. In June 2013, Nomura stated <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> came from him thinking about Disney Theme Parks, especially Animal Kingdom. However, Nomura could not get the IP with just [...] "Kingdom", so the development team began to think about [...] "heart" [...] as a core part of the story, so they decided to combine the two to form [...] "Kingdom Hearts".|$|E
500|$|Following {{completion}} of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending {{of the game is}} purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb—"Now we are all sons of bitches"—is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development. Some also refer to <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braids plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as [...] "You must look back to go forwards" [...] as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that {{there is more than one}} interpretation of the story; he [...] "would not be capable" [...] of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is [...] "something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly." [...] Blow considered Braid to be [...] "about the journey, not the destination". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide [...] "a longer-term challenge".|$|E

A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator—Square and Disney had previously worked {{in the same building}} in Japan—allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney. Nomura struck down a number of proposals from Disney in order to pursue his own concept featuring an original character not based on a Disney property. The production team consisted of over one hundred members from both Square and Disney Interactive. The game began development in February 2000 and originally focused more on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney's target age range. After executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi told director Tetsuya Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the Final Fantasy series, Nomura began to develop the story further. When choosing the Disney worlds to include in the game, Nomura and his team tried to pick worlds that had distinctively different looks. They also tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting. Thanks to support from Disney's then-president and current chairman and chief executive Bob Iger, the team had few restrictions on which worlds they could use from the Disney franchises. However, they tried to remain within each character's boundaries set by their respective Disney films. In June 2013, Nomura stated <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> came from him thinking about Disney Theme Parks, especially Animal Kingdom.
