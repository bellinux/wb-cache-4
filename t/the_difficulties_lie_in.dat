40|$|Abstract — Optimal {{spectrum}} {{access is}} a fundamental issue for efficient wireless communications in multi-channel wireless networking systems. Opportunistic spectrum access, making fully use of channels with high quality, could pave a way for efficient transmission. Unfortunately, in heterogeneous wireless networks, these strategies suffer from the assumption of identical wireless channel quality, and <b>the</b> <b>difficulties</b> <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> manipulating between multiple radios and channels. In this paper, we propose a coop-erative and cognitive spectrum access algorithm, so as to build a timely and distributed multi-channel probing and access scheme in heterogeneous wireless network. In modeling the probing problem into a time-constrained knapsack problem, we propose an optimal access scheme considering both channel bandwidth and the probing time. Numerical results and simulation results show that, our proposed timely probing paradigm effectively improves network resource utilization with deadlines. I...|$|E

The service-as-event paradigm is introduced for helping users to describe algorithms as a composition of simple services and/or to decompose them into simple steps.
