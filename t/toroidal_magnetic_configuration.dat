40|$|Where is {{the solar}} dynamo located {{and what is}} its modus operandi? These are still open {{questions}} in solar physics. Helio- and asteroseismology can help answer them by enabling us to study solar and stellar internal structures through global oscillations.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a formalism to calculate the effect of large-scale <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> fields on solar and stellar global oscillation eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies.

The angular velocity of the plasma column has been measured in JET H-mode plasmas with pure ICRF heating both for the standard low <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> ripple <b>configuration,</b> of about similar to 0. 08 % and, for increased ripple values up to 1. 5 % (Nave et al 2010 Phys.

The JET data do not fit well any of these scalings that were derived for plasmas that are co-rotating {{with respect to the}} plasma current. With the standard low ripple configuration, JET plasmas with large ICRF heating power and normalized beta, beta(N) approximate to 1. 3, have a very small co-current rotation, with Alfven-Mach numbers significantly below those given by the rotation scaling of Rice et al (2007 Nucl.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to the study of three dimensional transport in <b>toroidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> induced by the presence of the magnetic islands, which break the nested flux surfaces and make the magnetic field intrinsically three dimensional. The methodology applied is based on defining a certain symmetry so that the transport study could be performed in the approximation of 1. 5 dimensions. The work has been carried out on both RFX-mod Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) and the TJ-II stellarator. RFX-mod is the largest RFP in the world. The RFP configuration is sustained by the so-called dynamo mechanism, which is related to the non-linear interactions among many resonating MHD tearing modes. The transport study on RFX-mod has been performed on the three sub-states identified in the Quasi-Single Helicity regime, that features one single mode (dominant mode) dominating the mode spectrum, {{while the rest of the}} modes (secondary modes) remain at low amplitudes. In this regime proper flux coordinates can be identified considering an equilibrium built on the underlying axi-symmetric magnetic field plus the contribution from the dominant mode. In this way, a 1. 5 dimensional approximation transport study is possible by averaging different physical quantities over the flux surfaces. The transport study is focused on the bean-shaped region where nearly conserved flux surfaces have been identified, on which the formation of steep thermal gradients is observed, interpreted as electron Internal Transport Barrier (eITB). Starting from experimental measurements, both the thermal gradients and the thermal diffusivity have been calculated and their behaviors have been discussed within the framework of stochastic transport. Finally, the energy confinement time has also been evaluated, adopting an improved method with respect to past studies, and the results show a significant improvement. The transport study on TJ-II stellarator focuses on the calculation of the enhanced non-ambipolar radial electric field due to the presence of the magnetic islands. The main idea of the study is that the magnetic islands could modify the toroidal plasma viscosity, giving rise to an enhancement on the non-ambipolar particle fluxes. This work started with the study of the Neoclassical Toroidal Viscosity developed by K. C. Shaing for tokamak configurations, which ideally has a toroidal symmetry. Applying this theory, the particle flux can be expressed as a function of a monotonic radial coordinate and thus the transport study could be performed with a 1. 5 -dimensional approach. A moderate modification on the original theory has been made and the corresponding justification is presented, together with the detailed study in both tokamak and TJ-II configurations. The results show that an 'extra' local radial electric field is indeed induced by the magnetic islands in TJ-II plasmas, which could play a positive role in the plasma confinement properties by affecting the L-H transition, which is believed to be strongly linked to the shear of E x B flow...|$|R
