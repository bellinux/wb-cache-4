2500|$|Talking {{about his}} {{motivation}} {{to get involved}} in the legal proceedings stemming from the assassination of Zoran Đinđić, Popović said in 2013: [...] "First off, I defended Đinđić before. Client always remains a client. To me he symbolizes the 1968 protests, which I see as emancipatory and freeing. I thought him to be a pleasant person, not to mention being intelligent and trying to do something for this country from a minority position with Prometheusesque awareness he probably won't succeed. That's what killed him. The position that the state took was both shameful and scandalous, and I'm not saying I've proven the guilt of Koštunica, Čović, and Aco Tomić, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> facts warrant at least their investigative questioning".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} decade the study of autoimmunity, the failure to {{recognize}} self antigens as [...] "self," [...] has grown immensely. Autoimmunity is thought by many researchers to {{be a result of}} a loss of immunological tolerance, the ability for an individual to discriminate between self and non-self, though others are beginning to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> autoimmune diseases are due to mutations governing programmed cell death, or to environmental products that injure target tissues, thus causing a release of immunostimulatory alarm signals,. Growth in the field of autoimmunity has resulted in more and more frequent diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Consequently, recent data show that autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1 in 31 people within the general population. Growth has also led to a greater characterization of what autoimmunity is and how it can be studied and treated. With an increased amount of research, there has been tremendous growth {{in the study of the}} several different ways in which autoimmunity can occur, one of which is molecular mimicry. The mechanism by which pathogens have evolved, or obtained by chance, similar amino acid sequences or the homologous three-dimensional crystal structure of immunodominant epitopes remains a mystery.|$|E

5000|$|No, {{this is not}} an indecent proposal. It's an idea to add {{a little}} feature to Nupedia. Jimmy Wales <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> people might find the idea objectionable, but I think not... As to Nupedia's use of a wiki, this is the ULTIMATE [...] "open" [...] and simple format for {{developing}} content. We have occasionally bandied about ideas for simpler, more open projects to either replace or supplement Nupedia. It seems to me wikis can be implemented practically instantly, need very little maintenance, and in general are very low-risk. They're also a potentially great source for content. So there's little downside, as far as I can determine. Wales set one up and put it online on Wednesday 10 January 2001.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} proved indeed," [...] Caretto said, when Gervaise {{finished}} his story, [...] "that you {{are worthy of}} the bestowal of a gage by a fair damsel.

5000|$|She {{suggests}} {{making it}} clear that modern culture's disassociation with nature has occurred gradually over time, rather than very recently. Dickinson <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> people idealize their own childhoods without seeing the dysfunction that has existed for multiple generations. She warns against viewing the cure to nature deficit disorder as an outward entity: [...] "nature". Instead, Dickinson states that a path of inward self-assessment [...] "with nature" [...] (rather than [...] "in nature") and alongside meaningful time spent in nature is the key to solving the social and environmental problems of which nature deficit disorder is a symptom. In addition, she advocates allowing nature education to take on an emotional pedagogy rather than a mainly scientific one, as well as experiencing nature as it is before ascribing names to everything.|$|R

The wheels of fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time. Let us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of the guillotine.
