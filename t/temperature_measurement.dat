25|$|<b>Temperature</b> <b>measurement</b> was {{initially}} done by Basset using an optical pyrometer {{to measure the}} intensity of the incandescent light from the sample. Colleagues at UC Berkeley were better able to utilize the black body radiation and more accurately measure the temperature. The hot spot produced by the laser also created large thermal gradients in between the portions of sample that were hit by the focused laser and those that were not. The solution to this problem is ongoing but advances have been made with the introduction of a double-sided approach.|$|E

25|$|Measurement of the {{spectrum}} of noise-power produced by an electrical resistor can also provide an accurate <b>temperature</b> <b>measurement.</b> The resistor has two terminals and is in effect a one-dimensional body.

In a given frequency band, the noise-power has equal contributions from every frequency and is called Johnson noise. If the value of the resistance is known then the temperature can be found.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of laser heating began only 8 years after Charles Weir, of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), {{made the first}} diamond anvil cell and Alvin Van Valkenburg, NBS, realized the potential {{of being able to}} see the sample while under pressure. William Bassett and his colleague Taro Takahashi focused a laser beam on the sample while under pressure. The first laser heating system used a single 7 joule pulsed ruby laser that heated the sample to 3000°C while at 260 kilobars. This was sufficient to convert graphite to diamond. The major flaw of in the first system was control and <b>temperature</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Absolute, or thermodynamic, {{temperature}} is conventionally measured in kelvins (Celsius-scaled increments) {{and in the}} Rankine scale (Fahrenheit-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute <b>temperature</b> <b>measurement</b> is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies {{the size of the}} degree, so the ratios of two absolute temperatures, T2/T1, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. It can also be found in Fermi–Dirac statistics (for particles of half-integer spin) and Bose–Einstein statistics (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing exponential functions of energy (at the particle level) over kT, with k representing the Boltzmann constant and T representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of <b>temperature</b> <b>measurement</b> used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
