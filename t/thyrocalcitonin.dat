40|$|During {{the first}} week of life serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, immunoreactive <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> hormone, and {{parathyroid}} hormone concentrations were determined daily in 36 preterm and 29 small for gestational age, full term, healthy infants. Preterm babies with early neonatal hypocalcaemia had significantly higher concentrations of serum <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> hormone in the first four days of life than normocalcaemic preterm babies. Parathyroid hormone concentrations were similar in hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic infants. In contrast, in the full term group no significant differences were detected in <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> hormone and parathyroid hormone patterns between hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic subjects. This suggests two different pathogeneses for early hypocalcaemia in low birthweight infants.

40|$|In pigs, {{the control}} of hypercalcaemia was {{significantly}} impaired by thyroidectomy. Hypercalcaemic perfusion of the pig thyroid (which contains no para-thyroids) in situ produced a systemic hypocalcaemic response which reached its maximum after about 2 hr. perfusion and which persisted {{for as long as}} the hypercalcaemic stimulus was applied. Thyroid venous plasma from a gland so perfused, when cross-transfused into a second pig, caused a hypo-calcaemic reaction similar to that produced by the intravenous injection of porcine <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> preparations. Hypermagnesaemia did not appear to influence the release of thyro-calcitonin. A hypocalcaemic response to hypercalcaemic perfusion of the thyroid, similar to that seen in intact pigs, occurred in parathyroidectomized pigs, provided that the initial plasma calcium level was maintained by suitable calcium supplement to the diet. Hypocalcaemic perfusion of the thyroid, in either intact or parathyroid-ectomized pigs, resulted in a rise in the systemic plasma calcium concen-tration, although this rise was only consistently observed when the systemic plasma calcium level was already low as a result of <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> secretion. It is suggested that the secretion of <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism operating through the plasma calcium con-centration, and that because of the rapidity of its release, action and elimination, relative to parathyroid hormone, <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> acts as a fine regulator of calcium homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Pentagastrin is {{a potent}} {{stimulator}} of <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> secretion from "C" cells. Since medulllary carcinoma of the thyroid gland (MCT) is a tumor composed of "C" cells, pentagastrin was used to screen a large kindred with multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MCT, pheochromocytoma (s), and parathyroid hyperplasia). Four children with no thyroid abnormalities evident on physical examination, with negative thyroid scans, and with normal levels of plasma <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> {{both before and after}} calcium infusion, were found to have elevated peripheral levels of this hormone following pentagastrin injection. All four children were found to have very small foci of MCT, in both thyroid lobes at the time of total thyroidectomy.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dibutyryl cyclic {{adenosine}} 3 ′, 5 ′-monophosphate upon calcium and phosphate metabolism in thyroparathyroidectomized rats was undertaken {{in an effort}} to clarify the possible role of adenosine 3 ′, 5 ′-monophosphate (3 ′, 5 ′ AMP) in parathyroid hormone action. The infusion of dibutyryl cyclic 3 ′, 5 ′ AMP at a rate of 3 mg/hr into thyroparathyroidectomized rats leads to changes in calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline excretion, and calcium and phosphate concentrations in plasma that are qualitatively similar to those induced by parathyroid hormone given at a rate of 5 μg/hr.

40|$|A {{specific}} local {{erosion of}} the medial edges of the pubic bones is induced by administration of estradiol cyclopentylpropionate (ECP) to thyroparathyroidectomized mice. This paper presents both histochemical and biochemical evidence that porcine <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> (TCT) inhibits this estrogen-mediated resorption of the pubic symphysis. A marked increase in osteoclasts with a resultant increase in demonstrable sites of acid phosphatase (AcP) activity was observed in serial sections of resorbing pubic symphyses from ECP-treated animals. Bioassay of excised pubic symphyses revealed a concomitant increase in AcP activity. When mice were treated with TCT in combination with ECP, a marked decrease in osteoclasts with a resultant decrease in demonstrable sites of AcP activity and inhibition of the resorption process occurred.

Care (1965), in young pigs, perfused the thyroid only with high calcium blood and observed a profound fall in the systemic plasma calcium concentration. The explanation for the contrast in the response to stimulation of <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> secretion may lie in a difference in age and also perhaps in the species.

40|$|TO the {{investigator}} {{concerned with the}} fun-damental aspects of endocrine control mecha-nisms and the practical application of such knowledge, regulation of the secretion of the parathyroid and thyroid glands offers much that is both challenging and new, and also lends itself easily to further development.

In a more methodical but no less compel-ling way, evidence of the participation of the central nervous system in the stimulation and inhibition of thyroid hormone secretion makes it clear that there is a more mature and in-clusive control of thyroid secretion than the conventional pituitary feedback mechanism.

40|$|The {{alterations}} in the ultrastructure of rat embryonic thyroid C cells in vitro produced by {{variation in the}} ambient calcium of the medium were studied. The thyroid C cells from 19 -day-old rat fetuses were cultured for 48 hours in calcium concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg%. The C cells show a cyclic change in the ultrastructure. The resting cells have a sparse, dispersed granular endoplasmic reticulum, small Golgi apparatus and numerous secretory granules. The granules are emptied into the extracellular space followed by aggregation of the granular endoplasmic reticulum, enlargement of the Golgi apparatus, and reaccumulation of secretory products in granules. Varying the calcium concentration failed to change the proportion of cells in the various stages of the secretory cycle, though {{the mean number of}} secretory granules per unit area of cytoplasm fell proportionally with increasing ambient calcium concentration (y = - 0. 1675 x + 3. 93). This decrease is largely due to a {{reduction in the number of}} cells with higher densities of secretory granules and corresponds to the direct increase in calcitonin content of the medium. This could indicate that secretion is directly stimulated in cells rich in secretory granules by a high calcium concentration. In contrast, these ultrastructural studies also indicate that, unlike the situation in the parathyroid chief cell, alteration of the ambient calcium concentration has little effect on the rate of synthesis of <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> by thyroid C cells...|$|E

The maximum stimulatory effect of TCT, 44 ± 6. 7 per cent, was always less than the 150 to 250 per cent increase produced by parathyroid hormone (PTH). The effect of both hormones together was no {{greater than that of}} PTH alone when each was present at a maximally effective concentration. Since neither TCT nor PTH altered the rate of degradation of cyclic AMP by the kidney preparation, it may be inferred that their effects on cyclic AMP accumulation are the result of increased formation of cyclic AMP. Adenyl cyclase activity in homogenates of renal cortex was stimulated to a greater extent by TCT and PTH than was that of medulla, whereas, as reported earlier, the effect of vasopressin was much larger with homogenates of medulla. The accumulation of cyclic AMP in incubations of rat kidney cortex slices was increased 20 to 60 per cent by TCT and 50 to 140 per cent by PTH. The accumulation of cyclic AMP in incubations of rat calvaria was increased about threefold with TCT and nine to tenfold with PTH, while reduced and alkylated TCT had less than 10 per cent of the activity of TCT.

40|$|SUMMARY A case {{involving}} a gastric carcinoid in association with parathyroid adenoma is reported {{and the question of}} a possible link between these two ailments is discussed. Case report A 33 year old woman with no previous history was admitted to hospital with a haematemesis. An emergency upper alimentary endoscopy showed an ulcerated submucosal tumour on the greater curve. The patient complained of flushing of the face during the previous months. 5 HIAA concentrations (5 hydroxy-indol-acetic-acid) were three times the normal average concentration, and the serotonin concentration in her urine was twice normal. Plasma gastrin and <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> were normal. A recur-rence of haematemesis prompted an operation, during which a 4 cm protruding tumour was found on the greater curvature, which spurted blood from the pit in its centre. A subtotal gastrectomy was carried out. The liver was macroscopically normal, but a surgical biopsy revealed the presence of a carcinoid tumour. Endoscopic and ultrasound observations done after surgery as well as the 5 HIAA biological concentrations were normal. No serum calcium measurements were taken. Four years later, the patient was again admitted to hospital suffering from right renal colic caused by a stone.

The infusion of 25 HCC in a dosage of 60 U/h to moderately saline-expanded animals (2. 5 % body weight) induced a fall in the excretion {{of all of the}} ions under study after 90 - 120 min similar to that observed in previous experiments from this laboratory. Mean decrements in fractional excretion were: phosphate, 42. 0 % (P < 0. 005); calcium, 25. 0 % (P < 0. 005); sodium, 23. 4 % (P < 0. 001); and potassium, 14. 7 % (P < 0. 005). The superimposition of either porcine or salmon TCT (1 - 100 MRC U/h for 2 h) resulted in no further alterations in electrolyte excretion. However, the infusion of TCT during steady-state saline expansion, before the administration of 25 HCC, obviated the renal transport effects of the vitamin D metabolite. Both in the latter studies, as well as those in which similar doses of TCT were given to hydropenic animals, the hormone itself failed to induce any consistent alteration in electrolyte excretion. Cyclic AMP (50 mg/h) caused an increase in the excretion of phosphate, sodium, and potassium and no change in calcium excretion. Like TCT, the nucleotide blocked the action of 25 HCC on the kidney. Raising the mean level of serum ultrafilterable calcium to 3. 02 ± 0. 25 mEq/liter from 1. 62 ± 0. 17 mEq/liter likewise prevented enhanced ionic reabsorption due to 25 HCC...|$|E

Adenyl cyclase activity, measured in a crude membrane fraction of the mucosa, was found {{at all levels of the}} small intestine with the highest activity per milligram protein in the duodenum. The prostaglandins, when added directly to the assay, increased adenyl cyclase activity; the greatest effect (2 -fold increase) was obtained with PGE 1 (maximal effect at 0. 03 mM) and PGE 2. The prostaglandins also increased short-circuit current (SCC) in isolated guinea pig ileal mucosa, with PGE 1 and PGE 2 again giving the greatest effects. The prior addition of theophylline (10 mM) reduced the subsequent SCC response to PGE 1 and vice versa. It was concluded, therefore, that the SCC response to PGE 1, like the response to theophylline, represented active Cl secretion. CT increased adenyl cyclase activity in guinea pig and rabbit ileal mucosa when preincubated with the mucosa from 1 to 2. 5 hr in vitro or for 2. 5 hr in vivo but not when added directly to the assay. The increments in activity caused by PGE 1 and NaF were the same in CT-treated and control mucosa.

40|$|The role of prostaglandins in {{endocrine}} diarrheagenic syndromes {{was evaluated}} by measuring peripheral concentration of immunoreactive PGE and PGF {{in patients with}} non-endocrine diarrhea {{as well as those}} with the Zollinger-Ellison (Z-E) syndrome, MCT, carcinoid tumors and the WDHA syndrome. In 21 normals, PGE and PGF levels averaged 272 +/- 18 and 119 +/- 14 pg/ml, respectively. Twenty eight patients with diarrhea of non-endocrine origin (mainly inflammatory bowel disease) had levels indistinguishable from normal, i. e. 353 +/- 25 and 77 +/- 37 pg/ml, respectively. Among 29 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (mean gastrin 6127 +/- 3267 pg/ml) only 2 had significantly elevated PGE levels; mean PGE levels, 382 +/- 32 pg/ml, were not significantly different from normal and did not correlate with either diarrhea or the serum gastrin concentration. In contrast, 18 of 22 patients with carcinoid tumors (mean blood serotonin concentration 1655 +/- 604 ng/ml; mean urinary excretion of 5 HIAA 66. 8 +/- 16. 7 mg/day) had elevated peripheral concentrations of PGE. The mean PGE level (1367 +/- 245 pg/ml) was significantly elevated (P less than 0. 001). Nonetheless PGE levels did not correlate with diarrhea, blood concentrations of serotonin, or urinary indole excretion. MCT (mean serum calcitonin 24. 5 +/- 6. 3 ng/ml) was similarly associated with consistent (18 / 19) elevation in peripheral concentrations of PGE (mean 1922 +/- 541 pg/ml; P less than 0. 001). Inthis syndrome, PGE levels were higher in patients with diarrhea and in those with markedly elevated serum <b>thyrocalcitonin</b> levels. Finally, 8 of 21 patients with the WDHA syndrome had increased levels of PGE. Although 13 of 17 patients had high levels of VIP (mean 8133 pg/ml), 2 patients had hyperprostaglandinemia in the face of normal peripheral concentrations of VIP. In one patient the serum PGE level was elevated prior to resection of the primary pancreatic neoplasm (9939 pg/ml) as well as the subsequent extirpation of a solitary hepatic metastasis (1063 pg/ml); following each procedure the diarrhea abated and the PGE level returned to normal. In none of these syndromes were mean PGF levels elevated. The study has documented hyperprostaglandinemia in some endocrine diarrheagenic syndromes and validated the usefullness of measurements of PGE in patients with unexplained diarrhea...|$|E
