5|$|Berry dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from March 1989 to October 1991. In November 1993, Ronan sued Berry for $80,000 in what {{he claimed}} were unpaid loans to help launch her career. Berry contended that the money was a gift, and a judge {{dismissed}} <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> Ronan did not list Berry as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992. According to Berry, a beating from a former abusive boyfriend during the filming of The Last Boy Scout punctured her eardrum and caused her to lose eighty percent of her hearing in her left ear. Berry has never named the abuser but {{has said that he}} is someone well known in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Loughner {{was held}} in the Federal Correctional Institution at Phoenix without bail. All Arizona-based federal judges recused {{themselves}} from <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> of their ties to Judge Roll, who was killed in the attack. The federal case was assigned to a San Diego-based jurist, federal Judge Larry Alan Burns from the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The public defender Judy Clarke, also based in San Diego, was appointed to represent Loughner in federal court.|$|E
5|$|Yates has {{cautioned that}} P. {{gracilis}} {{may be a}} metataxon, which {{means that there is}} neither evidence that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), nor that it is paraphyletic (belongs to several species). This is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> the holotype of P.(Sellosaurus) gracilis has no skull, and the other specimens consist of skulls and material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it certain that it belongs to the same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to Plateosaurus.|$|E

5|$|When the {{legislature}} convened on February 19, {{two sets of}} officers attempted to preside. Marshall and Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, both claimed the right to preside over the state senate. Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate; Beckham counter-sued for possession of the capitol and executive building. The cases were consolidated, and both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the courts decide the election. On March 10, a circuit court found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats. By a 6–1 vote, the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort at the time, upheld the circuit court's decision on April 6, legally unseating Taylor and Marshall. The case of Taylor v. Beckham was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the court refused to intervene in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> it {{found that there were}} no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court {{will hear the}} case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped to decide <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E

40|$|Acute Bacterial Parotitis (ABP) is an {{infection}} seen in very early and old ages. The infection {{can be prevented}} by sufficient fluid support, mouth hygiene, oral feeding and avoiding multiple medication use. Parotis ultrasonography {{can be used for}} diagnosis. Acute Bacterial Parotitis can be treated in a short time and free of problems with early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotics. Mortality can be seen in cases which are late diagnosed and which are resistant to antibiotic treatment. This article presents four <b>case</b> reports over <b>the</b> age of 65 with a diagnosis of ABP, who are monitored in the intensive care. It is thought that <b>the</b> first <b>case</b> developed ABP <b>because</b> of multiple medication use, liquid restriction and oral feeding difficulty, <b>the</b> second <b>case</b> <b>because</b> of oral feeding difficulty, <b>the</b> third <b>case</b> <b>because</b> of bad mouth hygiene, dementia and not getting enough liquid and <b>the</b> fourth <b>case</b> <b>because</b> of oral feeding difficulty.
