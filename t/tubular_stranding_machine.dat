50|$|A draeden's rarely-seen true {{appearance}} is {{a cluster of}} about forty <b>tubular</b> <b>strands,</b> all symmetrically attached at a central node. Each strand has a mouth at its end, and opens upon a digestive passage {{that leads to the}} central node. The node is spherical and ridged, resembling a human brain, and is the creature's equivalent of a stomach. It contains several boulders to aid digestion. A draeden's nervous system spans its entire body. The creatures's total length varies from 19 to 38 miles, tip to tip. The central node usually comprises one-tenth of the creature's total diameter. Draeden usually appear to other creatures as the most deadly thing imaginable to those creatures.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design a {{constant}} tension braking device for Fort Wayne Metals. The device is to be implemented in a Bartell B- 62 <b>tubular</b> <b>strander.</b> The constant torque braking device currently being used was redesigned {{in an effort to}} allow adjustment of the braking torque during strander operation. The intent of this adjustment is to provide more consistent tension as the wire pays off the spool at differing radial distances. The final design adequately meets the requirements of Fort Wayne Metals. The conceptual braking design was proven to provide much more consistent wire tension than its predecessor, is adjustable during strander operation, provides braking torque without dry friction, fits in the barrel of the strander, and costs less than $ 10, 000. 00...|$|R

40|$|Young corn (Zea mays L) {{ears are}} small, {{immature}} indehiscent fruits {{that do not}} open spontaneously at maturity to release seeds. The present ultra structural {{study was conducted to}} examine detailed surface structure topography of the young corn ear. Macroscopic observation was done on fresh young corn ears prior to dry-gross sectioning. They were viewed using variable pressure scanning electron microscope (VPSEM). Observation of the longitudinal and horizontal section shows manifestation of anomalous appearances of the pedicel of the cotyledon. The actual area of growth of the corn silk base mimics the structured formation of matured corn fruit were seen in all micrographs. The ultra structures of the young corn ears consist of the pith cell, pedicel, corn silk roots and pericarp of the cotyledon. Corn silks also present as a single hollow <b>tubular</b> <b>strand</b> with longitudinally-oriented array tubes at every pedicel. The size of these corn silks strands vary between 6 - 8 μm in diameter. These findings are the first recording describing the VPSEM analysis of the surface ultra structure topography of young corn ears...|$|R

40|$|Fibrous {{phosphorus}} {{is one of}} {{the known}} crystalline allotropes under standard pressure conditions. It has been predicted prior to its successful synthesis and structural characterization. The allotrope consists of parallel, <b>tubular</b> double <b>strands</b> of phosphorus, in contrast to the violet form of Hittorf's phosphorus, where the same strands are arranged in a perpendicular orientation towards each other. This structural similarity results in an almost identical energetic stability leading to a somehow problematic realization of single-phase materials. We herein report on the successful synthesis route to single phase fibrous phosphorus and the in situ characterization of its formation via the gas phase applying CuCl 2 as a mineralizer. The sublimation pressure of fibrous phosphorus is slightly lower than the one of the black allotrope. This behavior indicates thermodynamic stability of fibrous phosphorus...|$|R

50|$|While rope may be {{made from}} three or more strands, modern braided rope {{consists}} of a braided (<b>tubular)</b> jacket over <b>strands</b> of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for rappelling or to suspend an arborist. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used {{as a part of}} a personal or group safety system.|$|R
40|$|During {{maturation}} of the {{red blood}} cell (RBC) from the nucleated normoblast stage to the mature biconcave discocyte, both the structure and mechanical proper-ties of the cell undergo radical changes. The development of the mechanical stabil-ity of the membrane reflects underlying changes {{in the organization of}} membrane-associated cytoskeletal proteins, and so provides an assessment of the time course of the development of membrane structural organization. Membrane stabil-ity in maturing erythrocytes was as-sessed by measuring forces required to form thin, <b>tubular,</b> lipid <b>strands</b> (tethers) from the surfaces of mononuclear cells obtained from fresh human marrow samples, marrow reticulocytes, circulat-ing reticulocytes, and mature erythro-cytes. Cells were biotinylated and manipu-lated with a micropipette to form an adhesive contact with a glass microcanti-lever, which gave a measure of the tether-ing force. The cell was withdrawn at con-trolled velocity and aspiration pressure to form a tether from the cell surface. The mean force required to form tethers from marrow reticulocytes and normoblasts was 27 6 9 pN, compared to 54 6 14 pN for mature cells. The energy of dissociation of the bilayer from the underlying skeleton increases 4 -fold between the marrow reticu-locytestageandthematurecell, demonstrat-ing that the mechanical stability of the mem-brane is not completely established until the very last stages of RBC maturation.

40|$|Although {{quantitative}} analysis of metal alloys is typically accomplished by wet-chemical techniques, complete dissolution of some metal alloys can be difficult. Here, we report an alternative non-destructive energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) method for determination of nickel, gold, copper, and silver in metal alloy wires. Sample preparation {{is simple and}} consists of mounting wires as a single <b>strand</b> in <b>machined</b> polyethylene sample cups. Wires are analyzed in two symmetrical positions nearly parallel to the x-ray beam, thereby improving the external reproducibility of the analysis. Ideally, standards and samples are matched in terms of chemical composition and diameter. For 50 mil copper-silver wire, four certified reference wires consisting of various copper-silver compositions and matching the unknown diameter were used. However, we also investigated standards of different elemental composition and thickness. For analysis of 25 mil nickel-gold wires, 20 mil NIST standard wires consisting of copper-gold were applied for standardization and compared with certified 25 mil nickel-gold standards. Variations in wire diameter were corrected using an infinite thickness approximation, and nickel intensities were calculated from the copper intensities using...|$|R
40|$|Problems in {{continuous}} {{casting of steel}} are numerous and have been leading producers to find ever more efficient solutions. Wa have developed a thermomechanical model of continuous casting, using a non-linear finite element code. Since a complete 3 D discretization seemed impossible, the model {{has been based on}} a generalized plane strain state (2 D 1 / 2) and it includes at the same time thermal exchanges, mechanical behaviour of steel at very high temperature, the ferrostatic pressure and contact between the <b>strand</b> and the <b>machine.</b> This paper presents some results of two industrial applications. First results tend to prove the importance of some process factors (such as the mould taper) and local defects of the machine on the quality of cast products, according with observations.

50|$|Two or more wires may {{be wrapped}} concentrically, {{separated}} by insulation, to form coaxial cable. The wire or cable may be further protected with substances like paraffin, {{some kind of}} preservative compound, bitumen, lead, aluminum sheathing, or steel taping. <b>Stranding</b> or covering <b>machines</b> wind material onto wire which passes through quickly. Some of the smallest machines for cotton covering have a large drum, which grips the wire and moves it through toothed gears; the wire passes through the centre of disks mounted above a long bed, and the disks carry each a number of bobbins varying from six to twelve or more in different machines. A supply of covering material is wound on each bobbin, and the end is led on to the wire, which occupies a central position relatively to the bobbins; the latter being revolved at a suitable speed bodily with their disks, the cotton is consequently served on to the wire, winding in spiral fashion so as to overlap. If {{a large number of}} strands are required the disks are duplicated, so that as many as sixty spools may be carried, the second set of strands being laid over the first.|$|R
40|$|What {{is machine}} {{learning}}? Machine {{learning is a}} type of statistics that places particular emphasis on the use of advanced computational algorithms. As computers become more powerful, and modern experimental methods in areas such as imaging generate vast bodies of data, machine learning is becoming ever more important for extracting reliable and meaningful relationships and for making accurate predictions. Key <b>strands</b> of modern <b>machine</b> learning grew out of attempts to understand how large numbers of interconnected, more or less neuron-like elements could learn to achieve behaviourally meaningful computations and to extract useful features from images or sound waves. By the 1990 s, key approaches had converged on an elegant framework called ‘graphical models’, explained in Koller and Friedman, in which the nodes of a graph represent variables such as edges and corners in an image, or phonemes and words in speech. The probabilistic relationships between nodes are represented by conditional probability tables or simple functions whose parameters are learned from the data. There are three main problems in fitting graphical models to data: inference, parameter learning and structure learning. The inference problem is how to infer the probable values of unobserved variables when the values of a subset of the variables have been observed, and is a problem that perceptual systems need to solve if they are to infer the hidden causes of their sensory input. The parameter-learning problem is how to adjust the parameters governing the way in which one variable influences another, so that the graphical model is a better fit to some observed data. In the brain, this is presumably done by changing synapse strengths. The structure-learning problem is how to decide which unobserved variables are needed and how they must be connected to model the correlations between observed variables. In the brain, evolution and early pruning of connections presumably have a large role to play in determining the structure...|$|R
