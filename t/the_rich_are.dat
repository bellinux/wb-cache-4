500|$|Several reviewers have {{commented on}} {{themes of the}} episode; topics of {{discussion}} included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene {{in relation to the}} overall moral of the series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that [...] "the two aren't so different after all." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: [...] "it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] "cement the dour reality, posited {{at the very beginning of}} the series, that <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> ... <b>are</b> always going to be the ones in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the great}} trilogy, Clement's only other extant {{work is the}} {{treatise}} Salvation for the Rich, also known as Who is the Rich Man who is Saved? Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes towards the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of [...] <b>The</b> <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> either unconvinced {{by the promise of}} eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them towards a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally — we should seek the supercelestial [...] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, {{as long as it is}} used charitably, but men should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich man is to be saved, all he must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor.|$|E

500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. <b>The</b> <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E

The number of the community members fluctuated, through the following years.

It is not merely that the slaves are thieves and runaways, wine-bibbers and gluttons - <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>are</b> worse (iv. 3).

Everywhere the taxes are heaped upon the needy, while the rich, who have the apportioning of the impost, escape comparatively free (v. 7).

60|$|Labour is {{required}} for physical, and leisure for moral improvement: from the former of these advantages the rich, and from the latter the poor, by the inevitable conditions of their respective situations, are precluded. A state which should combine the advantages of both would be subjected to the evils of neither.
