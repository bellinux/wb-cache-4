5|$|Taborn prefers earlier {{models of}} Fender Rhodes, for their raunchier sound. He also {{attempts}} to retain control over <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> {{is presented to}} an audience when playing electronic instruments: he links his instruments to his own amplifier, and then has the venue take its feed from that amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss. Cochlear implants transmit <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Once the P. rebeli larvae {{infiltrate}} the host’s brood, they ascend {{to the highest}} social ranks of the host's hierarchy by using acoustics to achieve social acceptance from worker M. schencki ants. P. rebeli larvae and pupa accomplish this by mimicking <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> {{the queen of the}} ant colony makes, both while as a larva and as a pupa in the colony.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band to retain <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket continues the pop punk sound {{that the group}} honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E

50|$|According to McKenzie {{the movie}} ran {{for three weeks}} in a Melbourne cinema, got reviews and didn't make any money: I've got mixed {{feelings}} about that film. I think probably my biggest disappointment with {{it is that we}} never had any money to do a soundtrack properly. That particular film should live on the soundtrack. It's all about <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> you hear, <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> you replay, <b>the</b> various <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> represent <b>the</b> different parties in the flats and how they impinge on the lead character's life. It never worked particularly well. We never really had the time or the resources to do it.|$|R

25|$|On Friday 21 July 1978, Brady {{launched}} his album Welcome Here Kind Stranger with {{a concert in}} the auditorium of Liberty Hall in Dublin.

25|$|A solid body {{electric}} guitar, {{made up of}} hardwood with a lacquer coating, is {{an electric}} guitar that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. <b>The</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an amplifier or a speaker. The solid body guitar was invented in 1941 by American recording artist Les Paul.|$|E
25|$|Their split LP with Void As well {{as their}} more catchy but still raging EP Subject to Change. Known for their inward-looking lyrics—a {{pioneering}} thing in a scene more given to social and political themes—and the gruff allure of Alec MacKaye's vocals, The Faith was highly esteemed by local punk fans. They have probably made a deeper impact on the underground. They created <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> went on to shape much of what came after, especially later period D.C. bands. The Faith shows why hardcore has lasting power, how even music recognised mainly for its brevity and brutality can convey something emotional and immediate, even several years on.|$|E
25|$|Upon its release, Killer Love {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} response from music critics. Some praised Scherzinger's strong vocals and conviction to convey emotion, while others criticized {{her choice of}} allowing RedOne to produce {{the majority of the}} album, stating that some of the songs sounded too similar to each other. At times it was felt that Scherzinger lacked coherence across the record, often taking <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> individual producers had created for her instead of showing originality. Critics compared many of the songs to those her fellow pop and R contemporaries Beyoncé and Rihanna. Scherzinger recorded new songs with R. Kelly, Snoop Dogg and Ne-Yo for the North American release of Killer Love; however, she confirmed that recording for her second studio album, originally scheduled for late 2013 release, had begun, signalling the end of the promotion for Killer Love.|$|E

5000|$|Senada's [...] "Theory of Phonetic Organization" [...] states, [...] "the {{musician}} {{should put}} <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> first, building <b>the</b> music up from {{them rather than}} developing the music, then working down to <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> make it up." ...|$|R
25|$|This period {{also saw}} {{significant}} advances in digital audio technology. Space Invaders in 1978 {{was the first}} game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple chromatic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and changed pace during stages. Rally-X in 1980 was the first game to feature continuous background music, which was generated using a dedicated sound chip, a Namco 3-channel PSG. That same year saw the introduction of speech synthesis, which was first used in Stratovox, released by Sun Electronics in 1980, followed soon after by Namco's King & Balloon, which was an early example of multiple CPUs, using two Z80 microprocessors, the second to drive a DAC for speech. Multi-CPUs were used by several arcade games the following year, including Frogger, which used two Z80 microprocessors and an AY-3-8910 PSG sound chip, and Scramble, which used two Z80 microprocessors and two AY-3-8910 sound chips. In 1983, Gyruss, known for its stereo sound and musical score, utilized multi CPUs, which included two Z80 microprocessors, one 6809 microprocessor, and one 8039 microprocessor, along with five AY-3-8910 sound chips and a DAC for <b>the</b> <b>sound.</b> <b>That</b> same year, the Namco Pole Position system used two Z8002 microprocessors and one Z80 microprocessor, along with a Namco 6-channel stereo PSG sound chip for the sound.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of a schwa, the author must write <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> would be used if the word was stressed. For example, the word enough is {{commonly}} pronounced , but when it is stressed (as in a declaration of irritation) it is pronounced [...] The Deseret spelling of the word, 𐐨𐑌𐐲𐑁, reflects that stressed pronunciation.

500|$|In another interview, Kramer later gave great {{credit to}} Page for <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> was achieved, despite the {{inconsistent}} {{conditions in which}} it was recorded: [...] "We did that album piece-meal. We cut some of the tracks {{in some of the most}} bizarre studios you can imagine, little holes in the wall. Cheap studios. But in the end it sounded bloody marvellous. There was a unification of sound on [...] Zeppelin II because there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page." [...] Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A Studios.|$|E
50|$|Green and Gold is the band's first {{recorded}} CD. It {{was recorded in}} 2007 for RDTC's 50th birthday and includes <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band has provided for fifty years.|$|R

500|$|Bands {{anticipating the}} {{forthcoming}} movement were appearing as far afield as Düsseldorf, West Germany, where [...] "punk before punk" [...] band NEU! formed in 1971, {{building on the}} Krautrock tradition of groups such as Can. In Japan, the anti-establishment Zunō Keisatsu (Brain Police) mixed garage-psych and folk. The combo regularly faced censorship challenges, their live act at least once including onstage masturbation. A new generation of Australian garage rock bands, inspired mainly by the Stooges and MC5, was coming even closer to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> would soon be called [...] "punk": In Brisbane, the Saints also recalled the raw live sound of the British Pretty Things, who had made a notorious tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1975.|$|E
500|$|The Hungry Saw {{contains}} twelve tracks {{with a total}} {{running time}} of forty-six minutes. Critics noted that the music on the album was a continuation of <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> Tindersticks had been exploring since 1999's soul-influenced Simple Pleasure, with PopMatters stating that [...] "the revamped band sound(s) much like it has since 1999, when they gave up on grandiosity...the paired-down sound of The Hungry Saw is really nothing new." [...] Reviews for The Hungry Saw described the album as containing [...] "foreboding, compelling soul", and [...] "blue-eyed/black-lung balladry with classic soul touches-- warm Hammond organ tones, tambourine-rattled rhythms, female back-up singers" [...] that were [...] "remarkably in tune with contemporary British pop music's neo-soul slant".|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute. Waters said [...] "it {{is hard to}} overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s" [...] and was happy that they had managed to reunite for Live 8. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under-rated, and that his playing [...] "was <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> knitted it all together", comparing his [...] "quiet one" [...] status in the band to George Harrison. Gilmour called him [...] "my musical partner and my friend", praised {{the ability of the}} two men's voices to blend, such as on [...] "Echoes". Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re-iterating that {{it would be wrong to}} resume touring without him.|$|E
