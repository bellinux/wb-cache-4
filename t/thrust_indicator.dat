This fold system is composed by at least three N W vergent asymmetric folds, with axes striking NOSOEand plunging 30 °- 50 ° to the SW.

50|$|That failure caused {{those two}} left-side engines to {{generate}} forward thrust, while the right-side engines generated reverse thrust. The plane {{immediately began to}} veer to the right, {{as a result of}} that asymmetrical thrust. All the tires blew out on the right main gear, after the plane left the runway and hit a new taxiway, still under construction. The nose gear collapsed, and the fuel tank on the right wing was ruptured, starting the fatal fire.

40|$|Thrusting at shallow depths often precludes {{analysis}} {{by means of}} structural indicators effective in other geological contexts (e. g., mylonites, sheath folds, shear bands). In this paper, a combination of techniques (including structural analysis, magnetic methods, as anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility and paleomagnetism, and paleothermometry) is used to define thrusting conditions, deformation, and transport directions in the Cameros–Demanda thrust (North Spain). Three outcrops were analyzed along this intraplate, large-scale major structure having 150  km of outcropping length, 30  km of maximum horizontal displacement, and 5  km of vertical throw. Results obtained {{by means of the}} different techniques are compared with data derived from cross sections and stratigraphic analysis. Mixed-layer illite–smectite and vitrinite reflectance indicating deep diagenetic conditions and mature stage of hydrocarbon generation suggests shallow depths during deformation, thus confirming that the protolith for most of the fault rocks is the footwall of the main <b>thrust.</b> Kinematic <b>indicators</b> (foliation, S/C structures, and slickenside striations) indicate altogether a dominant NNW movement of the hanging wall in the western zone and NE in the eastern zone of the thrust, thus implying strain partitioning between different branches of the main thrust. The study of AMS in fault rocks (nearly 400 samples of fault gouge, breccia, and microbreccia) indicates that the strike of magnetic foliation is oblique to the transport direction and that the magnetic lineation parallelizes the projection of the transport direction onto the kmax/kint plane in sites with strong shear deformation. Paleomagnetism applied to fault rocks indicates the existence of remagnetizations linked to thrusting, in spite of the shallow depth for deformation, and a strong deformation or scattering of the magnetic remanence vectors in the fault zone. The application of the described techniques and consistency of results indicate that the proposed multidisciplinary approach is useful when dealing with thrusts at shallow crustal levels...|$|R
40|$|In the {{southern}} Apennines fold and <b>thrust</b> belt, thermal <b>indicators</b> record exhumation of sedimentary units from depths locally {{in excess of}} 5 km. The belt is made of allochthonous sedimentary units that overly a 6 8 km thick, carbonate footwall succession. The latter is deformed by reverse faults involving the underlying basement. Therefore, a switch from thin-skinned to thick-skinned thrusting occurred as the Apulian Platform carbonates - and the underlying continental lithosphere - were deformed during the latest shortening stages. Apatite fission track data, with cooling ages ranging between 9. 2 ± 1. 0 and 1. 5 ± 0. 8 Ma, indicate that exhumation marks these late tectonic stages, probably initiating with the buttressing of the allochthonous wedge against the western margin of the Apulian Platform. Pliocene-Pleistocene foreland advancing of the allochthonous units exceeds {{the total amount of}} slip that could be transferred {{to the base of the}} allochthon from the underlying thick-skinned structures. This suggests that emplacement of the allochthon above the western portion of the Apulian Platform carbonates was followed by gravitational readjustments within the allochthonous wedge, coeval - and partly associated with - thick-skinned shortening at depth. The related denudation processes have played a primary role in tectonic exhumation...|$|R
40|$|The main <b>thrust</b> for {{sustainability}} <b>indicators</b> {{for renewable}} natural resource management, in agriculture and rural development in particular, has {{its origins in}} the sustainable development paradigm. Despite tremendous progress in the science surrounding climate change scenarios, it is not currently possible to rely upon existing scenarios for Sudan to confidently {{assess the impact of}} climate change on vulnerable communities. The broad objective of the research is to explore the potential role of the sustainable livelihood assets of household under prevailing climate change and desert encroachment, thus enabling them to adapt. This study was conducted at Umjawasir in southern part of Marawi province. Two types of data were used in this research, namely; primary and secondary data. The primary data was collected through personal interviews with individual using structured questionnaire, group discussions and observation. The main findings of the research are; sources of income are limited. Most of the small farmers rely on subsistence and cash crops which are barely sufficient, and animal breeding is the second source of income. At the end of the harvest season there is no surplus money to save for the next season. The study area is suffering from desert encroachment and a long-term climatic change. Decrease in rainfall, in combination with the interaction of man and animals, are the main reasons for the gradual desertification of the study area. The principal source of labor is the hired labor beside the household (family labor) also contributes to the labor force. Still the community members retain big herds and the bigger the herd the greater prestige value for the owner. Despite the frequent severe drought, the rangelands deterioration and overstocking, there are no conflicts between the different Hawawir clans. The main conclusions of the research are; the efforts exerted by ADRA project contributed significantly to the sustainable livelihood of the local people, the study area witnesses’ cute climate variability and climate change which affects water resources in the study area, the sources of income for the local community is limited. The level of participation of local community in the activities of the project is good and this reflects the potentiality of the project in mobilizing the local community for the adoption of the different activities. Also, the study arrived to valuable recommendations...|$|R
