25|$|Philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a {{view that}} is {{considered}} anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever will not go away.

25|$|Recently, a {{consensus}} has been emerging among {{proponents of the}} Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian). The American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and {{more closely related to}} each other than <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Sergei Starostin's school has now re-included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic, while reserving the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Dravidian and Kartvelian.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of a clerestory, the vault is {{comparatively}} low, being only about half the height of that at Westminster Abbey. The interior of the cathedral appears wide and spacious. The architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner wrote of the early 14th-century choir of Bristol that [...] "from {{the point of view of}} spatial imagination" [...] it is not only superior <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in England or Europe but [...] "proves incontrovertibly that English design surpasses that of all other countries" [...] at that date.|$|E

The team used [...] "more than 100 video cards" [...] throughout development. Deus Ex was built using Visual Studio, Lightwave, and Lotus Notes. They also built a custom dialogue editor, ConEdit. The team used UnrealEd atop the Unreal game engine for map design, which Spector wrote was [...] "superior <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> available". Their trust in UnrealScript {{led them to}} code [...] "special-cases" [...] for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi-case code.

500|$|The Final Symphony II concerts have {{received}} rave reviews from critics, who {{viewed it as}} a high-quality extension of the original Final Symphony concert series rather than a completely unique orchestral experience. A review of the premier concert in Bonn by Markus Roth of Video Game Music Online claimed that [...] "the Final Symphony series is a masterclass concert series, which easily lends itself to musical discussion and interpretation of the highest standards", and that the second concert series was the equal to the original. Joe Hammond of Video Game Music Online, {{in a review of}} the London performance, said that Final Symphony II [...] "wasn't reinventing the wheel or revolutionising what the team have already done, it was triumphantly expanding on previous success". He felt that the concert series was [...] "lighter and more accessible" [...] than the original due to its use of fewer and less complicated types of orchestral arrangements, and that Merregnon Studios did not [...] "try to push the boundaries" [...] but instead tried to [...] "expand on the success of the Final Symphony 1 programme with other games in the series", in his opinion successfully. Stephen Little of Cubed Gamers, reviewing the same concert, termed it [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "a pleasure to watch, listen and be involved in", while John Son of Cubed3 said that the concert was [...] "one of the best performances of video game music to have ever been showcased". A review of the Tampere concert by Nikolas Broman of Original Sound Version—his fifth Final Symphony II performance attendance—agreed with Hammond, stating that while he felt the original series was better, as it had more interesting arrangement styles and a more even quality, that audiences seemed to prefer the second series as [...] "the arrangements were safer, the melodies closer to the originals, and overall it was perhaps easier to follow". He felt that the Final Fantasy IX section was the best, with the Final Fantasy XIII section as the weakest as [...] "good... but nothing special". Regardless, he claimed that he could only compare Final Symphony II to the original series [...] "because it doesn't make sense to compare it <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> It is leaps and bounds above any other major game music concert series".|$|E

2500|$|Wilson states that, {{while there}} is no unifying theme or concept behind the album, [...] "There are at least four or five songs on that record which I call the divorce songs, the {{relationship}} songs, which are all about various stages of the splitting up a relationship, of dissolving a relationship. Russia On Ice, How Is Your Life Today, Shesmovedon, Feel So Low, I mean, the last track of the album. The period in a relationship, where the relationship is kind of... still exists, but it's in that period where, really, there is nothing left but hatred and despise - Hatesong is the other one. But then on the other hand, there are groups of songs on the album which are all about various childhood... nostalgic childhood reminisces, Lightbulb Sun and the first part of Last Chance To Evacuate Planet Earth, Where We Would Be.

2500|$|Central to al-Kindi's {{understanding}} of metaphysics is God's absolute oneness, which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God (and therefore not shared with anything else). By this he means {{that while we}} may think of any existent thing as being [...] "one", {{it is in fact}} both [...] "one" [...] and many". For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say [...] "I see an elephant", by which he means [...] "I see one elephant", but the term 'elephant' refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever. Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> cannot be said about God.|$|E
