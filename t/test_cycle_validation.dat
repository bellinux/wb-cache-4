To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled Rockwell hardness testing machines. The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of test force, application velocity of test force, and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R

Needless to say, businesses need to rely on their machine park to function as planned, avoiding stops in production due to machine failures. This is where fault detection methods play a very important part. In this thesis a specific fault detection method based on signal analysis will be considered. When testing a robot for fault(s), a specific <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> (trajectory) is executed {{in order to be able}} to compare test data from different test occasions. Furthermore, different <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> yield different measurements to analyse, which may affect the performance of the analysis. The question posed is: Can we find an optimal <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> so that the fault is best revealed in the test data? The goal of this thesis is to, using regression analysis, investigate how the presently executed <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> in a specific diagnosis method relates to the faults that are monitored (in this case a so called friction fault) and decide if a different one should be recommended. The data also includes representations of two disturbances. The results from the regression show that the variation in the test quantities utilised in the diagnosis method are not explained by neither the friction fault or the <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> It showed that the disturbances had too large effect on the test quantities. This made it impossible to recommend a different (optimal) <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> based on the analysis...|$|R

The <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> is intended to provide an in-laboratory verification capability to determine if an engine exceeds the in-use emissions standards. By simulating the real-world driving pattern of the vehicle the <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> provide the most realistic estimation of emission levels in the NTE zone of operation. It is well recognized that traditional laboratory <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> do not provide an accurate representation of a vehicle’s operation on the road under present-day driving conditions.

40|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} provide versatility to {{the railway}} system {{as they do}} not depend on electric feeding. Worldwide they constitute important parts of locomotive fleets used for various tasks such as mainline services, shunting and terminal operations. The main drawbacks are emissions of CO 2, NOx and other pollutants. The emissions to air are in general controlled by legislation. The European testing and approval procedure for locomotive engines is performed with the ISO 8178 -F <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> It is alone meant to resemble all European locomotives. Good correlation was found between mainline operations and the ISO 8178 -F <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> A good correlation was furthermore found between shunting operations and North American shunting <b>test</b> <b>cycles.</b> However, this thesis has shown that this results in inadequate description of for instance shunting operations. Typical characteristics for shunting are relatively high ratio of transient loading, low mean power output and high amount of idling. Therefore important aspects of diesel locomotive usage are thereby disregarded in certifications. Deficient correlation between <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> and intended operations may lead to locomotives that are not properly optimised {{for the type of}} operation they are intended for. Improperly dimensioned and optimised locomotives cause impaired fuel economy and more emissions emitted. Many Swedish diesel locomotives are to a large extent used in shunting-like conditions in yards and industries for instance. Therefore, it is recommended to supplement the present ISO <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> with a <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> that includes the characteristic of shunting. Knowledge about duty cycles for specific operations can be of importance in locomotive acquisition, dimensioning of new locomotives or when estimating emissions and/or fuel consumption. It is essential to make proper dimensioning of propulsion systems as it can imply lower life cycle costs as well as fewer emissions. Appropriate dimensioning of the propulsion system is particularly important for non-conventional propulsion systems. If the application range of a <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> is narrow, its emulating capability ought to be better at describing and representing the indented application. Today's <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> state fractional power or torque as a function of engine speed. This may result in misleading duty cycles when the same kind of operation is undertaken with different locomotives that have widespread power ratings. A more powerful locomotive used for the very same load as a less powerful locomotive will result in a different duty cycle. Non-conventional propulsion systems are gaining popularity also in the railway industry where implementation of new technology usually is slow. Dual mode and hybrid systems are two examples. Related to <b>test</b> and duty <b>cycles</b> the build-up of these new propulsion systems change the prerequisites of the propulsion systems. From a duty cycle perspective it is reasonable to implement an additional <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> for non-conventional propulsion systems if the popularity rises. QC 2011111...|$|R
