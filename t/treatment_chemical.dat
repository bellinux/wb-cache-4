25|$|Drift (or windage) is {{the term}} for water {{droplets}} of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge. Drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001–0.005% of the circulating flow rate. A typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for Legionella or water <b>treatment</b> <b>chemical</b> exposure.|$|E
25|$|Machinability can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat <b>treatment,</b> <b>chemical</b> composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.|$|E

5000|$|Cation {{conductivity}} is conductivity measurement {{after the}} Cation Column. At the Cation Column, the H+ resins replace the positive ions of all dissolved {{matter in the}} solution. When this happens, the <b>treatment</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which are desired ones (and are of basic or alkaline in nature) get converted to H2O, i.e. water. (e.g. NH4OH + H(+) gives NH4+ and H2O). The impurities are nothing but salts of different natures These get converted to respective acids (e.g. NaCl + H(+) gives HCl and CL-). Thus masking effects of <b>treatment</b> <b>chemicals</b> on the conductivity value are eliminated, while the conversion of salts to corresponding acids has an effect of increase in their corresponding conductivity value to around 3 times its original value. Thus, in effect, cation conductivity acts as amplifier of conductivity due to impurities and eliminator of conductivity due to <b>treatment</b> <b>chemicals.</b>|$|R

Process synthesis is used to design processes {{that can be used in}} commercial chemical plants. The significance is it uses computer algorithms to determine the chemical processes, reducing the costly need to test chemicals in full-scale production. Rudd's strategies have been used in areas such as waste <b>treatment,</b> <b>chemical</b> production and food processing. University of California Provost C.
