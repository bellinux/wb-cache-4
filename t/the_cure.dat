40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>curing</b> {{behaviour}} of an epoxy/nmSiO 2 nanocomposites system {{composed of}} a bifunctional epoxy resin with an anhydride curing agent and nmSiO 2 was investigated.

40|$|Ageing {{studies on}} {{composite}} rocket propellants (CRP), {{which are based}} on HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) binder systems, are often affected by the post-curing reaction. To obtain satisfying mechanical properties, the so called equivalent ratio NCO/OH for <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> reaction is set normally to values lower than 1. This means, there are more hydroxyl groups available from the binder (HTPB) than isocyanate groups from <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> agent are present in the mix. Nevertheless a complete conversion of the isocyanate groups during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> reaction is hindered by the reduction of the mobility or in other words the increasing viscosity due to <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> progress. <b>The</b> knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> reaction kinetics is important for ageing studies, for the assumptions of the stress-free temperature value and not at least for assessing the post-curing reaction. The value of stress-free temperature is also influenced by ageing effects. Post-curing increases the cross-link density at storage temperature, resulting in a new network part, which overlays and counteracts to the one of the main network formed at curing temperature. This effect should be minimized and the investigation of the time-temperature behavior of <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> reaction is used to determine optimal curing times. In order to separate the influence of filler particles on <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> reaction and to get basic information about the reaction, several formulations have been used: binder formulations with and without plasticizer as well as with and without <b>curing</b> catalyst, besides <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> of complete propellant formulations. <b>The</b> <b>curing</b> processes were followed by heat flow microcalorimetry using the heat of reaction as indicator and by pressure measurements with pressure-temperature transducers in closed pressure cells using the volume shrinkage of <b>the</b> material during <b>curing</b> as indicator...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>curing</b> {{process of}} {{prosthetic}} socket base materials requires attention owing {{to a series}} of associated problems that are yet to be addressed and solved. However, to date, few relevant studies have been reported. In this paper, nanodiamonds modified with a silane coupling agent were dispersed into a prosthetic socket base material, and the performance of the modified base materials was investigated. Adding a predetermined amount of nanodiamonds to the prosthetic socket base material increased the glass transition temperature, improved the mechanical properties of <b>the</b> <b>cured</b> base material, and reduced the influence of the volatile gas formed during <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process on <b>the</b> environment. With increasing nanodiamond contents, the glass transition temperature increased and the mechanical properties improved slightly. Owing to the high thermal conductivity of the nanodiamonds, the localized heat, as a result of <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process, could be dissipated and released. Thus, adding nanodiamonds led to a more uniform temperature field forming in <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> system. This improved <b>the</b> <b>curing</b> process and reduced the formation of volatile monomers, thereby decreasing the adverse impact of the generated volatile gases on the environment.
