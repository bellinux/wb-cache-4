And when one thing is <b>tackt</b> to another, and {{properly}} Cosolidated into one mighty Consolidator, no question but whoever shall {{go up to the}} Moon, will find himself so improv'd in this wonderful Experiment, that not a Man ever perform'd that wonderful Flight, but he certainly came back again as wise as he went.|$|E
60|$|Well, Gentlemen, {{and what}} if we are called High-flyers now, and an Hundred Names of Contempt and Distinction, what is this to the purpose? who {{would not be a}} High-flyer, to be <b>Tackt</b> and Consolidated in an Engine of such sublime Elevation, and which lifts Men, Monarchs, Members, yea, and whole Nations, up into the Clouds; and {{performs}} with such wondrous Art, the long expected Experiment of a Voyage to the Moon? And thus much for the Description of the Consolidator.|$|E

Where their Memories, {{thinking}} Faculties and Penetration, will no question be so <b>Tackt</b> and Consolidated, that when they return, they all Write Memoirs of the Place, and communicate to their Country the Advantages they have reapt by their Voyage, according to the laudable Example of their ...|$|E
60|$|You knew, that {{upon your}} Tacking the Crolians to the Tribute Bill, the Grandees must reject both, they having declar'd against reading any Bills <b>Tackt</b> together, as being against their Priviledges. Now {{if you had}} any Design, it must be to have the Bill of Tribute lost, and that must be to {{disappoint}} all the publick Affairs, expose the Queen, break all Measures, discourage the Confederates, and putting all things backward, bring the Gallunarian Forces upon them, and put all Solunaria into Confusion. Now Sir, says he, we cannot have such course Thoughts of you, as to believe you could design such dark, mischievous things as these, and therefore we chose to believe you all Fools, and not fit to be put into a Consolidator again; than Knaves and Traytors to your Country, and consequently fit for a worse Place.|$|E
60|$|In this advanc'd Station, {{we see it}} plainly by Reflexion, That the Dissenters, like {{a parcel}} of Knaves, have {{retained}} all the High-Church-men in their Pay; they are certainly all in their Pension-Roll: Indeed, I {{could not see the}} Money paid them there, it was too remote; but I could plainly see the thing; all the deep Lines of the Project are laid as true, they are so <b>Tackt</b> and Consolidated together, that if any one will give themselves leave to consider, they will be most effectually convinced, That the High-Church and the Dissenters here, are all in a Caball, a meer Knot, a piece of Clock-work; the Dissenters are the Dial-Plate, and the High-Church the Movement, the Wheel within the Wheels, the Spring and the Screw to bring all things to Motion, and make the Hand on the Dial-plate point which way the Dissenters please.|$|E
60|$|And {{from this}} Lunar Observation it {{presently}} occur'd to my Understanding, that my Masters the Dissenters {{may come in}} for a share among the Moon-blind Men of this Generation, since had they done for their own Interest what the Laws fairly admits to be done, had they been united among themselves, had they form'd themselves into a Politick Body to have acted in a publick, united Capacity by general Concert, and as Persons that had but one Interest and understood it, they had never been so often Insulted by every rising Party, they had never had so many Machines and Intrigues to ruin and suppress them, they had never been so often <b>Tackt</b> and Consolidated to Oppression and Persecution, and yet never have rebell'd or broke the Peace, incurr'd the Displeasure of their Princes, or have been upbraided with Plots, Insurrections and Antimonarchical Principles; when they had made Treaties and Capitulations with the Church for Temper and Toleration, the Articles would have been kept, and these would have demanded Justice with an Authority that would upon all Occasions be respected.|$|E
