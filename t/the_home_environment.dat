However, we know little about the interactions between ECEC quality and <b>the</b> <b>home</b> learning <b>environment.</b> We examine whether the child's attendance in a high ECEC quality setting improves the quality of her <b>home</b> learning <b>environment.</b> We use very rich data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), which provides detailed panel information through children's age of 6 months to 9 years on ECEC quality and on <b>the</b> child's <b>home</b> learning <b>environment.</b> Our analysis {{is based on a}} sample of 700 children who have been in non-family child care for at least 10 hours/week. We estimate level and value-added specifications and show that ECEC quality improves <b>the</b> <b>home</b> learning <b>environment</b> at various measurement points. The effects sizes indicate that an increase in ECEC quality by one standard deviation increases <b>the</b> <b>home</b> learning <b>environment</b> by about 0. 08 standard deviations. Furthermore, results differ by sub-groups: <b>The</b> <b>home</b> learning <b>environment</b> from more advantaged children benefits more from higher ECEC quality.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} concerning the role of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> in children 2 ̆ 7 s math development. In this study, we examined the relation between these constructs by specifically addressing three goals. The first goal was to identify the measurement structure of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> {{through a series of}} confirmatory factor analyses. The second goal was to examine the role of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> in predicting parent report of children 2 ̆ 7 s math skills. The third goal was to test a series of potential alternative explanations for the relation between <b>the</b> <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> and parent report of children 2 ̆ 7 s skills, specifically the direct and indirect role of household income, parent math anxiety, and parent math ability as measured by their approximate number system performance. A final sample of 339 parents of children aged 3 through 8 drawn from Mechanical Turk answered a questionnaire online. The best fitting model of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> was a bifactor model with a general factor representing <b>the</b> general <b>home</b> math <b>environment,</b> and three specific factors representing the direct numeracy environment, the indirect numeracy environment, and the spatial environment. When examining the association of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> factors to parent report of child skills, <b>the</b> general <b>home</b> math <b>environment</b> factor and the spatial environment were the only significant predictors. Parents who reported doing more general math activities in <b>the</b> <b>home</b> reported having children with higher math skills, whereas parents who reported doing more spatial activities reported having children with lower math skills. © 2016 Hart et al.

40|$|Youth {{obesity is}} an ongoing problem in the United States. Obese {{children}} and adolescents {{are likely to be}} obese as adults and have an increased risk of developing chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, earlier in life. The multifactorial nature of obesity continues to challenge researchers and health professionals to determine methods for preventing and reducing childhood obesity. Research has suggested that obesity is a normal response to an “obesigenic” environment. Emerging {{as one of the most}} influential environments in obesity and behavior development is <b>the</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment.</b> However, little is understood about the role of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment</b> in obesity and disease development in youth. The purpose of this research was to examine factors that influence <b>the</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment</b> as well as the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment</b> and dietary intake, obesity, and disease development in a nationally representative sample of U. S. youth aged 6 - 19 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Race-ethnicity and poverty income ratio (PIR) were found to influence home food availability, family meal patterns, and family food expenditures, three aspects of <b>the</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment.</b> Race-ethnicity, PIR, and home food availability appeared to influence dietary consumption in youth. However, home food availability did not appear to be related to overweight or obesity in youth. Overweight and obesity in children and adolescents was associated with adverse lipid concentrations. <b>The</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment</b> is complex but may serve as a modifiable area for nutrition educators to influence dietary intake in youth. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in <b>home</b> food <b>environments</b> should be addressed in the development of effective public policy and nutrition education development. Although <b>the</b> <b>home</b> food <b>environment</b> was not found to be related to obesity in youth, research should continue assessing environmental factors of obesity development as obesity is related to disease development earlier in life.

2500|$|One set {{of studies}} has {{reported}} differential item functioning – namely, some test questions function differently {{based on the}} racial group of the test taker, reflecting some kind of systematic difference in a groups ability to understand certain test questions or to acquire the knowledge required to answer them.

2500|$|Numerous {{studies are}} {{available}} to support the statement and prove that music should {{be an integral part}} of every child’s early development. Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner states that music intelligence is equal in importance to logical – mathematical intelligence, linguistic intelligence, spatial intelligence, bodily – kinesthetic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence. [...] It has also been proven that “music has been shown to be an effective method for relieving stress, curbing anxiety, reducing depression, and enhancing self-esteem. When music is systematically presented within <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>environment,</b> positive effects can be noted in family members.” [...] Through music and movement, these provide “patterned, repetitive neural input to the brainstem which would likely diminish anxiety, impulsivity, and other trauma-related symptoms” which can be found in people suffering from homelessness. The objective of the Music Together program at H4H is to participate in the transformation of lives and to facilitate the strengthening of the family bond through the active participation in a positive and encouraging musical setting.|$|E

2500|$|External and {{internal}} {{factors have been}} attributed to the decline of Igbo language usage. Preference for the English language in post-colonial Nigeria has usurped the Igbo language’s role and function in society, as English is perceived by Igbo speakers as the language of status and opportunity. This perception may be a contributor to the negative attitude towards the Igbo language by its speakers across the spectrum of socio-economic classes. [...] Igbo children’s reduced competence and performance has been attributed in part to the lack of exposure in <b>the</b> <b>home</b> <b>environment,</b> which impacts intergenerational transmission of the language. English is the official language in Nigeria and is utilized in government administration, educational institutions, and commerce. Aside from its role in numerous facets of daily life in Nigeria, globalization exerts pressure to utilize English as a universal standard language in support of economic and technological advancement. A 2005 study by Igboanusi and Peter demonstrated the preferential attitude towards English over the Igbo language amongst Igbo people in the communication, entertainment, and media domains. English was preferred by Igbo speakers at 56.5% for oral communication, 91.5% for written communication, 55.5-59.5% in entertainment, and 73.5-83.5% for media.|$|E
