50|$|In 1973 Suzuki the GT750K was {{announced}} with extra chrome plating and two 295 mm discs replacing the drum front brake. No other manufacturer was offering dual front disc brakes at this time, {{so this was}} quite a marketing coup for Suzuki. The following year the GT750L gained unitized/rack mounted 40 mm Mikuni CV type carburetors, a gear position indicator added to the instrumentation and redesigned side covers along with other detail changes. The connecting pipe between the exhausts was removed and the exhausts redesigned to improve road clearance. The engine was also re-tuned {{with an increase in}} power to 70 bhp for the Japanese domestic market starting in January, 1974. The rest of the world received these changes with the introduction of the 1975 Suzuki GT750M with the new silencers without connecting pipes, <b>raised</b> <b>gearing</b> and power output increased by 3 bhp, now giving a top speed of 120 mph. Handling and performance were thus improved.|$|R
50|$|The Manydown {{manor house}} was {{situated}} about one {{mile to the}} southwest of the village of Wooton St Lawrence and was surrounded by some 1,500 acres of parkland (reduced to 250 acres by the 20th century) along with 400 acres of plantations. The house itself was of considerable antiquity, some parts {{dating back to the}} 14th century, and included a central well, with a unique <b>raising</b> <b>gear</b> mechanism such that water could easily be conveyed to the upper rooms. The fabric of the house {{at the time of its}} demolition was mostly late 16th and early 17th century. Modernization had provided an elegant staircase leading to a grand first-floor drawing room which had a large bay window overlooking the impressive grounds. The house was built around a square court, known as Cheyney Court, on one side of which was the old court room, where the “courts Leet and Custumary” would be held.|$|R
40|$|Photographic survey {{techniques}} {{were employed to}} monitor {{the condition of the}} paintwork on the ceiling of the Queen's Staircase at Hampton Court Palace. Illumination was provided by a flash, mounted on an 8 metre <b>telescopic</b> mast, <b>raised</b> to approximately 60 cm below the ceiling, with images were taken from a fixed camera position {{on the floor of the}} landing at a range of 6. 5 m. The photometric stereo method was applied to images from ten lamp positions, to calculate surface normals and a depth map. Cross-sections at the estimated surface resolution of 7. 7 pixels/mm, achieved a depth (Z axis) resolution of approximately 100 microns...|$|R
5000|$|The Commander Elite {{improves}} on {{the original}} Commander in that it has <b>raised</b> landing <b>gear</b> that positions the engine thrustline vertically {{at the center of}} gravity, which eliminates changes in pitch with throttle changes. The gyroplane was designed to comply with the US Experimental - Amateur-built rules. It features a single main rotor, a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, tricycle landing gear and a twin cylinder, two-stroke, liquid-cooled, dual-ignition [...] Rotax 582 engine in pusher configuration.|$|R
5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air.

50|$|On October 8, 1979, Comair Flight 444 {{en route}} to Nashville, TN, a Piper PA-31 Navajo light aircraft, crashed shortly after takeoff from Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport. All eight people aboard were killed. The NTSB {{determined}} the probable cause of the accident was a partial loss of power immediately after liftoff. The pilot failed to take immediate corrective action, such as rejecting the takeoff or <b>raising</b> landing <b>gear</b> and flaps. Contributing factors were the pilot's inexperience with multi-engine aircraft, a hurried departure, inadequate training, inexperienced company management, and ineffective FAA certification and surveillance of the operator.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 January 1970, an Aspen Airways Convair CV-240-12 (registration N270L) {{landed on}} the runway with its landing <b>gear</b> <b>raised.</b> The pilot in command {{wanted to keep the}} {{airspeed}} above 130 knots in case a go-around was required, and failed to extend the landing gear on short final. The gear warning horn did not sound. There were no injuries.|$|R
50|$|When {{the pilot}} is {{instructed}} or {{decides to go}} around, the pilot applies full power to the engine(s), adopts an appropriate climb attitude and airspeed, <b>raises</b> the landing <b>gear</b> when the airplane is positively climbing, retracts the flaps as necessary, follows the instructions of the control tower (at a towered field), and typically climbs into the traffic pattern for another circuit if required.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980 Ali also {{appeared}} in a television ad for d-CON Roach Proof: after hitting a heavy bag (a training device suspended from above that simulates the bulk of an opponent for punching), {{he turns to the}} camera in his boxing <b>gear,</b> <b>raises</b> and shakes a fist, and exclaims to the audience, [...] "I don' want you livin' wit' roaches!" ...|$|R
25|$|December 26, 1973: The {{pilot of}} a Tricon International Airlines Beechcraft C-45H cargo transport, {{registration}} number N118X, lost control while circling Love Field for a precautionary landing after {{being unable to}} <b>raise</b> the landing <b>gear</b> during takeoff. The C-45 struck two houses southeast of the airport, killing the pilot and injuring a person on the ground. The crash was attributed to insufficient airspeed and improper loading.|$|R
50|$|In the 2007 session, Virginia General Assembly members {{representing}} Hampton reached a tentative deal to fill nominations for several Hampton judgeships {{that have been}} vacant for six years. Gear's insistence that his sister, Kathy Gear Owens, an attorney and substitute judge, be appointment to Hampton's Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court {{was one of several}} issues <b>raised</b> by <b>Gear</b> to hold up the appointment of the judges. Because the tentative deal included the appointment of his sister, Gear's fellow Senate Republicans walked off the floor in protest when the selections came up for a vote. Several democrats also voted against the resolution. During the 2009 General Assembly Session Gear Owens finally removed her name from consideration.|$|R
50|$|In {{summer of}} 2011, the {{objective}} was to match the A320neo 15% fuel burn advantage, but the initial reduction was 10-12%; it was later enhanced to 14.5%: the fan was widened from 61 in to 69.4 by <b>raising</b> the nose <b>gear</b> and placing the engine higher and forward, the split winglet added 1-1.5%, a relofted tail cone 1% more and controlling electronically the bleed air system improves efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|The {{probable}} {{cause for the}} crash of Flight 365 {{was determined to be}} [...] "The pilot slowed the aircraft and it stalled while the pilot prepared to be number one on landing as advised by Phuket approach control. It appears that he was worrying and not sure whether he could make number one landing because the pilot of number two aircraft in sequence gave warning that the number one aircraft ahead was above him and could not descend passing through his level. The pilot added power and <b>raised</b> the <b>gear</b> after stick shaker activated but didn't execute a recovery before hitting the sea." [...] In addition to pilot error, the air traffic controller was blamed for failing to keep Flight 365 and the Dragonair 737 adequately separated.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 January 1999 a F-27 (registration: G-CHNL) {{operating}} a cargo flight for Channel Express arriving from Luton crashed short of runway 27 after deploying full flap on approach. As the flap deployed, the cargo moved aft and exited the aeroplane's {{mass and balance}} limits, the flight crew initiated a go-around which further exacerbated problem by <b>raising</b> the <b>gear</b> and applying power. The aeroplane pitched up uncontrollably and stalled {{which resulted in the}} aircraft impacting the conservatory of a house located under the flight path. Fortunately no one on the ground was injured, however both flight crew were killed by the resulting fire which engulfed the aircraft. The investigation concluded the aeroplane was not loaded in accordance with the loadsheet.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} airborne, aircraft <b>raise</b> their landing <b>gear</b> and perform [...] "clearing turns" [...] {{to the right}} off the bow {{and to the left}} off the waist catapults. This ~10° check turn is to increase separation of (near) simultaneously launched aircraft from the waist/bow catapults. After the clearing turn, aircraft proceed straight ahead paralleling the ship's course at 500 ft until [...] Aircraft are then cleared to climb unrestricted in visual conditions.|$|R
50|$|On 6 March 2003 Air Algérie Flight 6289 crashed at 3:45 pm {{local time}} (1445 GMT). The flight was leaving Tamanrasset bound for Algiers with the {{co-pilot}} acting as pilot-in-command. At {{a height of}} 78 feet and a speed of 158 kts, the No. 1 engine suffered a turbine failure. The captain took control. The co-pilot asked if she should <b>raise</b> the <b>gear,</b> but the captain did not respond. The Boeing 737-200 lost speed, stalled, and broke up on rocky terrain about 1600 metres past the runway. The accident {{was caused by the}} loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem. There were 102 fatalities and one survivor.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} captain had the most mistakes, the first officer was also noted by the CAA in his failure of <b>raising</b> the landing <b>gear</b> while an {{in-flight}} emergency occurred. Investigators concluded that cockpit crew neither discussed nor <b>raised</b> the landing <b>gears</b> after takeoff. The wreckage also confirmed the landing gears in extended position {{at the time of}} ground impact. The Beechcraft-1900C aircraft will have very low rate of climb with landing gears in down position due to increased drag while operating with single engine. Any angle of bank is going to aggravate the situation and the marginal rate of climb would at one stage change into a rate of descend which actually happened in this particular case. The first officer was a qualified captain on Beechcraft-1900C aircraft, however his actions and assistance available to the captain of aircraft was not at optimum level. He failed to retract the landing gears after takeoff and undertook remedial actions well below the defined minimum safe altitude contrary to the recommended procedures, which shows his pre-occupation, anxiety and stress in handling abnormal situation. Due to these non conformances, the aircraft failed to achieve the safe flying parameters despite having a serviceable engine.|$|R
50|$|As {{the card}} was being read and {{positioned}} for printing, a ‘mechanical bail’ driven by large steel cams would <b>raise</b> 60 <b>geared</b> ‘lifter bars’ which engaged 60 ‘racks’ which engaged 60 ‘intermediate gears’, which drove 60 ‘print wheels’. (You {{can see the}} maintenance problem with 60 of just about everything). The lifter bars were then lowered under spring tension by the ‘mechanical bail’ {{in time with the}} reading of the punched card. Using the impulse from the ‘contact roll’ / ‘card brush’ / ‘wire contact relay’ circuitry, a ‘push rod’ would latch (stop) the individual ‘lifter bar’ on its downward motion with the character to be printed correctly positioned on the print wheel and facing 1 of 60 ‘print hammers’. An ‘alignment bail’ would then seat itself in between the teeth of the ‘print wheels’ to perform vertical alignment.|$|R
50|$|On December 18, 2015 Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board {{released}} {{their final}} report {{stating that the}} accident {{was caused by the}} inability of the captain to handle the abnormal operation of engine No 2 just after takeoff, failure of the cockpit crew to <b>raise</b> the landing <b>gear</b> after experiencing the engine anomaly, and execution of remedial actions by the first officer before the attainment of minimum safe altitude. The crew did not follow standard procedures, did not take proper actions, lacked situational awareness, experienced Crew Resource Management failure, and handled the anomaly unprofessionally.|$|R
5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the {{regulator}} valve V was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then {{closed and the}} water injection valve V briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and <b>raising</b> the pump <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Good {{aerodynamics}} {{enabled the}} car {{to make the best}} of the available power, but the car as launched nevertheless drew criticism that it was underpowered. Citroën addressed the issue with the introduction in September 1972, as an option, of a larger 1,222 cc engine. Claimed power increased from [...] to , but it was the improved torque that really marked out the more powerful engine, and which enabled the manufacturer, with the larger engined versions, to <b>raise</b> the second <b>gear</b> ratio and the final drive ratio, increasing the vehicle speed per 1,000 rpm from 23 km/h (14.3 mph) to 24.5 km/h (15.2 mph). Larger front brake discs were also fitted.|$|R
50|$|Berkuts used a {{retractable}} main (rear) {{landing gear}} system designed by Shirl Dickey for his E-Racer homebuilt. Originally Berkut used gear parts produced by Dickey, {{but over time}} they were repeatedly re-engineered and strengthened. Later kits had gear components produced entirely in-house. Like the earlier Vari-Eze and Long EZ, the Berkut parks with its nose gear retracted to prevent the plane from tipping over backwards when parked without a pilot in the front seat. Some early Berkuts utilized hydraulic nose-gear extension systems, but most have used an electro-mechanical jack-screw. With the electric system the pilot can climb into the cockpit with the nose down, then extend the nose <b>gear,</b> <b>raising</b> the airplane with him inside.|$|R
500|$|Flight tests {{proceeded}} fairly smoothly until 4May1978, when HB1001 {{was making}} its 36th flight. The aircraft pitched {{up just as}} it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot, Bill Park, to abort the landing and make a second attempt. The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi-retracted position. Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to climb again, and eject when his fuel ran out. The aircraft was destroyed on impact {{in the vicinity of}} the Groom Lake facility. Park survived, but suffered a concussion, forcing him to retire from further test flights. Dyson, who was in the chase plane, recounted: [...] "Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard... He [...] <b>raised</b> the <b>gear</b> on the go around, and when he tried to extend it on approach, only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down. All this time, gas was being consumed... I suggested he climb up to 10,000 feet for ejection... He started climbing, but the engine started flaming out, from the lack of fuel, so he ejected." ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the safety}} bicycle, {{bicycles}} {{did not have}} chains and the pedals were typically attached directly to the drive-wheel, thus limiting top speed by {{the diameter of the}} wheel and resulting in designs with front wheels as large as possible. Various linkage mechanisms were invented to <b>raise</b> the effective <b>gear</b> ratio, but with limited success. Using chain drive allowed the mechanical advantage between the drive and driven sprockets to determine the maximum speed, thereby enabling manufacturers {{to reduce the size of}} the driving wheel for safety. It also allowed for the development of variable gearing, allowing cyclists to adjust their gearing on the fly, to terrain or road inclination and their strength, obtaining an efficient and workable cadence at various speeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorders}} were recovered {{soon after the}} crash. Canadian investigators concluded that shortly after the twin-turboprop airliner lifted off the low pressure impeller from the no. 2 engine burst, causing the forward part of the no. 2 engine to separate. The flight crew were unable to <b>raise</b> the landing <b>gear</b> because debris from the engine damaged the electronic gear selection circuitry. This together with the exposed engine increased drag dramatically on the aeroplane, and the aircraft was unable to climb or maintain altitude during the final turn. The centre of gravity shifted beyond its aft limit due to the engine separation and passenger movement, causing the airspeed to drop below the minimum control speed shortly before the aircraft struck the hillside.|$|R
5000|$|The Lancaster uses a mid-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane configuration. The wing {{is constructed}} from five separate main sections while the fuselage is likewise composed of five sections. Aside {{from a few}} elements, such as the fabric-covered ailerons, the Lancaster's oval-shaped fuselage had an all-metal covering. All of the wing and fuselage sections were manufactured separately, during which they were outfitted {{with all of the}} required equipment in advance of final assembly being performed, as a measure intended to accelerate the rate of production. The Lancaster was equipped with a retractable main undercarriage and fixed tailwheel; the hydraulically-actuated main landing <b>gear</b> <b>raised</b> rearwards into recesses within the inner engine nacelles. The distinctive tail unit of the aircraft was outfitted with a large twin elliptical fins and rudder arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|The wagon (Colt 1500 Van) had a {{horizontally}} divided rear tailgate {{and used}} the shorter wheelbase body of the 1100; it was available in either Standard or DeLuxe trim. Equipped with a three-speed column-shifted manual, a four-speed model (Overtop, [...] "OT") was available on sedans. The fourth <b>gear</b> <b>raised</b> the top speed from 140 to 145 km/h. The Van versions, lower geared for more load capacity, could only reach 125 km/h. Later, a now extremely rare four-door wagon aiming for private buyers (unlike the Van commercial vehicle) was added, as for the Colt 1200. This was more comfortably equipped than the Van version, sitting on the longer wheelbase, and with unique rear bodywork. The short-lived wagon {{was replaced by the}} all-new Mitsubishi Delica in 1968.|$|R

5000|$|After World War II, Jabara {{considered}} {{leaving the}} military to attend college, but later decided to attend the Tactical Air School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. From 1947 to 1949 he was stationed on Okinawa with the 53d Fighter Group. At Okinawa in 1948, Jabara flew his first jet aircraft, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. Reflecting on the transition to jet aircraft, he said [...] "It was entirely different.

40|$|SUMMARY Piloted-simulator {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to determine takeoff and landing operating procedures for a supersonic cruise research transport con-cept that result in predicted noise levels which meet current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) noise-certification standards. The results of these studies indicate that with the use of standard FAA noise-certification test procedures, the simulated aircraft did not meet the FAA traded-noise-level standards during takeoff and landing. With the use of advanced test proce-dures, however, this simulated aircraft did meet the traded-noise-level stan-dards for average flight crew skills. The advanced takeoff procedures developed involve violating three of the current Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) noise-test conditions. These violations are thrust cutback at altitudes below 214 m (700 ft), thrust cutback level below that presently allowed, and configuration change (other than <b>raising</b> the landing <b>gear).</b> Of these rule violations, thrust cutback at altitudes below 214 m (700 ft) is of primary importance.
