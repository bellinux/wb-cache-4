40|$|In the United States {{statistics}} on {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STDs), other than gonorrhoea and syphilis, are meagre. In this study the relative and seasonal incidences of most STDs in an American clinic where 34, 938 patient visits were recorded {{over a two-year period}} (1975 - 76) are assessed. Gonorrhoea was the most common STD in male and female patients combined (18 %), while nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) was most common in men (23 %), and <b>vaginitis</b> (<b>trichomonal</b> 7. 5 %, yeast 7. 1 %, and non-specific 7. 1 %) was the most common in women. A significantly higher incidence of NGU occurred in Caucasian (63 %) than in black (42 %) men (P less than 0. 005). No other STD was diagnosed in more than 5 % of patients, and 31 % had normal findings on clinical examination and investigation, and could be described as the 'worried well'. Two or more STDs co-existed in 4. 2 % of patients. In 1976 the incidence of genital herpes and scabies decreased in contrast to other STDs and total patient visits, which increased. A seasonal peak in late summer and early autumn was observed for most STDs. These observations indicate the importance of a comprehensive approach when attempting to compile accurate {{statistics on}} selected epidemiological aspects of sexually transmitted diseases...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-four {{patients}} with vulvovaginitis and vaginal discharge were assessed clinically and had vaginal swabs taken {{in an effort}} to establish a definite diagnosis. A high incidence of fungous infection was found while there was a surprisingly low incidence of <b>Trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis.</b> These findings vary markedly from recent surveys in other countries (Delaha et al. (1964); Gray and Barnes, 1965; Desai et al., 1966) ...|$|E
40|$|A 24 -hr {{regimen of}} {{nimorazole}} (1 g. orally at 12 -hrly intervals for three doses) was compared with metronidazole (200 mg. three times daily for 7 days) {{in the treatment}} of <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis.</b> The two treatment schedules were given to alternate patients, pregnant women being excluded. One hundred cases were treated on each schedule; roughly one-fifth of the patients in each group defaulted. There were no observed failures with either schedule. The reasons for these exceptionally good results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Nifuratel (Magmilor) was {{compared}} with metronidazole (Flagyl) {{in the treatment}} of <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis</b> by a randomized double-blind trial. Only 18 out of 47 patients (38 %) treated with nifuratel were found to be cured, whereas 42 out of 49 patients (85 %) treated with metronidazole were cured. Severe reactions, necessitating withdrawal of treatment, occurred in three patients treated with nifuratel. There were no serious side-effects with metronidazole. The results of this trial indicate that nifuratel is not a satisfactory substitute for metronidazole {{in the treatment of}} trichomoniasis...|$|E
40|$|A 36 -year-old {{woman with}} {{symptomatic}} metronidazole-resistant <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis</b> for 10 years {{had a total}} of 22 courses of treatment with either metronidazole or tinidazole according to different schedules. The minimum trichomonicidal concentration of metronidazole for the strain of Trichomonas vaginalis isolated from the patient was 160 microgram/ml compared with 1. 25 - 10 microgram/ml for other freshly isolated strains. The former strain also showed a definitely decreased sensitivity to ornidazole and tinidazole (80 microgram/ml). The mechanisms behind the appearance of resistance in this clinical isolate are at present unknown and require further study from the theoretical {{as well as the}} therapeutic viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|An {{indirect}} haemagglutination assay (IHA) with polysaccharide and protein antigens of Trichomonas vaginalis and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{were used to}} test for antibodies against T vaginalis in 58 women with trichonomal vaginitis and 48 with non-specific vaginitis. Eleven antibody positive sera were used in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) to identify surface peptides that elicited antibody responses in infected women. The serological tests were less sensitive than biological tests (smear examination and culture); antibodies were detected in 22 of the 58 women with <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis</b> by IHA using polysaccharide as antigen, in 27 by IHA using protein antigen, and in 36 by ELISA. The ELISA was also found to be of low specificity. Only two of the 11 sera tested by RIPA showed positive reactions with surface antigens, which were confirmed by autoradiography...|$|E
40|$|A 46 -year-old {{woman was}} treated with oral {{metronidazole}} for <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis</b> and developed diarrhea, which persisted for five weeks. Tissue culture assay of stool super-natant showed a cytopathic toxin that was neutralized by Clostridium sordellii antitox-in, and cultures yielded Clostridium difficile, which produced a similar or identical cyto-toxin in vitro. This isolate proved sensitive to metronidazole at 0. 25 ug/rnl. Prior reports have indicated that metronidazole may also be used therapeutically in patients with antibiotic-associated colitis ascribed to other agents. The patient presented here shows the enigma that the same agent used for therapy of colitis may also cause this complication. There has been considerable progress {{in our understanding of}} the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis. Whereas earlier reports suggested Staphylococcus aureus as the responsible agent [1], recent work has impli-cated Clostridium difficile in a majority of case...|$|E
40|$|The {{reasons that}} some women develop {{symptomatic}} <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis,</b> whereas many other infected women remain asymptomatic, are unclear, {{but it has been}} suggested that Trichomonas vaginalis strains vary in their intrinsic virulence. We describe beta-hemolytic activity in T. vaginalis which correlates with virulence in patients as well as in an animal model and in tissue culture. Fresh T. vaginalis isolates from four women with severe, symptomatic trichomoniasis had high-level (86. 3 +/- 6. 6 %) hemolytic activity, whereas isolates from three completely asymptomatic women had low-level (45. 3 +/- 8. 4 %) hemolytic activity (P less than 0. 001). Hemolytic activity also correlated with the production of subcutaneous abscesses in mice (r = 0. 74) and with destruction of CHO cell monolayers (r = 0. 94). All of the 20 clinical isolates of T. vaginalis tested possessed hemolytic activity. The beta-hemolysin may be a virulence factor for T. vaginalis...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 4129 {{patients}} attended the STD clinic from 1996 to 1999. Of those 25. 75 &#x 0025; were STD cases. Male and female cases comprised 86 &#x 0025; and 14 &#x 0025; respectively.

40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis is " the {{microbial}} agent responsible for <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis,</b> a major {{sexually transmitted disease}} throughout the world (1 - 4). The complex events involved in trichomonad parasitism of host cells are poorly understood. We {{have focused on the}} ability of T. vaginaiis to selectively acquire host-derived macromolecules in order to better define host-trichomonad interactions (5 - 8). Trichomonad surface receptors are responsible for the selective and specific acquisition of host proteins, and the biologic properties conferred upon T. vaginalis by these host proteins appear to contribute to the parasitic attributes of these microorganisms (6 - 8). For example, trichomonads display proteolytic inhibitory properties after al-antitrypsin binding (6). Also, iron uptake and subsequent enhancement of important metabolic pathways follow T. vaginalis acquisition of human lactoferrin (8). Another class of host molecules essential for trichomonal growth and multiplication are lipids (7, 9). These host macromolecules are used by T. vaginalis presumably for membrane maintenance and synthesis. In a recent study, lipoprotein...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis) is a {{protozoan}} parasite causing trichomoniasis or <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis.</b> The {{infection is}} considered as non-viral {{sexually transmitted disease}} (STD). Metronidazole and Tinidazole are now the drugs of choice {{for the treatment of}} this infection. However, resistant to these drugs has also been reported. So it is necessary to search for effective alternative drugs with fewer side effects. Chaerophyllum macropodum (C. macropodum) plant have been used against some parasites. Therefore, in this study the effects of different extracts of this plant on T. vaginalis in culture media have been investigated. Methods: In this experimental study hydro-ethanol extracts of C. macropodum leaves were prepared. Anti-T. vaginalis activities of the extracts were tested in concentrations of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 and 150 mg/ml following 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation of cultured media. Results: All extract concentrations showed some degrees of growth inhibition activity on T. vaginalis. However crude extract was more efficient. Conclusion: C. macropodum showed an anti-T. vaginalis activity. More investigations are recommended to use this plant as an antiparasitic drug...|$|E
40|$|Background: Trichomoniasis is {{recognized}} as a major sexually transmitted dis-ease (STD) {{in the world and}} has the highest prevalence and incidence of STD. the prevalence strongly is related to cultural and social norms in different socie-ties, in relation to sexual partnership, monogamy, or polygamy. Our objective was to describe the frequency and natural history of infection and correlation of clini-cal signs with parasite detection. Methods: From February 2006 to March 2007, in a cross sectional study, clinical and wet mount examination of vaginal smear along with culture were performed on 683 women attending to private outpatient clinics in Hamadan, western Iran. Trichomoniasis was diagnosed based on major clinical symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed using wet mount microscopically and culture in Diamond medium. Results: Only 2. 2 % of patients with clinically diagnosed <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis</b> were positive for Trichomonas vaginalis by wet smear and culture. The mean age of patients was 33. 6 ± 9. 7 yr, and majority of them were married and non-pregnant. Some (5 patients) infected cases were divorced and others (7 patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Metronidazole is drug {{of choice}} {{recommended}} by WHO for treatment of trichomoniasis, however, some reports claims drug resistance in Trichomonas vaginalis isolates recently. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of metroni-dazole in resistant and sensitive strains, as well as genetic patterns of these stains by PCR method. Methods: From February 2006 to March 2007, in a cross sectional study, clinical and wet mount ex-amination of vaginal smear along with culture were performed on 683 women attending to public and private outpatient clinics in Hamadan. Trichomoniasis marked based on major clinical symptoms. Diagnosis confirmed using wet mount microscopically and culture in Diamond medium. A serial concentration of metronidazole was provided and all isolated Trichomonas strains (resistant and sensi-tive) tested by standard method. Finally, all sensitive and resistant strains examined by PCR tech-nique. Results: Only 15 / 683, (2. 2 %) of patients clinically diagnosed <b>trichomonal</b> <b>vaginitis</b> were positive for T. vaginalis by wet smear and culture. The minimum lethal concentration (MLC) for clinically sensi-tive isolates was 25 µg/ml; however, this concentration for resistant isolates was 200 µg/ml after 2...|$|E
