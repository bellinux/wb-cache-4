5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a <b>tortoise.</b> They would find a <b>tortoise</b> nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the <b>tortoise</b> is away. When it returns, the <b>tortoise</b> would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the <b>tortoise</b> would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the <b>tortoise,</b> which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|Disease. Increased {{disease in}} wild populations often follows {{weakening}} from other environmental stressors, such as habitat loss.

5|$|The <b>Tortoise</b> Club {{is open to}} the 1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid (as well {{as their}} {{respective}} coxwains), but does not extend to the Boat Club committee's Bosun (boatswain), Secretary, or Treasurer unless they are also 1st VIII, 1st Torpid, or coxwains to those boats. The unique emblem of the <b>Tortoise</b> Club is the <b>tortoise</b> badge. The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply use of the <b>Tortoise</b> emblem by the general Oriel College Boat Club membership or members of the Oriel Society – these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.|$|E
5|$|The long-time {{informal}} {{emblem of}} the <b>Tortoise</b> Club (1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid crews), was formalized in a grant to the College by Letters Patent dated 20 April 2009 of Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. The Badge is blazoned A <b>Tortoise</b> displayed the shell circular Azure charged with two concentric annulets Argent. The grant is formulated to provide the College, the Boat Club, and the Oriel Society (Oriel's Alumni society) use of the badge in relation to <b>Tortoise</b> Club alumni activities; the <b>Tortoise</b> Club is not itself an incorporated entity and does not bear Arms in its own right; therefore {{it could not be}} granted such a heraldic Badge directly.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert <b>tortoise</b> (California and Nevada) and the gopher <b>tortoise</b> (Georgia, also the {{official}} <b>tortoise</b> of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. Interestingly, all the non-turtle reptiles fall into this category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common snapping turtle (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E
50|$|On February 4, 2011, {{the first}} of the Arnold's giant <b>tortoises</b> were moved to North Island.

50|$|Shelters {{are often}} {{communal}} {{with as many}} <b>tortoises</b> as can fit in the space. Good shelters are so important, and visibility is so poor that the <b>tortoises</b> will leave scent trails that they or others can follow. Some shelters are so heavily used by <b>tortoises</b> that clear trails in the dirt lead to them, though individual <b>tortoises</b> may not return to a given shelter regularly.|$|R

50|$|Giant <b>tortoises</b> are {{characteristic}} reptiles {{that are currently}} found on two groups of tropical islands: the Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (a population at the Mascarene Islands was exterminated by the 1900s). These <b>tortoises</b> can weigh as much as 417 kg and can grow to be 1.3 m long. Giant <b>tortoises</b> originally {{made their way to}} islands from the mainland; for example, Aldabra Atoll and Mascarenes giant <b>tortoises</b> are related to Madagascar <b>tortoises</b> while Galapagos giant <b>tortoises</b> are related to Ecuador mainland <b>tortoises.</b> This phenomenon of excessive growth is known as island gigantism or insular gigantism. It occurs when the size of the animals that are isolated on an islands increases dramatically in comparison to their mainland relatives. This is due to several factors such as relaxed predation pressure, competitive release, or as an adaptation to increased environmental fluctuations on islands. However, giant <b>tortoises</b> are no longer considered to have been examples of island gigantism, as they originally evolved their massive sizes on the mainland. Giant <b>tortoises</b> were once common across the Cenozoic faunas of Eurasia, Africa and the Americas.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Large {{numbers of}} pancake <b>tortoises</b> (Malacochersus tornieri) and Horsfield <b>tortoises</b> (Testudo horsfieldii) in three {{consignments}} imported into Japan died soon after arrival. Some <b>tortoises</b> {{in the first}} con-signment were dead on arrival. Postmortem examination {{of two of the}} pancake <b>tortoises</b> and four of the Horsfield <b>tortoises</b> revealed necrotizing lesions of the oral mucosa in both species, primarily in the tongue. Eosinophilic to amphophilic inclusion bodies were visible in the nuclei of mucosal epithelial cells in the lesions. Similar inclusion bodies were observed in the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, lungs, kidneys, small and large intestines, pancreas, and cerebrum of the pancake <b>tortoises</b> and in the liver, spleen, and pancreas of the Horsfield <b>tortoises.</b> Electron microscopic examination of the cells containing inclusion bodies showed herpesvirus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm. Nested polymerase chain reaction analysis using a her-pesvirus consensus primer method confirmed the presence of a characteristic herpesvirus base sequence in tissue from these lesions.

5|$|The species most {{frequently}} adopted {{as a state}} reptile is the painted turtle, with four states designating it: Colorado (the western subspecies), Illinois, Michigan, and Vermont. Three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi—represent themselves with the American alligator. A species of box turtle, Terrapene carolina or common box turtle, has been chosen by three states, with North Carolina and Tennessee using the Terrapene carolina carolina (eastern box turtle) subspecies, and with Missouri using the Terrapene carolina triungus (three-toed box turtle) subspecies. Two bordering western states, California and Nevada, chose the desert <b>tortoise.</b> The loggerhead sea turtle was named by South Carolina as state reptile, while Florida chose it as state saltwater reptile. Florida also named an official <b>tortoise,</b> the gopher <b>tortoise,</b> the same animal as Georgia's state reptile.|$|E
40|$|Desert <b>tortoises</b> (Gopherus agassizii) {{occurring}} {{east and}} south of the Colorado River form the "Sonoran population," a regulatory designation of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, whereas <b>tortoises</b> west and north of the river constitute the "Mojave population. " This distinction is based on significant genetic, morphometric and ecological differences. However, mitochondrial DNA, morphometric, and ecological data from the eastern bajada of the Black Mountains (about 40 km east of the Colorado River) identify the evolutionary affinities of those <b>tortoises</b> as Mojavean: ten of eleven Black Mountain <b>tortoises</b> possessed the Mojave genotype, twenty-four of thirty-seven <b>tortoises</b> predominantly expressed the Mojave phenotype, and all <b>tortoises</b> were similar to Mojave populations in macrohabitat selection. Some ecological and behavioral attributes such as home range size and hibernaculum selection did not differ among Mojave, Sonoran, and Black Mountain <b>tortoises.</b> Several hypotheses on how the Mojave trait became established in the Black Mountains are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Gopher <b>tortoises</b> are {{herbivore}} scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, wiregrass, and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, gopher <b>tortoises</b> eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (Spanish and ball moss), Richardia, and Dyschoriste. Juvenile <b>tortoises</b> tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature <b>tortoises.</b> Gopher <b>tortoises</b> {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As gopher <b>tortoises</b> usually get water from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|R
