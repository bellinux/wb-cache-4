5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that fibril ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained}} by taking into account fibril breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of fibril growth and fibril breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E
40|$|Physicochemical {{simulation}} (pH, electrolytes and temperature) {{of three}} physiological media {{was carried out}} in order to follow the release of trace elements contained in seven edible clays (mainly kaolinite, illite, muscovite and quartz) collected from the West African countries of Cote d'Ivoire, Guinee and Senegal. These clays are ingested by pregnant women for diverse reasons that are related to their condition. Simulated oral (6. 5 pH 7), stomach (pH approximately 1. 8) and intestinal (pH approximately 8. 3) media were prepared separately in order to compare <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace elements released. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry and spectrophotometry for the evaluation of copper, iron ((Fe(II) and Fe(III)), lead, manganese, nickel and zinc, since some of these elements can palliate deficiency problems and others can induce toxic effects. <b>The</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical elements released were pH dependent. The lower the pH, <b>the</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> copper, Fe(III) and zinc. <b>The</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> Fe(II) were similar at both lower (stomach) and higher (intestinal) pH values. However, <b>the</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> manganese, nickel and lead were lower than quantification limits.

5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
