Players assume the role of a young man named Senel, who must rescue his sister from individuals who believe her to be a prophesied savior, while the mysteries of his world begin to unravel before him. It received mostly mixed reviews upon its release in North America, with critics routinely commending the title's music while panning its derivative plot and tedious pace, and would sell approximately 397,000 copies worldwide.|$|E

The documentary also draws on many studies interviews of researchers, counselors and psychologists, along with interviews of numerous former military brats.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{next-generation}} sequencing {{has also made}} large-scale population sequencing feasible, for example the 1000 Genomes Project to characterize variation in human population groups. While common variation is easily captured, rare variation poses a design challenge: too few samples with significant sequence redundancy risks not having a variant in the sample group, but large samples with light redundancy risk not capturing a variant in the read set <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> in the sample group. Wendl and Wilson report a simple set of optimization rules that maximize the probability of discovery for a given set of parameters. For example, for observing a rare allele at least twice (to eliminate the possibility is unique to an individual) {{a little less than}} 4-fold redundancy should be used, regardless of the sample size.|$|E
25|$|Annual {{wind power}} {{production}} is currently (2014) equal to about 39% of electricity consumed in Denmark. The proportion of this <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> consumed in Denmark has been disputed, as the considerable hydropower resources of Norway (and to some extent, Sweden) {{is used as}} grid storage with low loss. Hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating power, saving water for later, and can export electricity to Denmark when wind power output drops. Short term, Denmark imports electricity from Norway during daytime and exports in nighttime. Long term, Denmark imports electricity in summer and exports in winter. Wind is higher in autumn and winter, when consumption is also high. This service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found {{around the world in}} pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants.|$|E
25|$|In 1732 Lord Cobham's nephew Gilbert West wrote {{a lengthy}} poem, The Gardens of the Right Honourable Richard Viscount Cobham, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> {{a guide to}} the gardens in verse form. Charles Bridgeman {{commissioned}} 15 engravings of the gardens from Jacques Rigaud which were published in 1739. In 1744 Benton Seeley published A Description of the Gardens of Lord Cobham at Stow Buckinghamshire. In 1748 William Gilpin produced the Views of the Temples and other Ornamental Buildings in the Gardens at Stow followed in 1749 by A Dialogue upon the Gardens at Stow. Unlicensed copies of all three books were published in 1750 by George Bickham as The Beauties of Stow. To cater to the large number of French visitors, a French guidebook, Les Charmes de Stow, was published in 1748. In the 1750s Jean-Jacques Rousseau had visited the gardens and his writings about the gardens helped spread their fame and influence throughout Europe. He had this to say 'Stowe is composed of very beautiful and very picturesque spots chosen to represent different kinds of scenery, all of which seem natural except when considered as a whole, as in the Chinese gardens of which I was telling you. The master and creator of this superb domain has also erected ruins, temples and ancient buildings, like the scenes, exhibit a magnificence which is more than human'. Georges-Louis Le Rouge published in 1777 Détails de nouveaux jardins à la mode that included engravings of buildings at Stowe as well as at other famous gardens in Britain. In Germany Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld published Theorie der Gartenkunst in 5 volumes in Leipzig 1779–1785, that included Stowe. The last edition of the Seeley guide was published in 1827. In 1805-9 John Claude Nattes painted 105 wash drawings of both the house and gardens.|$|E

25|$|In the 1997–1998 anime series Street Fighter II V, Chun-Li is {{introduced}} as the fifteen-year-old daughter of Inspector Dorai, a Hong Kong police chief {{who has also}} schooled her in the martial arts. While attempting to bring down a drug smuggling operation in the country, he works with Interpol to investigate a mysterious organization known as Shadowlaw. Chun-Li serves as the tour guide for Ryu and Ken when they {{pay a visit to}} work on their training; Ken is smitten with her and later buys her lavish gifts, including an engagement ring. Despite being underage, they enter a club in a dangerous part of town that hosts an underground fighting ring so Ryu and Ken can prove themselves as street fighters. After Ryu soundly defeats several opponents, the trio are marked for death by the ringleader as a result, and while on the run they encounter and battle various street gangs before being rescued by Chun-Li's father. Traveling with Ryu and Ken to Spain, Chun-Li is stalked by an obsessive Vega, who presents her with a severed bull's ear, intercepts her outside her hotel, sneaks into her room to observe her in her sleep, then invites her to a masquerade ball <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a setup to get Ken to fight him in a cage match. The whole time, Chun-Li is under the influence of Vega's love potion, but it wears off when Vega is defeated. Bison then accosts Chun-Li and she realizes that he is the leader of Shadowlaw, who, unbeknownst to her, had also hired Cammy to garrote Chun-Li's father, an attack he barely survives. Chun-Li plays her largest role in the five-part finale, when she and Ryu are kidnapped and brainwashed by Bison via microchips embedded in their foreheads, and like in the 1994 film, she acquires her signature outfit (albeit grayish-blue with white accents and slightly modified) while Bison's captive. The chip puts her into an overly aggressive state, which she displays by snapping an opponent's neck in combat, and she later manages to overpower Guile in battle before Ryu and Ken, during their victorious final fight against Bison, succeed in destroying the equipment triggering the chips (in addition to reducing the Shadowlaw base to ruins), returning Chun-Li to normal.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the broadcast, {{alongside}} {{similar concerns}} {{for the well-being of}} the snake, Laura Bradley of Slate argued that Eaten Alive was a further example of Discovery Channel's recent uses of sensationalism and pseudoscience to attract viewers, as opposed to airing content that is legitimately educational. She compared the special to Shark Week (which she described as the network's [...] "biggest pieces of viewer bait" [...] for [...] "capitalizing on people's fear of sharks while simultaneously misinforming the public about an animal <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> in danger"), the aforementioned Nik Wallenda specials, and [...] broadcast by sister network Animal Planet.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{what happens}} in Perl's compile phase is compilation, and most {{of what happens}} in Perl's run phase is execution, but there are {{significant}} exceptions.

The terms that indicate the kind of processing <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> occurring at any moment are compile time and run time.

500|$|Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics, with Don of Square Enix Music Online stating {{that while some}} of Ishimoto's and all of Toyama's arrangements were excellent, the original pieces {{that made up the}} bulk of the album offered [...] "very little <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> worth a listen". Gann was more lenient, praising Ishimoto for writing [...] "an excellent soundtrack" [...] and being especially happy with the quality of the arrangements of Uematsu's pieces. Gann did, however, note that because Ishimoto's original works were more ambient, his arrangements, and by extension Uematsu's work, far outshone his own new contributions. He also felt that the theme song [...] "Why" [...] was [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "bland". Sophia Tong of IGN described the album as a [...] "mixed bag", stating that some of the arrangements and new tracks were [...] "fantastic" [...] while others were [...] "not all that compelling", and lamented the overuse of a few themes throughout the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|... "It Came {{from the}} Nightosphere" [...] was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar, from {{a story by}} Merriwether Williams, Steve Little, Patrick McHale, Pendleton Ward, and Thurop Van Orman. The episode was the first episode storyboarded by Sugar; {{according}} to her, she [...] "did all the monster stuff at the end", whereas Muto [...] "did all the meat in the middle". She later joked that [...] "anything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> witty was done by Adam. I’m usually responsible for sex jokes and violence." [...] During the storyboarding process, Sugar and Muto were running low on time, As such, Muto asked fellow series artist Jesse Moynihan if he could help storyboard the initial fight between Marceline and her father. The final scene with Abadeer, which featured Finn cutting open his [...] "soul sack" [...] was added by Sugar based on a drawing by Ward that featured Finn {{flying through the air}} with two swords. However, she was not sure if the scene would make it into the final product due to its graphic nature. A scene that features Marceline's dad confronting Gunter the penguin inspired the writers to pen the fourth season episode [...] "Reign of Gunters".|$|E
500|$|Pet Shop (set number 10218), {{released}} in May 2011, is the sixth {{set in the}} Modular Buildings series. [...] The set contains 2032 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. It is the first set in the series <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> made out of 2 buildings that separate using the same Technic pins that link the rest of the modulars together. They can be reversed or separated and wrapped around another building. The brown building is a town house and the sand blue building is the Pet Shop. The brown building is the only building, with the exception of Market Street, that has a basement. There is a special feature on the Pet Shop on the ground floor, where the staircase can be folded away for more access room for playing (this was an issue with Market Street). There are 4 minifigures, 2 parrots and a fish tank with goldfish. The set also includes 3 dog bones, a ball, a frog toy, a birdhouse, a bucket and a brush. This is also the smallest set by height and stands at just over 25cm. The next tallest modular is Market Street at 33cm. The set includes a full interior including a toilet, bed, kitchen and fireplace.|$|E

[...] Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film [...] "works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three". He added that the film will become [...] "a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age."
