5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the roots.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or very close to <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
40|$|Fresh {{shallow water}} tables can {{contribute}} positively towards crop production by increasing <b>soil</b> moisture in <b>the</b> root zone. However, few Australian sugar growers consciously reduce their irrigation rates {{to take advantage}} of this valuable resource. In a field trial at Bundaberg, crop response to irrigation was measured when a shallow water table was situated between 1 and 1. 2 metres below <b>the</b> <b>soil?s</b> <b>surface.</b> Under these conditions, the water table provided approximately 23 % of the crop's evapotranspiration. In addition, crop responses showed that irrigation might be unnecessary when the water table is within one metre of <b>the</b> <b>soil's</b> <b>surface.</b> [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm below <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> Pupae are {{brown in}} color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface),</b> and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} pachypodium have {{developed}} geophytic pachycaul trunks, or trunks that are beneath <b>the</b> <b>soil's</b> <b>surface.</b> These geophytic trunks are caudexes, enlarged stems or trunks that store water.

50|$|The {{species has}} a basal rosette of long {{strap-like}} leaves, emerging at <b>the</b> <b>soil's</b> <b>surface</b> from a rhizome beneath.

5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface)</b> genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E
25|$|Open {{systems are}} also not as {{sensitive}} to soil structure variation, or to boundary layer resistance issues at <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> Air {{flow in the}} chamber at <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> is designed to minimize boundary layer resistance phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|The surface {{condition}} factor is when banking by flood spreading can change <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> physical conditions.

40|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} in accurately interpreting surface emissivity spectra, problems remain {{in the application of}} passive microwave satellite observations over land surfaces. This study develops a parameterized <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> emissivity model to quantify the microwave emissivity accurately and rapidly for Gaussian-correlated rough surfaces. We first analyze the sensitivity of surface emissivity to parameters using the advanced integral equation model (AIEM) simulated data. On the basis of the analysis and previous empirical models, two function factors that consider the polarization dependence of surface reflectivity are developed in <b>the</b> parameterized <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> emissivity model. These factors also comprehensively account for the effects of <b>surface</b> roughness, <b>soil</b> moisture, and incident angle. A comparison with the AIEM simulated data indicates that the absolute error of effective reflectivity estimated by <b>the</b> parameterized <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> emissivity model is small with a magnitude of 10 − 2. Validation through experimental measurements suggests that a good agreement could be obtained. <b>The</b> parameterized <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> emissivity model is applied to simulate satellite measurements of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Compared with the commonly-used microwave land emissivity model developed by Weng et al. (2001), the simulation results using <b>the</b> parameterized <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> emissivity model yield a lower root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the overall errors are reduced, particularly for horizontal polarization. <b>The</b> newly-developed parameterized <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> emissivity model should be useful in improving our understanding and modeling the measurements of passive microwave radiometers...|$|R

25|$|In botany, stolons are stems which grow at <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> or {{just below}} ground that form {{adventitious}} roots at the nodes, and new plants from the buds. Stolons are often called runners. Rhizomes, in contrast, are root-like stems that may either grow horizontally at <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> {{or in other}} orientations underground. Thus, not all horizontal stems are called stolons. Plants with stolons are called stoloniferous.|$|E
40|$|Soil acidity {{and calcium}} (Ca) {{availability}} in <b>the</b> sur-face <b>soil</b> differ substantially beneath sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga cana-densis) trees in a mixed forest in northwestern Con-necticut. We determined {{the effect of}} pumping of Ca from deep soil (rooting zone below 20 -cm min-eral <b>soil)</b> to explain <b>the</b> higher available Ca content in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil</b> beneath sugar maple. We mea-sured the atmospheric input of Ca with bulk depo-sition collectors and estimated Ca weathering and Ca mineralization in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil</b> (rooting zone above 20 -cm mineral soil) from strontium isotope measurements and observed changes in exchange-able Ca in soils during field incubation. Calcium leaching at 20 cm was calculated by combining modeled hydrology with measured Ca soil solution concentrations at 20 -cm depth. We measured root length distribution with depth beneath both tree species. Calcium leaching from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil</b> was much higher beneath sugar maple than hemlock and was positively related {{with the amount of}} Ca available in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil.</b> Calcium leaching from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil</b> beneath sugar maple was higher than the combined Ca input from atmospheric dep-osition and soil weathering. Without Ca uptake in <b>the</b> deep <b>soil,</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soils</b> are being depleted in Ca, especially beneath sugar maple. More organically bound Ca was mineralized beneath sugar maple than beneath hemlock. A relatively small part of this Ca release was leached below <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil,</b> suggesting that, beneath both tree species, most of the Ca cycling is occurring in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil.</b> Sugar maple had more fine roots in <b>the</b> deep <b>soil</b> than hemlock and a greater potential to absorb Ca in <b>the</b> deep <b>soil.</b> With a simple model, we showed that a relatively small amount of Ca uptake in <b>the</b> deep <b>soil</b> beneath sugar maple is able to sustain high amounts of available Ca in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>soil.</b> Key words: calcium uptake; calcium cycling; cal-cium depletion; tree species; deep soil; roots; model...|$|R

50|$|The use {{of plastic}} mulch {{requires}} a unique application process to ensure proper {{placement of the}} plastic film. This application process begins with preparing the field the same way one would for a flat seed bed. The bed must be free of large soil clods and organic residue. A machine called a plastic layer or a bed shaper is pulled over the field creating a row of plastic mulch covering a planting bed. These beds can be a flat bed which simply means {{the surface of the}} plastic mulch is level with <b>the</b> inter-row <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> Machines that form raised beds create a plastic surface higher than <b>the</b> inter-row <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> basic concept of the plastic bed shaper is a shaping box which creates the bed that is then covered by plastic via a roller and two coulters that cover the edges of the plastic film to hold <b>the</b> plastic <b>the</b> <b>soil’s</b> <b>surface.</b> These plastic layers also place the drip irrigation line under the plastic while the machine lays the plastic. It is somewhat important that the plastic is rather tight. This becomes important in the planting process.|$|R
40|$|The {{exchange}} {{process in}} the lower region of a maize canopy is analyzed for two nights.

The released sensible heat at <b>the</b> <b>soil's</b> <b>surface</b> can be easily calculated by applying the Nusselt number for free convection. At night thermal energy is also released through cooling of the canopy. The released heat from the stored canopy heat is of the same order of magnitude as all other energy terms.

A maximal possible estimate of dew accumulation for a particular night can easily be made by using the potential dew. The potential dew can be deduced more accurately by taking into account the released heat stored in the plant canopy...|$|R

25|$|Fire has {{important}} {{effects on the}} abiotic (non-living) components of an ecosystem, particularly the soil.

By removing overhead vegetation, fire can lead to increased solar radiation on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> by day, resulting in greater warming, and to greater cooling through the loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves left to intercept rain will allow more moisture to reach <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> In addition, plant transpiration (the process by which water travels through plants and evaporates through pores in the leaves) will be reduced following a fire, allowing the soil to retain more moisture.|$|E
