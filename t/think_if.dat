5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you want to exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have. At first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that {{is rooted in the}} ground, and {{transfer}} it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit. And if it does, the fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of nature. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I had left my country, I would be the same as the tree.|$|E

500|$|After the stage, Matthews {{said that}} he felt he could win the overall general classification. He said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I can survive Saturday , I can win. With the way I’ve been climbing, I think it’s possible." [...] Contador, meanwhile, said that the final climb of Stage 6 was not very steep and {{that it might be}} {{difficult}} to put significant time into Matthews.|$|E
500|$|Bolton defender Alan Stubbs was {{confident}} Bolton could cause Liverpool problems: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you look round the team {{we have got}} good quality everywhere and that's why we are doing so well, we have also got good players in reserve who {{can come in and}} do a job. We have played together {{for a long time and}} we are strong both mentally and physically this year. And if the forwards have not been scoring, the midfield and wingers have." ...|$|E
500|$|In another memo, Steinbeck {{noted that}} the pathos of Suzy being a prostitute had given much of the {{dramatic}} tension to the scene in which Doc rejects Suzy, and later, her rejection of him. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you will finally bring {{the theme of this}} play into the open, but wide open, you will have solved its great weakness and have raised it to a high level... If this is not done, I can neither believe nor take Pipe Dream seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{elections}} that followed {{were marked by}} violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since A Man of the People, Achebe replied: [...] "I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated." [...] After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument– which almost became a fistfight– with Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.|$|E
500|$|... "Polkarama!", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} during the second parody session. Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> I didn't do a polka medley." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E

500|$|Angelou chose [...] "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" [...] as the volume's title {{because of}} her {{interest}} in unconscious innocence, which she says is [...] "even lovelier than trying to remain innocent." [...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we <b>think</b> <b>if</b> we asked our murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please give me a cool drink of water?' and he would do so'". [...] Angelou has said that if she [...] "didn't believe that, [...] wouldn't {{get up in the}} morning".|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Strummer's daughters, Jazz and Lola, gave a rare {{interview}} {{to discuss the}} upcoming tenth anniversary of their father's passing, his legacy {{and the possibility of}} a Clash reunion had their father lived. Jazz said [...] "There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. But I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> Dad hadn't died, it would have happened. It felt like it was in the air." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{was aware}} {{from the outset}} that her {{circumstances}} would make her vulnerable to [...] "ladies who lunch"-style remarks (sometimes made against women, married to wealthy, high-profile men, who engage in charitable activities), but said, [...] "People who criticise these women are probably giving into cynicism, and I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you get cynical about life, you lose the real meaning of it." [...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making. In 2009, she staged a public abseil of the 17-storey Elysian Tower in Cork to raise funds for the organisation.|$|E

Auld Petey stamped wi' rage when he heard that, and Martha Scrymgeour said, 'Oh, the pridefu' limmer!'" ...|$|R
500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As far as I am concerned personally, it's probably preferable that we lost. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> we had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|Armagh manager Joe Kernan {{claimed he}} would have {{resigned}} had his side won but defeat encouraged him to continue. He lauded his players for their effort nonetheless, saying: [...] "..we've won an All-Ireland, and {{got back to the}} final. I think that's a phenomenal achievement." [...] He added that he was confident Armagh would win another title in the future. Of the match itself, Kernan said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> Steven McDonnell had got that goal towards the end, even with the man down I think we would have won the game. Big matches hinge on certain things {{and that was one of}} them." [...] McDonnell applauded Conor Gormley's tackle which prevented him from scoring: [...] "...I'd say it was one of the best tackles ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well it's {{something}} of the sort, no matter what--but cold water {{is at the bottom}} of it, and they do say it's a good remedy. Now Rose's aunt <b>thinks</b> <b>if</b> cold water is what is wanted, there is no place where it can be so plenty as out on the ocean. Sea-air is good, too, and by taking a v'y'ge her niece will get both requisites together, and cheap." ...|$|R

500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, Puerto Rican singer/actor Ricky Martin {{posted on}} his website [...] "To amend the Constitution goes beyond party ideologies. Don't let fear and {{frustration}} decide your vote. The rights {{we already have}} shouldn't be relinquished." [...] René Pérez, from Calle 13, also invited people to vote [...] "No" [...] to the amendments. Pérez wrote on his Facebook page [...] "You wouldn't amputate an arm or a leg, unless it was to save your life. The same happens with freedom. The right for bail is part of it. You shouldn't vote to have {{a part of you}} amputated. <b>Think.</b> <b>If</b> one day you're wrongly accused, you {{should have the right to}} be free while you wait to prove it" [...] and added [...] "Limit the weapons, not our rights." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{response}} to the controversy generated by the removal of Confederate monuments as highlighted by the August, 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Barkley stated, [...] "I’ve never thought about those statues a day in my life. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you asked most black people to be honest, they ain’t thought a day in their life about those stupid statues. What we as black people need to do: We {{need to worry about}} getting our education, we need to stop killing each other, we need {{to try to find a}} way to have more economic opportunity and things like that. Those things are important and significant. You know, I’m wasting time and energy [...] screaming at a neo-Nazi, or [...] ‘Man, you’ve got to take this statue down.'” ...|$|E
