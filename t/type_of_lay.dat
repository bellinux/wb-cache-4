30|$|The {{observance}} of fasting is {{not restricted to}} Jain ascetics because lay members of the religion practice it regularly during the fall festival of Paryusam, involving fasting {{for longer periods of}} time in addition to the usually observed twice a month regimen of fasting by the laity. Whatever the length of fasting, it is always associated with a strict vegetarian diet. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> observance is intimately connected with the Jain conviction that consciousness is a feature of many natural phenomenon within the world, such as a rock, water, fire, air, and plant, because each of these things possess a soul that expresses its consciousness through ordinary sense faculties, such as touch, taste, smell, and sight (Chapple 2011). It is the central nature of fasting in the Jain religion and its rejection of the sacredness of food that distinguishes its path from the Brāhmanical tradition and from the Buddhist path by making fasting a central feature of the ascetic path and practice of the laity (Jaini 2000).|$|E

40|$|Uskonnollisissa yhteisöissä pidetään yleensä itsestään selvänä, että Raamattu puhuttelee lukijaansa. Tässä tutkimuksessa analysoidaan autenttisia raamatuntutkimistilanteita, adventistien raamatuntutkisteluja, ja eksplikoitu niitä keinoja, joilla tutkistelujen osallistujat löytävät Raamatusta kertomuksista niiden puhuttelevuuden. Ensisijaisena metodina on etnometodologinen keskustelunanalyysi, joka perustuu vuorovaikutuksen yksityiskohtaiseen analyysiin. Raamatuntutkistelu on institutionaalinen tilanne, jossa osallistujat lukevat Raamatun tekstejä, keskustelevat Raamatussa kerrotuista tapahtumista ja pyrkivät soveltamaan niitä omaan elämäänsä. Tutkimuksessa havaittiin, että Raamatun puhuttelevuutta rakennetaan sekä silloin, kun puhutaan Raamatun kertomuksista, että silloin, kun puhutaan osallistujien elämästä. Päähuomio kohdistuu siihen, miten osallistujat puhuvat Raamatun tapahtumista. Ensinnäkin he kiinnittävät kertomuksissa huomioita seikkoihin, jotka ovat heille potentiaalisesti relevantteja. Toiseksi he tekevät päätelmiä kertomusten henkilöiden tunteista, motiiveista, henkilökohtaisista ominaisuuksista ja tapahtumien olosuhteista. Kolmanneksi he tekevät yleistyksiä, esittävät kertomuksen henkilöt, heidän toimintansa, sanansa tms. yleisempien kategorioiden edustajina. Neljänneksi he käyttävät Raamatun kertomuksista puhuessaan oman elämänsä kannalta relevantteja sanoja ja ilmauksia. Omista kokemuksistaan puhuessaan raamatuntutkistelun osallistujat tekevät niistä samanlaisia kuin Raamatun henkilöiden kokemuksista. He nimeävät niitä samoin kuin Raamatun henkilöiden kokemuksia, käyttävät Raamatusta lainattuja sanoja niitä kuvatessaan, ja esittävät itsensä samanlaisissa rooleissa kuin Raamatun henkilöt. Raamatuntutkistelussa keskustelua ohjailee opettaja, ja vuorovaikutus perustuu pitkälti opettajan kysymyksiin ja tutkistelijoiden vastauksiin. Opettajan ja osallistujan mahdollisuudet osallistua keskusteluun ovatkin yhtäältä epäsymmetriset, toisaalta puhuttelevuuden löytäminen Raamatun teksteistä on kuitenkin yhteistyötä, johon sekä opettaja että tutkistelijat osallistuvat. Tutkimus on ensisijaisesti analyysi yhdestä erityisestä institutionaalisesta tilanteesta ja uskonnollisesta toiminnasta, mutta tuloksia pohditaan myös yleisempien kysymysten kannalta. Näitä ovat maallikkoeksegetiikan ja tieteellisen eksegetiikan välinen suhde, teksteistä puhuminen, opettamisen konventiot, vuorovaikutuksen ja kieliopin välinen suhde sekä kulttuuristen resurssien käyttö vuorovaikutuksessa. The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to describe}} the Seventh-day Adventist Bible study as situated action. The methodology is based on ethnomethodological conversation analysis. The data consists of audio-recordings of Bible study interaction in Tampere, Finland. The Bible study in an institution {{with a history of}} almost 150 years, and {{it is part of the}} weekly worship service in the Seventh-day Adventist church. It is based on an international study book that includes the texts that should be studied and some comments on them. It is chaired by a pre-assigned teacher. These teachers are often lay people, but they are in charge of the interaction in the Bible study. The interaction consists mainly of the reading of Bible texts, teachers monologues and question­answer­comment sequences. The turn-taking is close to that of formal classroom interaction. It is common sense in most Christian circles that the Bible speaks to the one who studies it. This study is about how this speaking is accomplished, how the participants of the Bible study make Bible stories relevant to themselves so that the Bible can speak to them. They usually do it in two phases that alternate with each other during the Bible study. First they discuss the Bible story. In this phase they implicitly apply the story to their own life in various ways. In the second phase they explicitly talk about their own life world: about personal experience, about the state of the church or the surrounding world etc. The main focus of the study is on the first phase, the implicit application of the story. Four different ways the participants use to make the Bible story speak to them have been analyzed. First, they draw attention to those aspects of the story that are potentially relevant to them. They can draw attention to a single word or expression, to an activity in the story or to recurrent tendencies in a longer stretch of the story. Second, the participants make inferences. They infer the feelings, motives, character traits etc. of the characters of the story, or causes and effects of events in the story. They place the events and the actions of the characters in a network of conventional causality. Thus they breath real life into the stories and make them relevant to themselves: even though they haven t experienced the events of the story, they might have had similar conventional feelings, motives or character traits, or events in their lives might have had similar conventional causes and effects. Third, the participants decontextualize the stories, for example by using the present tense instead of the past tense of the original story. When the story is decontextualized, the whole story or an aspect of it is made into an example of a type or a category. A character in the story can be made into an example of certain type of a person, an action in the story can be made into an example of a type of an action, words uttered in the story can be generalized so that the group of recipients is understood to be wider than in the original story. A whole event can also be made into an instance of a general type of an event. Thus the story is made relevant to the participants, if they can recognize persons, actions or events belonging to the same type in their own lives, or if they can understand themselves as recipients of words uttered in the story. Fourth, the participants use recontextualizing words and expressions when they talk about the events of the Bible story. These words and expressions are not mentioned in the Bible and they are recognizably foreign to the biblical context. Instead they point to the world of the participants, either to the secular world or the religious world. Thus, while explicitly speaking about the Bible story, they implicitly talk about their own world. In the second phase, when the participants, particularly the teacher, explicitly talk about their own world, they often make use of the ways they have talked about the Bible stories. The clearest examples of this are cases where the participants circulate the same expression when talking about the Bible story and their own world. In one example the teacher has talked about how the identity of the Israelites is lost; later he asks the participants to characterize the identity of their own church. Some sequences where the Bible stories are applied to the life of the participants have been analyzed in more detail. In these instances the teacher asks the participants to talk about their personal experiences in the context of the Bible story. In these sequences the participants answer the questions accordingly and make their experiences similar to the experiences of the biblical characters. They name their experiences according to the Bible story, as interpreted in the teacher s question, they use biblical words and expressions to describe their experiences, and they present themselves in similar roles as the characters of the Bible story. This means also that they make their experiences sharable. In their comments the teachers confirm the sharability of the experience. The participants thus orient to the relevance of the Bible story to them, to the story speaking to them, both when they talk about the Bible story and when they talk about their own lives. They talk about the Bible story in the context of their lives and about their lives in the context of the Bible story. Finding how the Bible can speak to them is a joint accomplishment of the participants. This becomes especially clear in the analysis of question­answer­comment sequences. When the teacher orients to the relevance of the story to the participants in her/his question, the answerer must display her/his understanding of the implications of the question. And in the comment the teacher has a possibility to evaluate the success of the answer. The study brings into focus the use of cultural resources, both by the participants and by the researcher. The use of cultural knowledge is especially recognizable in a context such as the Seventh-day Adventist Bible study that is situated within a partly isolated subculture. The participants draw on many secular cultural resources that can be understood by any member of the Finnish culture, but in some cases understanding the interaction is dependent on knowledge specific to the subculture. It is important to note, however, that cultural resources are used in a situated way. When a participant, for example, answers a question, it is not enough for her/him to produce a culturally right answer, he/she must produce a sequentially right answer. The main aim of the study is to describe the interaction in one specific institutional situation, but it has implications for many other issues. It is an analysis of a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> exegesis, and the results could be of use in discussions between lay people and professional Bible scholars. It is also relevant in discussions about the relationship of text and talk, as the Bible study is an example of a situation where the participants discuss the meaning of a text. It is also a type of a teaching situation, which can be compared with other teaching situations. It is especially interesting to see how the teacher handles the participants experiences. Some sections of the study concern the use of grammatical forms such as particles and adverbs, and the results offer some insights about the relationship between grammar and interaction. And finally, the study invites the possibility of a conversation analytic treatment of various kind of religious practices...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore {{variations}} in <b>lay</b> perceptions <b>of</b> user involvement in clinical governance. CONTEXT: The English National Health Service has sought to build a dependable health service through enhanced effectiveness, responsiveness and consistency. Clinical governance, a policy for improving service quality, is a key pillar of these reforms. It is a statutory duty of primary care organizations to ensure that users are involved in all service planning and decision making, including clinical governance. Yet surveys indicated that user involvement in clinical governance was underdeveloped and underutilized. DESIGN: Focus groups were conducted with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> people to explore their perceptions around public involvement in different aspects of clinical governance policy. RESULTS: Content analysis of the transcripts reveals that different groups <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> people varied in their desired role perspective and preferred <b>type</b> <b>of</b> involvement in different aspects of clinical governance policy. Drawing upon existing models of user involvement, we identified three role perspectives that lay people could take in user involvement - consumer, advocate and citizen. We compared our findings regarding the desired <b>type</b> <b>of</b> involvement with existing models of user involvement, and identified a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> involvement, overseeing, that is relevant to clinical governance policy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that to facilitate user involvement in clinical governance, it would be necessary to use different strategies to accommodate the differing role perspectives and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> involvement desired by different groups <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> people...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of massive investment in antiretroviral access and other AIDS programmes has been the rapid emergence of large numbers <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> workers in the health systems of developing countries. In South Africa, government estimates are 65, 000, mostly HIV/TB care-related lay workers contribute their labour in the public health sector, outnumbering the main front-line primary health care providers and professional nurses. The phenomenon has grown organically and incrementally, playing a wide variety of care-giving, support and advocacy roles. Using South Africa as a case, this paper discusses the different forms, traditions and contradictory orientations taken by lay health work and the system-wide effects <b>of</b> a large <b>lay</b> worker presence. As pressures to regularise and formalise the status <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> health workers grow, important questions are raised as to their place in health systems, and more broadly what they represent as a new intermediary layer between state and citizen. It argues for a research agenda that seeks to better characterise <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> involvement in the health system, particularly in an era of antiretroviral therapy, and which takes a wider perspective on the meanings of this recent re-emergence of an old concept in health systems heavily affected by HIV/AIDS.

40|$|Plants employ various defences {{killing the}} insect {{attacker}} {{in an early}} stage. Oviposition by cabbage white butterflies (Pieris spp.) on brassicaceous plants, including Brassica nigra, induces a hypersensitive response (HR) - like leaf necrosis promoting desiccation of eggs. To gain a deeper insight into the arms race between butterflies and plants, we conducted field and greenhouse experiments using different B. nigra genotypes. We investigated variation in HR and consequent survival of P. brassicae egg clusters. Impact of egg density, distribution type and humidity on HR formation and egg survival was tested. HR differed among plant genotypes as well as plant individuals. Egg density per plant did not affect HR formation. Remarkably, egg survival did {{not depend on the}} formation of HR, unless butterflies were forced to lay single eggs. Larval hatching success from single eggs was lower on plants expressing HR. This may be due to increased vulnerability of single eggs to low humidity conditions at necrotic leaf sites. We conclude that effectiveness of HR-like necrosis in B. nigra varies with plant genotype, plant individual and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> egg <b>laying</b> behaviour (singly or clustered). By clustering eggs, cabbage white butterflies can escape the egg-killing, direct plant defence trait...|$|R

40|$|As a {{doctoral}} student at the London School of Economics, I am researching the 20 th century fortunes of a sub-field of economics: economic history. Broadly speaking, this is a body of knowledge consecrated to understanding the origin, dynamics and consequences of past economic events. In the U. S., shortly after the Second World War, economic history underwent a "revolution. " It was transformed from a relatively eclectic discipline predicated on the reconstruction of an economic past in a predominantly narrative form to a much more uniform field calling upon the rigorous application of economic models and statistical constructs to the past - most of which was expressed in mathematical form 3. To caricature, while an economic historian in the 1940 s would have been concerned with describing the numerous {{ways in which the}} railroad impacted American society and economic growth in the 19 th century, his 1960 s counterpart would have built a mathematical model of the American economy with a railroad, and one without, and measured the economic impact of this change. More than a mere issue of quantification, the difference between these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> scholarship <b>lay</b> in the degree of confidence they gave to theoretical principles developed by economists...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the dynamic analysis of thin-walled composite shells under axial load. analytical and numerical methods {{are used to}} analyze and validate the results with experimental results has been made. In this paper effects of orthotropic of materials, boundary conditions, geometry, geometric imperfections and time course load on the linear and nonlinear analysis of thin-walled composite shells are studied. In the first analyze the sample without to consider geometric imperfections and then the effects of imperfections equal to the actual shell. The critical buckling dynamic is reported in load time that will show the sharp reduction in the buckling load with in increases load time and stiffens of shell is inversely to load time. This effect is more pronounced {{in the case of}} layup. With the increase of load time, the dynamic critical load dropped quickly and smaller than the critical buckling load is static. So in general, the choice of the static critical load is wrong as a criterion for dynamic design. In addition to the static buckling load, dynamic buckling load is reduced with increasing geometric imperfections of sample. Sensitivity to geometric imperfections is dependent on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lay</b> up. The geometric imperfections are the same effect on the dynamic critical load and static critical load for unlimited periods...|$|R
