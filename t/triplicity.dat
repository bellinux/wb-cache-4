Amibousa, a word referring to the phases of the moon, is written under each goddess's feet. Densely inscribed spells frame each goddess: the inscriptions around Dione and Nyche are voces magicae, incantatory syllables ("magic words") that are mostly untranslatable.

2500|$|In {{chapter 3}} Ptolemy unites his {{interests}} in astrology and geography, to outline the astrological associations of [...] "our inhabited world". Maps based on Ptolemy’s Geographica show Ptolemy’s {{definition of the}} inhabited world as (roughly) extending from the equator to latitude 66°N, covering the land mass between the Atlantic Ocean and East China Sea. [...] Ptolemy extends the logic given in ancient Babylonian texts where the four quarters of the known world are attributed to the four <b>triplicity</b> arrangements of the zodiac. [...] The attribution is based on association between the planets that govern the triplicities and the directions and winds those planets are affiliated with. For example, the 'Aries triplicity' (which includes Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) is chiefly dominated by Jupiter and assisted by Mars. Jupiter rules the north wind and Mars the west wind; therefore this <b>triplicity</b> governs the north-west quarter of Ptolemy’s [...] "inhabited world": the area known as Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Georg Hegel distanced his {{philosophy}} from psychology by presenting truth {{as being an}} external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth {{is analogous to the}} mechanics of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. [...] "Truth is its own self-movement within itself." [...] Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of dialectical <b>triplicity</b> toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. Chalybäus used the terms [...] "thesis", [...] "antithesis", and [...] "synthesis" [...] to describe Hegel's dialectical <b>triplicity.</b> [...] The [...] "thesis" [...] consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an [...] "antithesis" [...] occurs which opposes the [...] "thesis." [...] In turn, the [...] "synthesis" [...] appears when the [...] "thesis" [...] and [...] "antithesis" [...] become reconciled and a higher level of truth is obtained. This [...] "synthesis" [...] thereby becomes a [...] "thesis," [...] which will again necessitate an [...] "antithesis," [...] requiring a new [...] "synthesis" [...] until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the Absolute Spirit moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self {{at the very end of}} history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite God.|$|E
2500|$|In astrology, [...] "essential dignity" [...] is the {{strength}} of a planet or point's zodiac position, judged only by its position by sign and degree, what the pre-eminent 17th-century astrologer William Lilly called [...] "{{the strength}}, fortitude or debility of the Planets [...] significators." [...] In other words, essential dignity seeks to view the strengths of a planet or point as though it were isolated from other factors in the sky of the natal chart. Traditionally, there are five dignities: domicile and detriment, exaltation and fall, <b>triplicity,</b> terms, and face. However, the later two have diminished in usage. A planet's domicile is the zodiac sign over which it has rulership.|$|E
50|$|Traditional astrology also organizes <b>triplicities</b> {{according}} to the actual season in which the zodiac rose. For example, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini appear during the spring season.|$|R

50|$|Due to its {{presence}} in insular Celtic art, Celtic Reconstructionists use the triquetra either to represent one of the various <b>triplicities</b> in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky), or {{as a symbol of}} one of the specific Celtic triple goddesses, for example the battle goddess, The Morrígan.|$|R
2500|$|In Egyptian-inspired Greek esoteric {{writings}} {{connected with}} Hermes Trismegistus, and in magical papyri of Late Antiquity she {{is described as}} having three heads: one dog, one serpent, and one horse.

Hecate's <b>triplicity</b> is elsewhere expressed in a more Hellenic fashion in the vast frieze of the great Pergamon Altar, now in Berlin, wherein she is shown with three bodies, {{taking part in the}} battle with the Titans. In the Argolid, near the shrine of the Dioscuri, Pausanias saw the temple of Hecate opposite the sanctuary of Eileithyia; He reported the image to be the work of Scopas, stating further, [...] "This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hecate, were made respectively by Polycleitus and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon."

2500|$|According to British astrologer Alan Leo, Pisces, {{along with}} Scorpio and Cancer, compose the <b>triplicity</b> for water signs. The {{mutability}} {{is key to}} the ever-changing element of water, found in several different forms, much like the transformative aspects found in Christ and Piscean nature. Additionally, these three water signs are considered to be the most fruitful signs, who serve a fertilizing function in nature. He also groups Pisces under the [...] "negative pole;" [...] naturally adept to the astral and psychic worlds. This is resembled in the sign for Pisces (♓), which is composed of two half-circles and a band, signifying the dual nature of man in both the physical world and the unseen realm. According to 20th century astrologer Robert Hand, the fish facing upwards away from the ecliptic is swimming towards the heavens, or is seeking spiritual illumination. The other fish swims along the ecliptic, concerning itself with material matters. The sign modality for Pisces is mutable. It is part of the group of signs, with Gemini, Virgo, and Sagittarius known as the [...] "mutable signs".|$|E
2500|$|Again, these {{divisions}} are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that {{lie to the}} north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards {{the centre of the}} inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions. [...] In this way, the [...] "inhabited region" [...] experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each <b>triplicity</b> and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as [...] "independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also [...] "without passion for women and look down upon the pleasures of love". [...] Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which [...] "for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced [...] "their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness").|$|E
50|$|In Western {{tropical}} astrology, {{there are}} always 12 astrological signs. Each of the four elements is associated with 3 signs of the Zodiac which are always located exactly 120 degrees {{away from each other}} along the ecliptic and said to be in trine with one another. Most modern astrologers use the four classical elements extensively, (also known as <b>triplicities)</b> and indeed it is still viewed as a critical part of interpreting the astrological chart.|$|R

5000|$|In {{traditional}} Western astrology {{there are}} four <b>triplicities</b> based on the classical elements.

This cycle continues on twice more and ends with the twelfth and final astrological sign, Pisces. The elemental rulerships for the twelve astrological signs of the zodiac (according to Marcus Manilius) are summarized as follows: ...|$|R

50|$|As {{successive}} great conjunctions occur nearly 120° apart, their appearances form {{a triangular}} pattern. In a series every fourth conjunction returns after some 60 {{years in the}} vicinity of the first. These returns are observed to be shifted by some 7-8°, so no more than four of them occur in the same zodiacal sign. To each triangular pattern astrologers have ascribed one from the series of four elements and thus four <b>triplicities</b> or 'trigons' are formed. Particular importance has been accorded to the occurrence of a great conjunction in a new trigon, which is bound to happen after some 200 years at most. Even greater importance was attributed to the beginning of a new cycle after all fours trigons had been visited, something which happens in about 800 years. Since each 'element' (trigon) consists of 3 signs it takes 800x3=2400 for the whole process to start anew (relation with the cycle of Precession).Originally a trigon was thought to last 240 years and the full cycle 960 years but later more correct estimation were provided by the Alphonsine tables. Despite the inaccuracies and some disagreement about the beginning of the cycle the belief in the significance of such events generated a stream of publications which grew steadily up to the end of the 16th century. As the great conjunction of 1583 was the last in the watery trigon it was widely supposed to herald apocalyptic changes; a papal bull against divinations was issued in 1586 and as nothing really significant had happened by 1603 with the advent of a new trigon, the public interest rapidly died.|$|R
