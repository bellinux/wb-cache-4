5|$|The family {{continues}} {{to sing and}} more videos are shown. Snake again breaks {{into the house and}} claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a song stuck in his head {{and the only way to}} get rid of it is to kill the Simpsons.

5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer {{to get rid of}} the gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse find it in the refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> rid of the gun.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – {{at the time they}} were not available to buy in England. He would wear the customized boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through countless pairs every season.|$|E

5|$|In the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, Faramir {{is played by}} David Wenham. The actor jokes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses. Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a statement in Unfinished Tales, lacked beards.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{when he was}} nine years old.

Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E

He chases Sunny through the crowd at a cricket stadium where India and Pakistan are playing a {{friendly}} match. Sameer breaks through security, takes the microphone from guest of honour Kapil Dev and apologises to Rani and her parents.

5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.|$|E

Meanwhile, Homer's limousine time has run out, and without any money, he decides to walk home. Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer. After Artie drops Marge off at her house, she returns in her car to pick up Homer, realizing that he was the man for her all along. Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge's dress with the corsage <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall the day <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> married.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Clemens (Charles Dance) is Fury 161's doctor. When Ripley {{crashes into}} the oil sea, he nurses {{her back to}} health and shows her around. Clemens {{performs}} an autopsy on Newt at Ripley's request, although he is annoyed at not being told why. To gain Ripley's trust, Clemens admits <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> drunk after a long shift as a resident and accidentally killed eleven men being treated after a boiler explosion by misprescribing a painkiller. Sentenced to Fiorina 161, he served his time but remained behind with the other inmates when they refused to leave. Ripley still does not reveal {{the true nature of}} the events taking place; as Clemens injects her with a serum, the Alien kills him and drags his body away.|$|E
5|$|Logan informs Veronica {{about the}} sex tape {{of her and}} Piz and hands her a DVD, {{although}} she berates him and denies that the recording is authentic. She views the tape and goes to visit Piz, who is badly bruised. She makes sure that Piz did not upload the footage to the internet, which he confirms. After learning that Logan had attacked Piz, Parker visits Logan's hotel room and tearfully breaks up with him, claiming that he still loves Veronica. Veronica goes to Logan's hotel room and berates him for attacking Piz. She confronts Dick {{about the origins of}} the sex tape, and he reveals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> it from Chip Diller before forwarding it to his whole address book. She investigates further before encountering a student who refuses to tell her anything. She gets Weevil to destroy the student's car, and he names the individual, whom she later wiretaps.|$|E
5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an active part in policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> on with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E

5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Cartman {{learns that}} all KFCs in Colorado have {{been shut down}} because of a new law which bans fast food. After {{receiving}} treatment for KFC withdrawal, Cartman is introduced to Billy Miller, a local boy who runs an illegal KFC cartel from his home. Billy hires Cartman to sell his illegal food, a job that provides Cartman with the same food as payment. After Cartman demonstrates his ruthlessness against a cheating street dealer, Billy sends him and another employee, Tommy, to Corbin, Kentucky to buy chicken directly from Colonel Sanders. Sanders is impressed by Cartman but has Tommy executed after discovering {{him to be a}} mole for healthy foods advocate Jamie Oliver. Cartman wins over the Colonel's trust, but is warned to never betray him. Cartman eventually betrays Billy by telling Billy's mother <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> an F on his social studies test, and takes over the cartel after Billy is grounded. The Colonel assigns Cartman the task of assassinating Oliver to prevent him from giving a speech in the United Nations. However, the gluttonous Cartman soon comes to abuse the KFC food he assigned to sell, and forgets the Colonel's assassination order. The Colonel, furious at Cartman's incompetence, sends a squad of gunmen to kill him, leading to a firefight with the police that kills Billy's mother, and which Cartman escapes unscathed.|$|E

5|$|The 2014 {{season was}} a more {{successful}} season, with the Crusaders making a Grand Final appearance. The Crusaders made the playoffs {{with a record of}} 11 wins and 5 losses. For the second time the Crusaders won the New Zealand Conference, as a result, they earned a first round bye. The Crusaders then defeated the Sharks 38-6 in the semi-final. In the Grand Final against the Waratahs played in Sydney, the Crusaders fell short by 32-33. The Waratahs started strong with a 14-0 early lead before the Crusaders hit back, entering halftime down 13-20. In the 76th minute Colin Slade got his sixth penalty to put the Crusaders up 32-30, looking to steal the game at the end. However, Craig Joubert awarded a controversial penalty in the 78th minute to the Waratahs. Bernard Foley calmly made the championship winning kick, ensuring a 33-32 Waratahs victory. The following day Joubert contacted both Crusaders Coach Todd Blackadder and Crusaders Captain Richie McCaw to apologise, announcing to both <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the final call wrong.|$|E
5|$|While Shekhar {{is off to}} Darjeeling on a {{business}} trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita {{about the loss of}} his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Rilke {{stayed at}} the artists' colony at Worpswede. (Later, his {{portrait}} would be painted by the proto-expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, whom he got to know at Worpswede.)
