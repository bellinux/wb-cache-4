2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a person a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when someone asks a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} season, Richard Woolsey replaces Carter {{as the leader}} of the expedition. Teyla, who was held captive by Michael, gives birth to Torren John and escapes with her team, before they are able to cripple Michael. Eventually, he invades Atlantis with a commandeered Puddle Jumper to take Torren and destroy Atlantis but, thanks to the efforts of Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay, Michael is finally killed. The season also {{introduces}} a group of rogue Asgard, who unlike their Ida counterparts, actually experiment on humans to prolong their lives, and steal a device known as [...] "The Attero device" [...] to destroy the Wraith, though the side effect is that any Stargate activated after the device has been turned on will explode. The device is eventually destroyed. With the Attero device, Michael and the Hoffan drug, the Wraith have become weakened, and are no longer the power of the galaxy they once were; this gives the humans of the Pegasus galaxy freedom enough to establish a coalition. McKay falls in love with Keller, who eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they become romantically involved. In the season finale (also the series finale), [...] "Enemy at the Gate", Todd the Wraith alerts Atlantis to the fact that an underling wraith possesses a Hive Ship powered by a ZPM. [...] In <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to retrieve the ZPM and disable the Hive, the Atlantis team is present when the Hive receives a communication sent from an alternate reality giving away Earth's location.

The Hive ship is then destroyed in the subsequent battle and Atlantis lands in the Pacific Ocean near the Golden Gate Bridge in [...] San Francisco.|$|E

It was verified that the main focus of environmental education in the field is restricted to activities with planting of seedlings for reforestation of degraded areas and conservation of riparian forests. Although, the environmental education may involve several techniques aimed at improving the quality of life in the field. Also, working only with "green marketing" themes are not that interesting, when we talk about sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows that}} one can {{consistently}} incorporate nonunitary representations {{of at least one}} group into the "ordinary" nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This group turns out to be Lorentz group thus giving us an alternative approach to QFT for combining the quantum mechanics and special theory of relativity which keeps the concept of wave function (belonging to some representation of Lorentz group) through the whole theory. Scalar product has been redefined to take into the account the nonunitarity of representations of Lorentz group. Understanding parity symmetry {{turns out to be the}} key ingredient throughout <b>the</b> <b>process.</b> Instead <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to guess an equation or a set of equations for some wave functions or fields (or equivalently trying to guess a Lagrangian for the same), one derives them based only on the superposition principle and properties of wave functions under Lorentz transformations and parity. The resulting model has striking similarities with the standard quantum field theory and yet has no negative energy states, no zitterbewegung effects, symmetric energy momentum tensor and angular momentum density tensor for all representations of Lorentz group (unifying the theoretical description of all particles), as well as clear physical interpretation. It also offers a possible interpretation why particles and antiparticles have opposite quantum numbers. Comment: 47 pages; shortened and clarified, some explanations adde...|$|R
