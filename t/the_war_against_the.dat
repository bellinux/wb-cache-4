5|$|Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva, a cadet who, {{contrary}} to Lasky's beliefs, {{is a full}} supporter of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> insurrectionists. Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence. She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack. Popplewell was new to the Halo series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series {{have the potential to}} draw in a new audience.|$|E

5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular support for <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire {{as part of the}} final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. By that time, however, Hanoi could make no commitment on behalf of its Cambodian allies.|$|E

5|$|Development of the {{military}} settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans {{out of the city}} during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans. He urged the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of military engineering.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not depend on a {{military}} solution in the air or {{on the ground in}} Laos and could only be decided by the outcome in Vietnam, winning <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> DRV in northern Laos was not the objective. Instead, maintaining access to the country was paramount and keeping the Royal Lao government in power became the primary objective.|$|E
5|$|The Song navy was {{of great}} {{importance}} during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Southern Tang state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating pontoon bridges across the Yangtze River {{in order to secure}} movements of troops and supplies. There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks, while the swift-moving paddle-wheel craft were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish army {{surrounded}} Copenhagen, {{hoping to}} starve it into submission. This failed when the Dutch Republic joined the conflict on the Danish {{side and a}} reinforcing fleet managed to smash {{its way through the}} Swedish naval forces in Øresund. Charles then tried a decisive assault on the city, hoping to conquer it and win the war; this plan likewise failed. Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then also joined <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Swedes.|$|E
5|$|The {{parallel}} {{development of}} the anti-monarchist Radomir Rebellion, forced Bulgaria to sign the Armistice of Salonica and withdraw from the war. The treaty included the full capitulation of the 11th Army, bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Central Powers. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect.|$|E

5|$|Æthelwold or Æthelwald (died 902 or 903) was {{the younger}} of two known sons of Æthelred I, King of Wessex from 865 to 871. Because Æthelwold ætheling {{and his brother}} were still infants when their father the king died while {{fighting}} a Danish Viking invasion, the throne passed to the king's younger brother (and Æthelwold's uncle) Alfred the Great, who carried on <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Vikings and won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington in 878.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E

5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, {{who took his}} fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among {{the oldest of the}} 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E
5|$|As Crown Prince Cảnh {{had died}} of {{smallpox}} during <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Tây Sơn, {{it was assumed that}} Cảnh's son would succeed Gia Long, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of Gia Long's second wife, was appointed instead. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deeply conservative aversion to Westerners, whereas Cảnh's lineage had converted to Catholicism and had shunned Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans—especially the French—respectfully, but not to grant them any position of preponderance.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} machinations of Yelü Yixin, {{the only other}} event of note from Emperor Daozong's rule was a war fought between 1092 and 1102 between the Liao and a Mongolian, {{possibly}} Tatar tribe, group known as the Zubu. The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand in that direction. In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao to capture and kill the Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. <b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Zubu was the last successful military campaign waged by the Liao dynasty.|$|E
