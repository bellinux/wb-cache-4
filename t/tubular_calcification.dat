40|$|Chronic {{renal failure}} after nephrotoxic nephritis in rats: Contributions to progression. In rats dietary protein {{restriction}} decreases {{the rate of}} progressive glomerulosclerosis {{and the development of}} renal failure after subtotal nephrectomies. The present experiments were designed to see whether dietary protein had similar effects on renal failure after nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN). Groups of rats were fed isocaloric diets containing 8 %, 18 % and 78 % casein. Irrespective of whether the diets were introduced 7 days or 30 days after induction of nephritis by a single injection of rabbit anti-rat nephrotoxic globulin, rats on 8 % casein and 78 % casein had significantly lower plasma creatinines than rats fed with 18 % casein. Semiquantitative scoring systems were used to assess glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and <b>tubular</b> <b>calcification.</b> Rats on 8 % protein had significantly lower glomerular sclerosis scores than the other two groups. Tubular atrophy scores were similar in rats on 8 % and 78 % casein and significantly lower than those of rats on 18 % casein. All rats on 8 % and 18 % casein diets had <b>tubular</b> <b>calcification</b> whereas rats on 78 % casein did not. This suggested that the normal relation between glomerular sclerosis and tubular atrophy after NTN was altered by a 78 % casein diet. This was confirmed by the slopes of the regression equation for glomerular sclerosis on tubular atrophy (0. 54 ± 0. 07) for rats on 78 % casein compared to the slopes of the regression equations for the other two groups which were 1. 12 ± 0. 10 and 1. 00 ± 0. 12, respectively. This difference is highly significant statistically, P < 0. 1 × 10 - 5; (one-way analysis of variance). These results show that dietary protein has a variable effect on the development of renal failure after nephrotoxic nephritis. They suggest the presence of separate glomerular and tubular contributions to progressive renal failure in this model...|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{patients}} with systemic mycotic infections {{were treated with}} amphotericin B, 1 mg/kg, on alternate days. Five patients also received mannitol (M), 1 g/kg, in the amphotericin infusion, while six served as controls (C). Renal function studies prior to therapy were repeated at a total cumulative amphotericin B dosage of 25 mg/kg; renal biopsies were obtained from 10 patients. Inulin and creatinine clearances decreased in both the C and M groups, significantly so in the latter. Urinary concentrating ability of five patients (2 C, 3 M) decreased as did the capacity of three (1 C, 2 M) to acidify urine after an acid load. Neither the peak and valley levels of amphotericin B in serum nor the urinary excretion thereof differed between the C and M groups. Striking vacuolization of smooth muscle cells, previously unrecognized, was observed in the media of arterioles and arteries in all renal biopsies. <b>Tubular</b> <b>calcification</b> was present in both groups. In summary, M therapy (1 g/kg) did not protect against the nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B. A unique lesion of the renal vasculature secondary to amphotericin B is described...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcute {{and chronic}} renal {{dysfunction}} are common after {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT). Although the pathology of chronic HSCT nephropathy is well described, the histologic changes that accompany acute renal dysfunction after HSCT are less well known because renal biopsies are rarely undertaken in the peritransplantation period. Archival renal tissue from consecutive HSCT recipients who died and underwent autopsy at a single center during an 8 -year period was studied. Abnormalities of renal pathology were described, and associations of histologic abnormalities with clinical events were systemically studied. Abnormalities of renal histology were common among the 26 patients in this study. The 3 most common histologic abnormalities were glomerular sclerosis (19 / 26; 73 %), tubular epithelial atypia (19 / 26; 73 %), and <b>tubular</b> <b>calcification</b> (18 / 26; 69 %). Tubulitis (16 / 24; 67 %) and interstitial fibrosis (16 / 26; 62 %) were also frequently observed. Clinical veno-occlusive disease {{was not associated with}} histologic evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidney at autopsy. Also, clinical graft-versus-host disease was not associated with renal tubulitis. Unexpectedly, the proportion of patients with tubular atrophy (54 %) or interstitial fibrosis (62 %) was high, considering the young age of the patients at transplantation and their normal pretransplantation creatinine clearance. Well-recognized histologic abnormalities are common in the kidneys of patients who die after HSCT. Although we did not demonstrate associations of these histologic changes with clinical variables before death, larger studies with prospectively collected renal tissue are warranted...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVitamin D supplementation {{in humans}} should be {{accompanied}} by calcium administration to avoid bone demineralization through vitamin D receptor signaling. Here we analyzed whether long-term exposure of rats to vitamin D supplementation, {{with or without a}} calcium-rich diet, would promote kidney stone formation. Four groups of rats received vitamin D alone (100, 000 UI/kg/ 3 weeks), a calcium-enriched diet alone, both vitamin D supplementation and calcium-enriched diet, or a standard diet (controls) for 6 months. Serum and urine parameters and crystalluria were monitored. Kidney stones were assessed by 3 -dimensional micro-computed tomography, infrared spectroscopy, von Kossa/Yasue staining, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Although serum calcium levels were similar in the 4 groups, rats receiving vitamin D had a progressive increase in urinary calcium excretion over time, especially those receiving both calcium and vitamin D. However, oral calcium supplementation alone did not increase urinary calcium excretion. At 6 months, rats exposed to both calcium and vitamin D, but not rats exposed to calcium or vitamin D alone, developed significant apatite kidney calcifications (mean volume, 0. 121 mm 3). Thus, coadministration of vitamin D and increased calcium intake had a synergistic role in <b>tubular</b> <b>calcifications</b> or kidney stone formation in this rat model. Hence, one should be cautious about the cumulative risk of kidney stone formation in humans when exposed to both vitamin D supplementation and high calcium intake...|$|R

40|$|Preconditioning of {{the distal}} tubular {{epithelium}} {{of the human}} kidney precedes nephrocalcinosis. BackgroundPreterm neonates and renal transplant patients frequently develop nephrocalcinosis. Experimental studies revealed that crystal retention in the distal nephron, a process {{that may lead to}} nephrocalcinosis, is limited to proliferating/regenerating tubular cells expressing hyaluronan and osteopontin at their luminal surface. Fetal and transplant kidneys contain proliferating and/or regenerating cells since nephrogenesis is not completed until 36 weeks of gestation, while ischemia and nephrotoxic immunosuppressants may lead to injury and repair in renal transplants. This prompted us to investigate the expression of hyaluronan and osteopontin and to correlate this to the appearance of <b>tubular</b> <b>calcifications</b> both in fetal/preterm and transplanted kidneys. MethodsSections of fetal/preterm kidneys and protocol biopsies of transplanted kidneys (12 and 24 weeks posttransplantation from the same patients) were stained for osteopontin, hyaluronan, and calcifications (von Kossa). ResultsHyaluronan and osteopontin were expressed at the luminal surface of the epithelial cells lining the distal tubules of all fetal kidneys at birth and in all kidney graft protocol biopsies 12 and 24 weeks posttransplantation. In 7 out of 18 surviving (at least 4 days) preterm neonates crystal retention developed. In renal allografts a striking increase (from 2 / 10 to 6 / 10) in tubular crystal retention between 12 and 24 weeks posttransplantation was observed. In addition, crystals were selectively retained in distal renal tubules containing cells with hyaluronan and osteopontin at their luminal surface. ConclusionThe results of this study show that luminal expression of hyaluronan and osteopontin preceded renal distal tubular retention of crystals in preterm neonates and renal transplant patients. We propose that the presence of this crystal binding phenotype may play a general role in renal calcification processes...|$|R

40|$|Background: Optic nerve sheath meningioma (ONSM) {{accounts}} for about one-third of all primary optic nerve tumors. The most common clinical manifestation is a slow and progressive loss of vision. Other clinical characteristics include disc edema, optic atrophy, transient visual loss, proptosis, and optociliary shunt vessels. However, without either a high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showing <b>tubular</b> thickening and <b>calcification</b> of the optic nerve or a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a definitive diagnosis cannot be made. As none of these characteristics are pathognomonic of ONSM, {{it is important to}} be able to recognize the different presentations. By doing so, this will assist in the diagnostic process and ultimately, some vision may be preserved. A case report will be presented; differential diagnoses; the major clinical manifestations of ONSM; and treatment modalities will be discussed. Case Report: A 42 -year-old male with a history of intravenous drug abuse, hepatitis C, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with a complaint of a sudden decrease in vision in his left eye for the preceding month. Dilated funduscopy revealed an edematous left optic nerve. Optic neuropathy from demyelinating disease was initially suspected. When the vision continued to decline in spite of cortico-steroid therapy, further testing resulted in the diagnosis of ONSM. Conclusion: Differentiating between ONSM and other etiologies of optic nerve inflammation can be a clinical challenge. Timely diagnosis and treatment may help prevent further vision loss...|$|R
