2500|$|Hobbing machines, {{also known}} as hobbers, are fully {{automated}} machines that come in many sizes, because {{they need to be}} able to produce anything from tiny instrument gears up to [...] diameter marine gears. Each gear hobbing machine typically consists of a chuck and <b>tailstock,</b> to hold the workpiece or a spindle, a spindle on which the hob is mounted, and a drive motor.|$|E
2500|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the <b>tailstock.</b> [...] The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock's spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The <b>tailstock</b> can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is usually}} used to apply {{support to the}} {{longitudinal}} rotary axis of a workpiece being machined. A lathe center is mounted in the <b>tailstock,</b> and inserted against the sides of {{a hole in the}} center of the workpiece. A <b>tailstock</b> has a Dead Center, while headstock has Live Center. A <b>Tailstock</b> is particularly useful when the workpiece is relatively long and slender. Failing to use a <b>tailstock</b> can cause [...] "chatter," [...] where the workpiece bends excessively while being cut.|$|E
50|$|The Morse taper {{was invented}} by Stephen A. Morse in the mid-1860s. Since then, it has evolved to {{encompass}} smaller and larger sizes and has been adopted as a standard by numerous organizations, including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO 296 and the German Institute for Standardization (DIN) as DIN 228-1. It {{is one of the}} most widely used types, and is particularly common on the shank of taper-shank twist drills and machine reamers, in the spindles of industrial drill presses, and in the <b>tailstocks</b> of lathes.|$|R
50|$|Commercial CNC {{metalworking}} machines use {{closed loop}} feedback controls for axis movement. In a closed loop system, the control {{is aware of the}} actual position of the axis at all times. With proper control programming, this will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated in a safe manner. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, spindles, chucks, turrets, tool holders, <b>tailstocks,</b> fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tailstock</b> {{is a tool}} (drill), and centre mount, {{opposite}} the headstock. The spindle (T5) does not rotate but does travel longitudinally under the action of a leadscrew and handwheel (T1). The spindle includes a taper to hold drill bits, centers and other tooling. The <b>tailstock</b> can be positioned along the bed and clamped (T6) in position as dictated by the work piece. There is also provision to offset the <b>tailstock</b> (T4) from the spindles axis, this is useful for turning small tapers, and when re-aligning the <b>tailstock</b> to the axis of the bed.|$|E

50|$|The bed is {{a robust}} base that {{connects to the}} {{headstock}} and permits the carriage and <b>tailstock</b> to be moved parallel with the axis of the spindle. This is facilitated by hardened and ground bedways which restrain the carriage and <b>tailstock</b> in a set track. The carriage travels {{by means of a}} rack and pinion system. The leadscrew of accurate pitch, drives the carriage holding the cutting tool via a gearbox driven from the headstock.|$|E

5000|$|A {{machine tool}} may have several spindles, {{such as the}} {{headstock}} and <b>tailstock</b> spindles on a bench lathe. The main spindle is usually the biggest one. References to [...] "the spindle" [...] without further qualification imply the main spindle. Some machine tools that specialize in high-volume mass production {{have a group of}} 4, 6, or even more main spindles. These are called multispindle machines. For example, gang drills and many screw machines are multispindle machines. Although a bench lathe has more than one spindle (counting the <b>tailstock),</b> it is not called a multispindle machine; it has one main spindle.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tailstock,</b> {{also known}} as a foot stock, is a device often used as part of an {{engineering}} lathe, wood-turning lathe, or used in conjunction with a rotary table on a milling machine.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, if {{converted}} to stepper motor operation, with a CNC milling machine and a <b>tailstock,</b> a rotary table allows many parts {{to be made}} on a mill that otherwise would require a lathe.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the entire}} <b>tailstock</b> is {{moved to the}} {{approximate}} position {{that it will be}} needed by manually sliding it along its ways. There, it is locked in place and the tool mounted to it is moved with a leadscrew to the exact position where it is needed. When a cutting tool such as a drill bit or reamer is used, the feed is done with this leadscrew. The <b>tailstock</b> quill or extendible portion usually has a Morse taper mount in the end of it to secure the drill or reamer. If the work is heavy the drill may be further secured from turning with a lathe dog as shown in the photo.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of tapers was to mount drill bits {{directly}} to machine tools, {{such as in the}} <b>tailstock</b> of a lathe, although later drill chucks were invented that mounted to machine tools and in turn held non-tapered drill bits.|$|E
5000|$|Tapered turning : a) {{from the}} {{compound}} slide b) from taper turning attachment c) using a hydraulic copy attachment d) using a C.N.C. lathe e) using a form tool f) by the offsetting of the <b>tailstock</b> - this method more suited for shallow tapers.|$|E
50|$|The wood rotates {{between the}} {{headstock}} of the lathe {{which includes the}} drive mechanism and the <b>tailstock</b> support, which only rotates if its center is 'live' or supported by a rotating holding device. The headstock end may use points or spurs which are driven into the wood. This type of turning is described as 'between centers.' The headstock spindle may also use a cup, collet, or a scroll chuck to hold a tenon on the workpiece which will be removed in the finished product. The wood can also be screwed or glued to a faceplate—a strong disk that is threaded to mount on the headstock's spindle. The use of a chuck or faceplate allows the woodturner to forego <b>tailstock</b> support for the rotating wood. This type of secure holding system is essential for hollowing bowls or hollow forms.|$|E
50|$|The {{workpiece}} {{is held in}} the {{indexing head}} {{in the same manner}} as a metalworking lathe. This is most commonly a chuck but can include a collet fitted directly into the spindle on the indexing head, faceplate, or between centers. If the part is long then it may be supported with the help of an accompanying <b>tailstock.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>tailstock</b> {{was also}} of {{completely}} new design. The quill could be fed by three different methods: Rapidly {{by a large}} starwheel, by worm reduction via a smaller handwheel, or automatically by geared connection to the saddle. The transverse adjustment of the centre was done by an eccentric mechanism. The centre was protected from overload by a spring arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret lathes (bench lathes, engine lathes, toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the toolpost, <b>tailstock,</b> or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a turret lathe's, and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a turret lathe's turret does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|E
50|$|Hobbing machines, {{also known}} as hobbers, are fully {{automated}} machines that come in many sizes, because {{they need to be}} able to produce anything from tiny instrument gears up to 10 ft diameter marine gears. Each gear hobbing machine typically consists of a chuck and <b>tailstock,</b> to hold the workpiece or a spindle, a spindle on which the hob is mounted, and a drive motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} lathes can vary greatly {{depending}} on the intended application; however, basic features are common to most types. These machines consist of (at the least) a headstock, bed, carriage, and <b>tailstock.</b> Better machines are solidly constructed with broad bearing surfaces (slide-ways) for stability, and manufactured with great precision. This helps ensure the components manufactured on the machines can meet the required tolerances and repeatability.|$|E
50|$|For light loads (such as {{encountered}} by a lathe <b>tailstock</b> or a drill press), tools with self-holding tapers are simply slipped onto {{or into the}} spindle; {{the pressure of the}} spindle against the workpiece drives the tapered shank tightly into the tapered hole. The friction across the entire surface area of the interface provides a large amount of torque transmission, so that splines or keys are not required.|$|E
50|$|A chuck is a {{specialized}} type of clamp. It {{is used to}} hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylinder. In drills and mills it holds the rotating tool whereas in lathes it holds the rotating workpiece. On a lathe the chuck is mounted on the spindle which rotates within the headstock. For some purposes (such as drilling) an additional chuck may be mounted on the non-rotating <b>tailstock.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Rotary {{tables are}} most {{commonly}} mounted [...] "flat", with the table rotating around a vertical axis, {{in the same}} plane as the cutter of a vertical milling machine. An alternate setup is to mount the rotary table on its end (or mount it [...] "flat" [...] on a 90° angle plate), so that it rotates about a horizontal axis. In this configuration a <b>tailstock</b> can also be used, thus holding the workpiece [...] "between centers." ...|$|E
50|$|Lathes {{have four}} main {{components:}} the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the <b>tailstock.</b> The bed is a precise & very strong base {{which all of}} the other components rest upon for alignment.

The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The <b>tailstock</b> can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary.

50|$|On 1st June 2016, a dead Minke whale washed ashore on the West Sands beach of St. Andrews, {{near to the}} SMRU, and was {{discovered}} by a dog walker that evening. During low-tide on the 2nd June, staff and students from the SMRU, along with the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme, jointly conducted a necropsy of the whale {{in view of the}} public. Noting signature abrasions on the <b>tailstock,</b> and excessive fluid in the lungs, they concluded that the animal had been caught in a fishing trawler's lines, and was drowned by the dragging.|$|E
5000|$|The Morse taper {{allows the}} bit to be mounted {{directly}} into the spindle of a drill, lathe <b>tailstock,</b> or (with the use of adapters) into the spindle of milling machines. It is a self-locking (or self holding) taper of approximately 5/8" [...] per foot that allows the torque {{to be transferred to}} the drill bit by the friction between the taper shank and the socket. The tang {{at the end of the}} taper is only for ejecting the drill bit from the spindle, with the aid of a drift.|$|E
50|$|While in Sawbridgeworth, Cosby married Josephine Collins, the {{daughter}} of a local doctor. In the 1920s Cosby was frustrated by poor quality lathes available and resolved to produce his own design for a cheap but effective production lathe with pneumatically actuated headstock and <b>tailstock</b> and its own electric drive. In 1929 he was trading as Smallpeice Ltd, and moved the company to Foleshill Rd, Coventry where he shared premises with Cromwell Engineering. The collaboration allowed the production in 1929 of the Smallpeice Multicut production lathe. There was also a precision lathe marketed under the Cromwell name, and Smallpeice continued in the development of pneumatic aids to production, and apart from premises in Mile Lane in Coventry he had a drawing office in the village of Marton.|$|E
50|$|The {{counterpoint}} to the headstock is the <b>tailstock,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} the loose head, as it can be positioned at any convenient point on the bed by sliding it to the required area. The tail-stock contains a barrel, which does not rotate, but can slide in and out parallel to the axis of the bed and directly in line with the headstock spindle. The barrel is hollow and usually contains a taper to facilitate the gripping of various types of tooling. Its most common uses are to hold a hardened steel center, which is used to support long thin shafts while turning, or to hold drill bits for drilling axial holes in the work piece. Many other uses are possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{spinning}} process is fairly simple. A formed block is {{mounted in the}} drive section of a lathe. A pre-sized metal disk is then clamped against the block by a pressure pad, which {{is attached to the}} <b>tailstock.</b> The block and workpiece are then rotated together at high speeds. A localized force is then applied to the workpiece to cause it to flow over the block. The force is usually applied via various levered tools. Simple workpieces are just removed from the block, but more complex shapes may require a multi-piece block. Extremely complex shapes can be spun over ice forms, which then melt away after spinning. Because the final diameter of the workpiece is always less than the starting diameter, the workpiece must thicken, elongate radially, or buckle circumferentially.|$|E
5000|$|Horizontal {{boring mill}} Large, {{accurate}} bed horizontal mills that incorporate many features from various machine tools. They are predominantly {{used to create}} large manufacturing jigs, or to modify large, high precision parts. They have a spindle stroke of several (usually between four and six) feet, and many are equipped with a <b>tailstock</b> to perform very long boring operations without losing accuracy as the bore increases in depth. A typical bed has X and Y travel, and is between three and four feet square with a rotary table or a larger rectangle without a table. The pendant usually provides between four and eight feet of vertical movement. Some mills have a large (30" [...] or more) integral facing head. Right angle rotary tables and vertical milling attachments are available for further flexibility.|$|E
50|$|A {{revolving}} center, {{also known}} as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or <b>tailstock</b> end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel - it moves therefore is live.|$|E
