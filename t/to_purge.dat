5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and oxidizer systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{near the}} end of Jagiełło's life, Poland was governed in {{practice}} by an oligarchy of magnates led by Bishop Oleśnicki. The rule of the dignitaries was actively opposed by various groups of szlachta. Their leader Spytek of Melsztyn was killed at the Battle of Grotniki in 1439, which allowed Oleśnicki <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> Poland of the remaining Hussite sympathizers and pursue his other objectives without significant opposition.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior agents were fired or quit.

5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{can also help}} detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of a}} hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E

5000|$|In {{political}} ideology, a deviationist is {{a person}} who expresses a deviation: an abnormality or departure. In [...] Stalinist ideology and practice, deviationism is an expressed belief which does not accord with official party doctrine for the time and area. Accusations of deviationism often led <b>to</b> <b>purges.</b> Forms of deviationism included revisionism, dogmatism, bourgeois nationalism, and rootless cosmopolitanism.|$|R
5000|$|In brief, Due <b>to</b> <b>purging,</b> {{inbreeding}} depression is not {{proportional to the}} standard measure of inbreeding (Wright's inbreeding coefficient [...] ), since this measure only applies to neutral alleles. Instead, fitness decline is proportional to [...] "purged inbreeding" [...] , which gives the probability of being homozygous for deleterious alleles due to inbreeding, taking into account how they are being purged.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "purge" [...] is {{sometimes}} used for selection against deleterious alleles {{in a general}} way. It would avoid ambiguity to use [...] "purifying selection" [...] in that general context, and <b>to</b> reserve <b>purging</b> <b>to</b> its more strict meaning defined above.|$|R

5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and more hard line Protesters who wished <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|Using the Supersemar letter, Suharto {{ordered the}} banning of PKI the {{following}} day, and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint a new cabinet consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the MPRS (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each services.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the moderating effects of body dissatisfaction (BD) on {{the relationships between}} various constructs of control and weight restricting and control behaviours (WRCBs). Participants were 167 female undergraduates who completed self-report measures of control, BD and WRCBs. It was found that higher {{external locus of control}} (LOC) was related to less dieting and exercise and that LOC was unrelated <b>to</b> <b>purging.</b> In addition, higher levels of general self-control were found to be related to higher levels of purging when BD was high but not low, and higher general self-control was associated with greater dieting and exercise behaviour. Finally, higher 2 ̆ 7 self-control as self-esteem 2 ̆ 7 was strongly associated with greater dieting and exercise behaviour at both high and low levels of BD, whilst 2 ̆ 7 self-control as self-esteem 2 ̆ 7 was related <b>to</b> <b>purging</b> only when BD was high. The results of this research suggest that different constructs of control have differential effects on WRCBs. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was split on whether <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists {{who wanted to}} distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
5|$|After the {{execution}} of the King in January 1649, England was declared a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied the country in 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E

Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E
