As children, the characters such as Mulan demonstrates {{the positive aspects}} of never giving up, not being restricted to gender roles and <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> and honor. These aspects of the film are more in keeping with a traditional Chinese perspective on cultural value, such as <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> and honor. Featured on the official Disney Princess website, the character's brief biography reads, [...] "Mulan is a loving girl who is always brave and bold. When her country needs it most, she disguises herself as a man and goes off to fight. She uses courage and determination to win the day." [...] Interestingly, Mulan is currently the only official member of the Disney Princess franchise who is technically not a legitimate princess [...] "in the traditional sense," [...] as she was neither born the daughter of a king or queen nor does she become princess consort by marrying a prince. Additionally, she is also the franchise's first and currently only East Asian member.|$|E

500|$|According to scholar Carol E. Neubauer, {{the themes}} in the poem in And Still I Rise, {{as the title of}} the volume suggests, focus on a hopeful {{determination}} to rise above difficulty and discouragement. Neubauer states, [...] "These poems are inspired and spoken by a confident voice of strength that recognizes its own power and will no longer be pushed into passivity". [...] Angelou focuses on the same themes as her previous volumes, including love, loneliness, and Southern racism, but with the added twist of the nature of women and <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family.</b> They cover a wider range of topics, including springtime, aging, sexual awakening, drug addiction, and Christian salvation.|$|E
500|$|Angelou uses two {{distinct}} voices, the adult writer {{and the child}} who {{is the focus of}} the book, whom Angelou calls [...] "the Maya character". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is [...] "damned difficult", but [...] "very necessary". Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou [...] "retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain" [...] by using her adult self's irony and wit. [...] As such, Caged Bird has been called a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story; critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to other Bildungsromans like George Eliot's novel The Mill on the Floss. According to Lupton, the two books share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers, an examination of the role of literature in life, and an emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> and community life.|$|E

Such policy explicitly acknowledges <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>families</b> in "making <b>the</b> strategy happen" (p. 19), by parents providing young people with "clear and accurate information, and encouragement to make responsible decisions" (p. 20).

His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as [...] "Wil"). In later life Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> {{to the point of}} claustrophobia for those around her.

40|$|BACKGROUND The intergenerational {{transmission}} of fertility has received much attention in demography. This {{has been done}} by estimating the correlation between parents' and offsprings' fertility. An alternative method that provides a more comprehensive account of the role <b>of</b> <b>family</b> background - sibling correlations - has not been used before. OBJECTIVE I estimate <b>the</b> overall <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> background on entry into parenthood and completed fertility and whether it changed over time. Furthermore, I compare the intergenerational correlation in completed fertility with corresponding sibling correlations. METHODS Brother and sister correlations in first birth hazard and in final family size were estimated using multi-level event-history and multi-level linear regression on Swedish longitudinal register data. RESULTS The overall variation in fertility that can be explained by <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin is approximately 15 Š- 25 Š for women and 10 Š- 15 Š for men. <b>The</b> overall <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin has not changed over the approximately twenty birth cohorts that were studied (1940 - 63 for women, 1940 - 58 for men). Parents' completed fertility accounts for only a small share <b>of</b> the total <b>family</b> background effect on completed fertility. CONCLUSIONS This study contributes to the existing understanding of intergenerational transition of fertility, both methodologically, by introducing a new and powerful method to study <b>the</b> overall <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin, and substantially, by estimating <b>the</b> overall <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin and ist development over time. A non-negligible proportion of the variation in fertility can be attributed to <b>family</b> <b>of</b> origin and this effect has remained stable over twenty birth cohorts...|$|R
