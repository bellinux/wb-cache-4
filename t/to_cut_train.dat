30|$|We finally present {{separate}} effects by skill groups. The {{results show}} that the effect is mostly driven by a reduction of training for medium and highly qualified employees. While this is at odds with predictions by Lechthaler and Snower (2008), it could well be that employers cannot further risk a diminishing productivity of low-skilled employees, and in contrast, they are able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>training</b> costs of employees that are typically not concerned by minimum wages.|$|R
30|$|We analyze {{effects of}} the {{introduction}} of the new statutory minimum wage on firm-level training in Germany. Human capital theory predicts that binding minimum wages prohibit wage cuts that are used by employers to finance training. If training costs are not offset by an increase in productivity, firms have <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>training</b> costs. However, this pessimistic prediction can be relaxed when labor market frictions allow for productivity-dependent rents (Acemoglu and Pischke 2003). Moreover, an increase of relative demand for skilled workers may induce an incentive for human capital accumulation.|$|R

30|$|When we {{estimate}} separate effects for rather competitive and non-competitive sectors, {{we find that}} the negative effects on the training intensity are driven by competitive sectors, whereas the effect in non-competitive sectors remains inconclusive. This effect heterogeneity corroborates predictions by Acemoglu and Pischke (2003) who have shown that market frictions and productivity-dependent rents can, in fact, allow for a positive effect of minimum wages on training. We also demonstrate that the minimum wage mostly affected employer-financed training but not training that is at least partially financed by employees. We conclude that employers have a minimum wage induced incentive <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>training</b> costs when they cannot devise improved training regimes that would provide net productivity increases. The employees’ incentives for human capital accumulation seem to be unchanged.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{regional}} {{case study of}} the effects of training on labour market adjustment following mass layoffs in a single-industry mining community, Elliot Lake in Northern Ontario.

This is not a call <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> funding for <b>training,</b> which can have important social and psychological benefits for laid-off workers and their families; but it is a criticism of the current approach that makes training the principal focus of adjustment policy, at least as it plays out in single-industry communities like Elliot Lake. ...|$|R

30|$|There is no magical {{formula to}} address labor market segmentation, with fiscal, {{economic}} and political circumstances significantly limiting room for maneuvre. Member states should nonetheless continue to carefully modernize labor law and welfare states, {{even if it is}} only possible in an incremental way. Radical deregulation of permanent contracts or re-regulating of temporary contracts should be avoided. Policy-makers should also resist the temptation <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> ALMPs and <b>training</b> programs in particular. Given its favorable long-term consequences, training programs targeted at the most needy should be an important pillar in any strategy to address segmentation. Member states should continue to experiment with fiscal incentives to convert temporary into permanent contracts, while carefully evaluating the schemes and making their survival conditional upon success. Finally, it will be important to move towards a better social protection of temporary workers. For economic and symbolic reasons, employers will have to make a relevant contribution to this. Austria, France and Italy exemplify different approaches that could be developed into more broadly applicable strategies to address segmentation.|$|R

40|$|Human capital theory {{suggests}} that workers may finance on-the-job training by accepting lower wages during the training period. Minimum wage laws could reduce job training, then, {{to the extent they}} prevent low-wage workers from offering sufficient wage <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> finance <b>training.</b> Empirical findings on the relationship between minimum wages and job training have failed to reach a consensus. Previous research has relied primarily on survey data from individual workers, which typically lack both detailed measures of job training and important information about the characteristics of firms. This study addresses the issue of minimum wages and on-the-job training with a unique employer survey. We find no evidence indicating that minimum wages reduce the average hours of training of trained employees, and little to suggest that minimum wages reduce the percentage of workers receiving training.

The first serious examination of the long term viability of the railway came with the Howden Report in 1949, which recommended {{the closure of the}} Ramsey line, which was already losing money; the eventual closure of the Peel line, which was breaking even in the late 1940s; and the retention of the then profitable Port Erin line. Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10-25 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track maintenance, and <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>train</b> mileage as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960-61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M.
