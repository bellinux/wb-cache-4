5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European Fireball Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The fireball subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the fireball did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. <b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} matrix {{can be seen}} as {{a precursor}} to the fundamental matrix. Both matrices can be used for establishing constraints between matching image points, but the essential matrix can only be used in relation to calibrated cameras since the inner camera parameters must be known in order to achieve the normalization. If, however, the cameras are calibrated the essential matrix can be useful for determining both the relative position and orientation between <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> the 3D position of corresponding image points.|$|E

25|$|Writer Colin Brake {{suggested}} that 1989 {{was a year}} of big change for EastEnders, both behind <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> in front of them.

Producer Mike Gibbon was given the task of running the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and Tony McHale.|$|E
25|$|The housemates are taped {{around the}} clock.

In total, approximately 30 cameras are used during production. Each member of the cast is instructed to ignore <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> the crew, but are required to wear a battery pack and microphone in order to record their dialogue, though some castmembers have been known to turn off or hide them at times. The only area of the house in which camera access is restricted are the bathrooms.|$|E

25|$|The mining {{companies}} that owned {{the road where}} the first season was filmed felt the show portrayed the road in a negative fashion. They believed the show depicted drivers as cowboys making a mad dash for money and taking excessive risks to do so. Also, the companies felt <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> filming created distractions for the drivers. As a result, the owners decided {{not to participate in}} future seasons of the show, and a new rule for the Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Roads was enacted for the 2008 season, prohibiting commercial, media, video, or rolling film cameras either inside or attached to the outside of vehicles. In response, the show's producers located an alternate ice road for season 2.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{idea for}} {{realising}} K9 {{was to use}} a small actor inside a robotic Dobermann costume, but that was rejected in favour of a radio-controlled prop, designed by Tony Harding and made by the BBC Visual Effects Department. The Radio Control Model Centre in Harlington Middx owned by Derek Wales was commissioned to build the electronics into the first original basic shell and consequently the centre operated the dog on set for the BBC. The robot suffered from numerous technical problems during its time in the series, often malfunctioning because the radio controls interfered with <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. On location, K9 also proved unable to traverse uneven terrain, and shots had to be conceived with this in mind. Workarounds included using a concealed piece of twine to pull the character along (this string can be clearly seen in a shot of K9 on Brighton Beach), or laying wooden planks on which it could roll.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{over time}} <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> {{recording}} media for fluoroscopic imaging have progressed as follows. The original kind of fluoroscopy, {{and the common}} kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use digital image processing and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).|$|E

25|$|Placing {{the flash}} away from <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> optical axis {{ensures that the}} light from the flash hits the eye at an oblique angle. The light enters the eye in a {{direction}} away from the optical axis of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> is refocused by the eye lens back along the same axis.

25|$|Lighting {{designer}} Al Gurdon {{worked with}} Stufish and Tait Towers {{for the light}} setup, which was handled by PRG Group. The three main video screens were angled to give the side audience a better angle of vision. A Hippotizer V3 media server was used for content playback and operated by PRG Nocturne's Will Stinson, and five cameras were manned for this show. PRG used their newly invented GroundControl followspot devices which were attached as truss {{to the top of}} the screens, using Clay Paky Stormy Strobes. Fitted with high-definition cameras, they could be operated from backstage, who could simply use <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> direct the lights to illumate specific areas as required, without having to have knowledge about the physical stage. Console director Joshua Hutchings controlled their color, beams and shutters. Advantage of the followspot was to allow the lightning personnel to operate from a comfortable environment, rather than to climb on heights atop the stage. Hutchings explained the whole show was time-coded, going inline with the choreography.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in September 2013, the LAPD {{started a}} trial {{program for the}} use of body worn cameras with 30 {{officers}} in the Skid Row area. Reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement. In November 2014 in a sign of body camera purchases to come, the department chose Taser International as the vendor for body cameras to be used by the LAPD after their use in the trial program earlier in the year. On December 16, 2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7,000 body worn cameras from Taser for use by the department. Patrol officers will be equipped with the cameras which will be purchased in the next fiscal year in order to outfit all patrol officers by the expected completion date in June 2016. 700 of the cameras will first be deployed to patrol officers in the Central, Mission and Newton patrol areas of the city beginning in January 2015. $1.55 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another $1 million coming from the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Department of Justice. In total, the body cameras will most likely cost less than $10 million and will be included in Garcetti's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget. Before all of the cameras are deployed to patrol officers, the Police Commission will create a policy that governs the use of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras. While the commission has not created a policy yet as of December 2014, several guidelines were already outlined by the Mayor including that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation, but many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded. The cameras may also be turned off in situations where police use deadly force. Prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras, officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices starting in 1994 if they file an application and obtain the requisite permission.|$|E
500|$|Questions {{were also}} raised over where the {{footage of the}} event came from, and {{the speed with which}} camera crews {{appeared}} on scene. Chinese government media reported that the close-up shots in its video footage came from confiscated CNN tapes. CNN representatives argued that this was impossible, however, as their reporters were detained shortly after the event began. Pan was also suspicious of the positioning of <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>and</b> the fact that the close-up shots shown on Chinese television were taken without police interference. [...] "In some, the camera is clearly behind police barricades", the Washington Post article says. In addition, overhead surveillance camera footage seemed to show a man filming the scene using a small hand-held camera, rather than a large camera of the type used for TV news reporting.|$|E
