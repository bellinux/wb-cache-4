5|$|Unlike the White House Hanukkah Party, Obama's White House Passover Seder {{was not a}} {{political}} event. The guest list did not include rabbinical figures, Jewish lobbyists, members of Congress, or Israeli representatives. The guest list of approximately 20 remained basically the same each year. Attendees included <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family, members of the president's and first lady's staff and their families, {{and friends of the}} Obamas, with a mix of Jews and non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|During the Diệm era, the VNQDD were {{implicated in}} two failed coup attempts. In November 1960, a paratrooper revolt failed after the mutineers agreed to negotiate, {{allowing}} time for loyalists {{to relieve the}} president. Many of the officers involved had links to or {{were members of the}} VNQDD, and fled the country after the coup collapsed. In 1963, VNQDD leaders Tam and Vũ Hồng Khanh were among those arrested for their involvement in the plot; Tam committed suicide before the case started, and Khanh was jailed. In February 1962, two Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguyễn Văn Cừson of a prominent VNQDD leaderand Phạm Phú Quốc, bombarded the Independence Palace in a bid to kill <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family, but their targets escaped unharmed. Diem was eventually deposed in a military coup and killed in November 1963. While the generals that led the coup were not members of the VNQDD, they sought to cultivate ARVN officers who were part of the VNQDD because of their antipathy towards Diem.|$|E
5|$|Apparently {{poised for}} a {{military}} victory, the rebels hesitated. Đông wanted to storm the palace and capture <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family. Thi felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, he was South Vietnam's best available leader and thus was worried Diệm could be killed in an attack. Thi thought that enforced reform was the best outcome. The rebels wanted Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief advisor, and his wife, Madame Nhu, who were {{widely regarded as the}} powers behind Diệm's rule, out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to assassinate or deport the couple. Thi demanded that Diệm appoint an officer as Prime Minister and remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorized by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed for corruption and suppression of liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent representatives to negotiate. After lengthy talks, the parties agreed to a ceasefire. In the meantime, loyalist forces headed towards the capital. Diệm promised to end press censorship, liberalize the economy, and hold free and fair elections. Diệm refused to sack Nhu, but agreed to dissolve the cabinet and form a new government which would accommodate members of the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of 12 November, Diệm taped a speech detailing the concessions, and Thi broadcast the message on Saigon Radio.|$|E
