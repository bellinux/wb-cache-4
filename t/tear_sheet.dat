40|$|After the {{interface}} debonding, the body protein fluid is subsequently pumped into stem-cement fretting wear interface, {{serving as the}} lubricant. On the stem surface, whether there is the influence of protein absorption on fretting wear or not is considered in this study. The biotribological properties at the stem-cement interface were investigated by SEM. The result of hysteresis loops shows that elasticity and plasticity performance of the frictional interface materials can be damaged by fretting fatigue and material energy dissipation will increase periodically. The wear quantity of cement is mainly influenced by load and displacement. The maximum wear loss of bone cement could reach 1. 997 [*]mg. Bone cement and titanium alloy wear debris, whose size distributions are widely spread from 1 to 110 [*]μm and 5 to 150 [*]μm, respectively, are shaped like tuber, <b>tear,</b> <b>sheet,</b> strip, and sphere, which will induce the osteocyte damage...|$|E
