5000|$|The <b>Trustee</b> Savings <b>Bank</b> (TSB) was a British {{financial}} institution. <b>Trustee</b> savings <b>banks</b> originated {{to accept}} savings deposits from those with moderate means. Their shares were not {{traded on the}} stock market but, unlike with mutually held building societies, depositors had no voting rights; nor did they have the power to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organisation. Directors were appointed as trustees (hence the name) on a voluntary basis. The first <b>trustee</b> savings <b>bank</b> was established by Reverend Henry Duncan of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire for his poorest parishoners in 1810 with its sole purpose being to serve the local people in the community [...] Between 1970 and 1985, the various <b>trustee</b> savings <b>banks</b> in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into a single institution named TSB Group plc, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, the TSB merged with Lloyds Bank to form Lloyds TSB, at that point the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest (to HSBC, which had taken over the Midland Bank in 1992) by market capitalisation.|$|R

The transfer had not been achieved without public controversy and acrimony but has now been settled beyond recall. The <b>Trustees</b> Savings <b>Bank</b> Central Board subsequently through an Offer for Sale sold shares in the TSB Group pic to the general public. After providing for free shares to qualifying employees, making allowance for loyalty bonus shares and after setting aside some £ 86 m for the expenses of the issue, the offer for sale will raise an estimated £. 1, 274 m for the TSB Group plc when the shares are fully paid in September 1987. The offer for sale was heavily advertised and highly successful in that it was over-subscribed eight times and applications had either to be scaled down substantially or rejected. After the initial allotment the TSB Group plc had 3. 1 m shareholders; 1. 3 m customers and employees and 1. 8 m others, mainly individual shareolders as international demand was largely unmet. The shares rose to a substantial premium suggesting that the issue had been underpriced and with an unnecessary underwriting expense.
