50|$|Independent {{adoption}} is slightly different {{and a bit}} less bureaucratic. It is not <b>required</b> <b>that</b> the <b>adoptive</b> parents have a pre-placement home study (unless the {{adoption is}} interstate). The {{theory is that the}} birth mother is directly selecting the adoptive parents, rather than relinquishing that decision to an agency. The birth mother (and sometimes the birth father) personally select the adoptive parents, usually by being shown photo-resumes of waiting adoptive parents, then meeting some families in person to select the chosen family. As with agency adoption, a six-month home study follows. In most counties, the home study is done by the California Department of Social Services. In some counties, however, a county office performs the service. Regardless, the home study fee is the same (see below).|$|R
25|$|Cohabitating {{partners}} have no parental rights over {{the children of}} the other partner. It is possible, however, for one partner to legally adopt the other’s biological children. The adoptive parent must not be legally incapacitated, must not have been stripped of his or her parental rights by the courts, and must be at least 16 years older than the adopted child. It is not possible for co-habitating couples to adopt orphans, since the law <b>requires</b> <b>adoptive</b> couples to be married.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an agency}} adoption, the agency must be {{licensed}} by the State of California. The California State Department of Social Services offers a website with a listing of licensed agencies. Caution must be exercised that the entity is indeed a licensed agency and not a business using a name which implies it is an agency. California permits [...] "facilitators" [...] to assist in adoptions (businesses not licensed to perform home studies or take relinquishments or do legal work, but permitted {{to aid in the}} process in other ways). Agency adoption first <b>requires</b> <b>that</b> the <b>adoptive</b> parent have a home study completed prior to the placement of a child. The agency then takes the relinquishment of the birth mother (and father if available). For six months following the adoptive placement, the agency supervises the placement, and then can write to the court to approve the adoption. In a typical home study, the adoptive parents are fingerprinted (run through the child abuse registry and criminal index), provide letters of reference, provide proof of marriage if married (although singles may adopt), complete a health and social history, and demonstrate a preparedness to provide a loving home. A court can then grant the adoption in a simple court hearing in which both adoptive parents and the child appear.|$|R
40|$|Transnational {{adoption}} <b>requires</b> <b>adoptive</b> {{parents to}} negotiate complexities concerning difference and belonging within the family. Transnational adoption is mediated through societal and governmental prescriptions of suitability that include willingness and competency {{to raise children}} to maintain connections to their birth heritages. Tensions {{in the formation of}} parental identities are located in different racial, ethnic, cultural and class-based backgrounds to the children they adopt. This contrasts against dominant models of family where constructions of belonging are based on biological ties. A qualitative study of thirty-five Australian adoptive parents explored reflections on adoption processes and how the complex task of performing suitability was negotiated. Theoretical understandings were developed using a grounded theory approach. Contemporary social theory with a focus on race, cosmopolitanism and families further developed emergent theoretical understandings during analysis. Tensions in identity formation are discussed. The paper concludes that issues of race in identity formation are marginalised. No Full Tex...|$|R
25|$|Induced lactation, {{also called}} adoptive lactation, {{is the process}} of {{starting}} breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually <b>requires</b> the <b>adoptive</b> mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that built community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds.|$|R
