5|$|For whole numbers {{less than}} a <b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> (< 109) the two scales are identical. From a <b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> up (≥ 109) the two scales diverge, using the same words for {{different}} numbers; this can cause misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} into the expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about a billion (one <b>thousand</b> <b>million)</b> kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The word, milliard, or its translation, {{is found}} in many European {{languages}} and is used in those languages for 109. However, it is unknown in American English, which uses billion, and not used in British English, which preferred to use <b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> before the current usage of billion. The financial term, yard, which derives from milliard, is used on financial markets, as, unlike the term, billion, it is internationally unambiguous and phonetically distinct from million. Likewise, many long scale countries use the word billiard (or similar) for one thousand long scale billions (i.e., 1015), and the word trilliard (or similar) for one thousand long scale trillions (i.e., 1021), etc.|$|E

The rules for this de {{are the same as}} those described above: it is used when the last two digits of the number of <b>thousands,</b> <b>millions,</b> etc. are 00 or 20-99.

Some sources give an unreasonably young age of 1.88 Ma, which is likely a misquotation– the discovery paper mentions that the bedrock in the region (known as the Central Finland Granite Complex) formed about 1.88 Ga (<b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> years ago), in the late Paleoproterozoic era.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there were}} plans to issue ten (new-style) billion (1010) pengő notes (similar in design to the 1946-version 10 Ft note), {{denominations}} higher than one billion were renamed milpengő (which stands for million pengő) and the indicated value was reduced {{by a factor}} of one million. The next denomination after the one billion pengő note became the 10000 milpengő, which was equal to ten <b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> pengő, and had a similar design to the 10000 pengő note. The aim was to ease everyday money handling and accounting as well as to reuse the designs of earlier banknotes with little changes.|$|E

Although the amount is small, about 10 parts in a <b>thousand</b> <b>million,</b> it has excited scientists to question its source. Since methane {{is removed from}} the Martian atmosphere very rapidly, there must be a current source that replenishes it. Because one of the possible sources could be microbial life, it is planned to verify the reliability of these data and especially watch for difference in the concentration in various places on Mars. It is hoped that the source of this gas can be discovered by finding its location of release.|$|E
5|$|Every {{new term}} greater than <b>million</b> is one <b>thousand</b> {{times larger than}} the {{previous}} term. Thus, billion means a <b>thousand</b> <b>millions</b> (109), trillion means a thousandbillions (1012), and so on. Thus, an n-illion equals 103n+3.|$|R

500|$|The {{scabrous}} lyrics—"God {{save the}} Queen/She ain't no human being/There is no future/In England's dreaming"—prompted widespread outcry. Several major chains refused to stock the single. It was banned {{not only by}} the BBC but also by every independent radio station, making it the [...] "most heavily censored record in British history". That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two <b>thousand</b> <b>million</b> years." [...] Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see how anyone could describe us as a political band.

The international root biliono is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix -iliono to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix -iliardo: ...|$|E

In the last ten years, Romania had paid 12 <b>thousands</b> <b>millions</b> dollars, which implied great sacrifice and restraints of the food and energy supplied to population. The Communist propaganda presented this event as a great success of the „genuine” of Ceausescu’s politics. It had been organized many demonstrations to mark „the economic independence” of the country. In reality, Ceaușescu was the main person responsible for the debts crisis.
