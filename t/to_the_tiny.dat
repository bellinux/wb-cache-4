5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only {{a single pair of}} legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{would return}} to France six more times {{over the course of}} the next twelve years. Her {{frequent}} visits and excellent reputation made her the cause célèbre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of Petit Beurre cookies in 1916. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny,</b> remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} pittas {{are found in}} South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus Pitta is the most widespread. The two species found in Africa are from this clade, as are the most northerly species (the fairy pitta) and the most southerly (the noisy pitta). The most remote insular endemics are in this group as well, including the black-faced pitta, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The pittas of the clade Erythropitta are mostly found in Asia with one species, the Papuan pitta, reaching the north of Australia. The Hydrornis pittas are exclusively Asian. Some pittas have large distributions, like the hooded pitta, which ranges from Nepal to New Guinea, others have much smaller ones, like the superb pitta, which is endemic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> island of Manus in the Admiralty Islands.|$|E
25|$|North of the Zambezi, the Portuguese claims, {{were opposed}} {{both by the}} African Lakes Company and the missionaries.

However, it did not accept an expansion of Portuguese influence, and in 1889 it appointed Henry Hamilton Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, and instructed him {{to report on the}} extent of Portuguese rule in the Zambezi and Shire valleys. He was also to make conditional treaties with local rulers outside Portuguese control. These conditional treaties did not establish a British protectorate, but prevented the rulers from accepting protection from another state.|$|E

25|$|The New Zealand wrens are endemic and {{restricted}} to the main and offshore islands of New Zealand; {{they have not been}} found on any of the outer islands such as the Chathams or the Kermadec Islands. Prior to the arrival of humans in New Zealand (about 1280 AD), they had a widespread distribution across the North and South Islands and on Stewart Island/Rakiura. The range of the rifleman and bushwren included southern beech forest and podocarp-broadleaf forest, with the range of the bushwren also including coastal forest and scrub, particularly the Stewart Island subspecies. The New Zealand rock wren is specialised for the alpine environment, in areas of low scrub and scree from 900 m up to 2,400 m. Contrary to its other common name (the South Island wren), fossil evidence shows it was more widespread in the past and once lived on the North Island. Lyall's wren was once thought to have been restricted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> Stephens Island in Cook Strait, but fossil evidence has shown the species was once widespread on both the North and South Islands. The stout-legged wren was similarly found on both islands, but fossils of the long-billed wren have only been found on the South Island. Fossils of the long-billed wren are far less common than those of the other species, in fact, its bones are the rarest fossil finds in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, {{university}} and college attendance before the 1960s, including {{for the period}} of Portuguese monarchy which ended in 1910, and for most of the Estado Novo regime (1920s - 1974), was very limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> elites, like members of the bourgeoisie and high ranked political and military authorities. In addition, there were few institutions of higher education, low levels of secondary education attainment, and a high illiteracy rate for Western European standards. However, during {{the last decade of the}} Estado Novo regime, from the 1960s to the 1974 Carnation Revolution, secondary and university education experienced the fastest growth of Portuguese education's history. Today higher education, which includes polytechnic institutions and university institutions, is generalized but very heterogeneous, with different tonalities and subsystems. Overcrowded classrooms, obsolete curricula, unequal competition among institutions, frequent rule changing in the sector and increasingly higher tuition fees (inside the public higher education system, although much smaller than private institution fees) that can be a financial burden for many students, have been a reality until the present day, though some improvements have been made since the Bologna Process implementation in 2007/2008. The Bologna Process created a more uniform and homogeneous higher educational system, at least within the public {{university and}} polytechnical institutions. Nearly 40% of the higher education students do not finish their degrees, although an undisclosed number of those students are subsequently readmitted into other courses or institutions of their choice. Despite their problems, many good institutions have a long tradition of excellence in teaching and research, where students and professors can attain their highest academic ambitions.|$|E
25|$|Also {{under the}} Piapro brand is Crypton's Piapro Studio, a Vocaloid vocal editor {{implemented}} as a VST/AU plugin bundled {{with all of}} their full V3 Vocaloid products (Miku V3, Miku V3 English, Miku V3 Bundle, Meiko V3, Kaito V3). This allows for full vocal editing functionality nearly identical in feature support to Yamaha's full Vocaloid 3 Editor software, which is available as either a standalone application or a plugin for Cubase. All Vocaloid 3 voice libraries include the Tiny Vocaloid 3 Editor for free, however this is quite severely limited in functionality compared to the full V3 editor, being limited to just 17 bars of output, along with some other limitations - serving mainly as a beginner's taste of Vocaloid editing or a way to easily test out a new vocal library. Piapro Studio was created to allow owners of Crypton's V3 products to have a fully featured vocal editor with a modernized and streamlined interface bundled free of charge. It also allows for the loading of 3rd-party, non-Crypton Vocaloid 3 voicebanks - as well as V2's that have been imported into the full V3 editor beforehand. Being a VST plugin, it allows the user to operate entirely within their DAW of choice, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tiny</b> or full V3 editors which are standalone applications and the user must export a wav to import into their DAW each time a change or update is needed - or export an updated wav file from their DAW as the background music to import into the V3 editor. This integration of the vocal editing within the DAW as a VST instrument plugin allows for convenient editing and a smoother workflow. Currently Piapro Studio is lacking some features of the full V3 editor, {{but most of these}} are not needed to work with the vocal composition and tuning of the Vocaloid, instead currently some convenience and expansion features such as WAV import and Vocaloid 3's Job Plugins (a scripting system), are absent from Piapro Studio. Crypton has however has mentioned they would like to implement something similar to Job Plugins {{at some point in the}} future. Piapro Studio is also regularly updated every few months with new features and bug fixes. Vocaloid 3 Editor updates appear much less frequently, generally only around the time of release of a new Vocaloid. Piapro Studio also features some Piapro social designed singer icons and vocal preview samples, added in an update in the Summer of 2014.|$|E
