5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and <b>telomerase,</b> which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. <b>Telomerase</b> is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses {{replicate}} their genomes by reverse transcribing DNA copies {{from their}} RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. Retrotransposons also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another, and <b>telomerase</b> contains an RNA {{that is used}} as template for building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme <b>telomerase,</b> as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> activity: Telomerases are {{necessary}} to sustain cell division unrestricted by the Hayflick limit of ~50 cell divisions. hESCs express high <b>telomerase</b> activity to sustain self-renewal and proliferation, and iPSCs also demonstrate high <b>telomerase</b> activity and express hTERT (human <b>telomerase</b> reverse transcriptase), a necessary component in the <b>telomerase</b> protein complex.|$|E
25|$|The role of telomeres and <b>telomerase</b> in cell {{aging and}} cancer was {{established}} by scientists at biotechnology company Geron with the cloning of the RNA and catalytic components of human <b>telomerase</b> {{and the development of}} a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay for <b>telomerase</b> activity called the TRAP assay, which surveys <b>telomerase</b> activity in multiple types of cancer.|$|E
25|$|The end {{replication}} {{problem is}} handled in eukaryotic cells by telomere regions and <b>telomerase.</b> Telomeres extend the 3' {{end of the}} parental chromosome beyond the 5' end of the daughter strand. This single-stranded DNA structure can act as an origin of replication that recruits <b>telomerase.</b> <b>Telomerase</b> is a specialized DNA polymerase that consists of multiple protein subunits and an RNA component. The RNA component of <b>telomerase</b> anneals to the single stranded 3' end of the template DNA and contains 1.5 copies of the telomeric sequence. <b>Telomerase</b> contains a protein subunit that is a reverse transcriptase called <b>telomerase</b> reverse transcriptase or TERT. TERT synthesizes DNA {{until the end of}} the template <b>telomerase</b> RNA and then disengages. This process can be repeated as many times as needed with the extension of the 3' end of the parental DNA molecule. This 3' addition provides a template for extension of the 5' end of the daughter strand by lagging strand DNA synthesis. Regulation of <b>telomerase</b> activity is handled by telomere-binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|Some {{experiments}} have raised questions on whether <b>telomerase</b> {{can be used}} as an anti-aging therapy, namely, the fact that mice with elevated levels of <b>telomerase</b> have higher cancer incidence and hence do not live longer. <b>Telomerase</b> also favors tumorogenesis, which leads to questions about its potential as an anti-aging therapy. On the other hand, one study showed that activating <b>telomerase</b> in cancer-resistant mice by overexpressing its catalytic subunit extended lifespan.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} {{maintain}} functional telomeres may be one mechanism that allows cancer cells to grow in vitro for decades. <b>Telomerase</b> activity is necessary to preserve many cancer types and is inactive in somatic cells, creating the possibility that <b>telomerase</b> inhibition could selectively repress cancer cell growth with minimal side effects. If a drug can inhibit <b>telomerase</b> in cancer cells, the telomeres of successive generations will progressively shorten, limiting tumor growth.|$|E
25|$|A {{trial of}} GRNVAC1, a <b>telomerase</b> vaccine being used on {{patients}} {{with prostate cancer}} was carried out at Duke University. Geron's progress with <b>telomerase</b> vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} express <b>telomerase,</b> which {{allows them to}} divide {{repeatedly}} and form the individual. In adults, <b>telomerase</b> is highly expressed only in cells that need to divide regularly especially in male sperm cells but also in epidermal cells, in activated T cell and B cell lymphocytes, {{as well as in}} certain adult stem cells, but in the great majority of cases somatic cells do not express <b>telomerase.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2009, it {{was shown}} {{that the amount of}} <b>telomerase</b> {{activity}} significantly increased following psychological stress. Across the sample of patients <b>telomerase</b> activity in increased peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 18% one hour {{after the end of the}} stress.|$|E
25|$|Because most {{malignant}} cells rely on {{the activity}} of the protein <b>telomerase</b> for their immortality, it has been proposed that a drug that inactivates <b>telomerase</b> might be effective against a broad spectrum of malignancies. At the same time, most healthy tissues in the body express little if any <b>telomerase,</b> and would function normally in its absence. Currently, inositol hexaphosphate, which is available over-the-counter, is undergoing testing in cancer research due to its telomerase-inhibiting abilities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> {{is often}} {{activated}} in cancer cells to enable cancer cells to duplicate their genomes indefinitely without losing important protein-coding DNA sequence. Activation of <b>telomerase</b> {{could be part}} of the process that allows cancer cells to become immortal. The immortalizing factor of cancer via telomere lengthening due to <b>telomerase</b> has been proven to occur in 90% of all carcinogenic tumors in vivo with the remaining 10% using an alternative telomere maintenance route called ALT or Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres.|$|E
25|$|The lack of <b>telomerase</b> {{does not}} affect cell growth, until the telomeres are short enough to cause cells to “die or undergo growth arrest”. However, {{inhibiting}} <b>telomerase</b> alone {{is not enough to}} destroy large tumors. It must be combined with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> can {{bind the}} first few {{nucleotides}} of the template to the last telomere sequence on the chromosome, add a new telomere repeat (5'-GGTTAG-3') sequence, let go, realign the new 3'-end of telomere to the template, and repeat the process. <b>Telomerase</b> reverses telomere shortening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> reverse {{transcriptase}} that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{research}} groups have experimented {{with the use}} of <b>telomerase</b> inhibitors in animal models, and as of 2005 and 2006 phase I and II human clinical trials are underway. Geron Corporation is currently conducting two clinical trials involving <b>telomerase</b> inhibitors. One uses a vaccine (GRNVAC1) and the other uses a lipidated oligonucleotide (GRN163L).|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> is {{a reverse}} {{transcriptase}} enzyme that carries its own RNA molecule (e.g., with the sequence 3′-CCCAAUCCC-5′ in Trypanosoma brucei) {{which is used}} as a template when it elongates telomeres. (Beyond unicellular organisms) <b>Telomerase</b> is active in normal stem cells and most cancer cells, but is normally absent from, or at very low levels in, most somatic cells.|$|E
25|$|Other {{attempts}} to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction {{of research has}} been research into {{the possibility of using}} the enzyme <b>telomerase</b> in order to counter the process of telomere shortening. However, there are potential dangers in this, since some research has also linked <b>telomerase</b> to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>telomerase</b> {{vaccines}} {{have been}} developed: GRNVAC1 and GV1001. GRNVAC1 isolates dendritic cells and the RNA that codes for the <b>telomerase</b> protein {{and puts them}} back into the patient to make cytotoxic T cells that kill the telomerase-active cells. GV1001 is a peptide from the active site of hTERT and is recognized by the immune system that reacts by killing the telomerase-active cells.|$|E
25|$|In normal circumstances, absent <b>telomerase,</b> if a cell divides recursively, at {{some point}} the progeny reach their Hayflick limit, which is {{believed}} to be between 50–70 cell divisions. At the limit the cells become senescent and cell division stops. <b>Telomerase</b> allows each offspring to replace the lost bit of DNA allowing the cell line to divide without ever reaching the limit. This same unbounded growth is a feature of cancerous growth.|$|E
25|$|A {{study that}} focused on Ashkenazi Jews found that {{long-lived}} subjects inherited a hyperactive version of <b>telomerase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Approaches to {{controlling}} <b>telomerase</b> and telomeres {{for cancer}} therapy include gene therapy, immunotherapy, small-molecule and signal pathway inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|E6 {{has also}} been shown to target other {{cellular}} proteins, thereby altering several metabolic pathways. One such target is NFX1-91, which normally represses production of <b>telomerase,</b> a protein that allows cells to divide an unlimited number of times. When NFX1-91 is degraded by E6, <b>telomerase</b> levels increase, inactivating a major mechanism keeping cell growth in check. Additionally, E6 can act as a transcriptional cofactor—specifically, a transcription activator—when interacting with the cellular transcription factor, E2F1/DP1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> - Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostak {{discover}} {{enzyme that}} promotes cell division and growth 1985.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> replaces short bits of DNA {{known as}} telomeres, which are {{otherwise}} shortened when a cell divides via mitosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> {{deficiency}} {{has been}} linked to diabetes mellitus and impaired insulin secretion in mice, due to loss of pancreatic insulin-producing cells.|$|E
25|$|Geron {{originally}} investigated <b>telomerase</b> as a {{means of}} understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.|$|E
25|$|Geron Corporation is a {{biotechnology}} company {{located in}} Menlo Park, California, {{which specializes in}} developing and commercializng therapeutic products for cancer that inhibit <b>telomerase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that lobsters may not slow down, weaken or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters {{may be more}} fertile than younger lobsters. This longevity {{may be due to}} <b>telomerase,</b> an enzyme that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. <b>Telomerase</b> is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages, but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike most vertebrates, lobsters express <b>telomerase</b> as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Lobster longevity is limited by their size. Moulting requires metabolic energy and the larger the lobster, the more energy is needed; 10 to 15% of lobsters die of exhaustion during moulting, while in older lobsters, moulting ceases and the exoskeleton degrades or collapses entirely leading to death.|$|E
25|$|With <b>telomerase</b> {{activation}} {{some types}} of cells and their offspring become immortal (bypass the Hayflick limit), thus avoiding cell death {{as long as the}} conditions for their duplication are met. Many cancer cells are considered 'immortal' because <b>telomerase</b> activity allows them to live much longer than any other somatic cell, which, combined with uncontrollable cell proliferation is why they can form tumors. A good example of immortal cancer cells is HeLa cells, which have been used in laboratories as a model cell line since 1951.|$|E
25|$|Their {{longevity}} {{may be due}} to <b>telomerase,</b> {{an enzyme}} that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. <b>Telomerase</b> is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express <b>telomerase</b> as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. Lobsters grow by moulting which requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required. Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die. The European lobster has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.|$|E
25|$|Exposure of T {{lymphocytes}} from HIV-infected human {{donors to}} a small molecule <b>telomerase</b> activator (TAT2) retards telomere shortening, increases proliferative potential and enhances cytokine/chemokine production and antiviral activity.|$|E
25|$|Carol Greider and the Australian born Elizabeth Blackburn, {{along with}} Jack W. Szostak, {{received}} the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for {{the discovery of}} how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme <b>telomerase.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Telomerase</b> in the ciliate Tetrahymena was {{discovered}} by Carol W. Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984. Together with Jack W. Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the harmful}} cancer-related effects of <b>telomerase</b> are {{dependent}} on an intact RNA template. Cancer stem cells that use an alternative method of telomere maintenance are still killed when telomerase's RNA template is blocked or damaged.|$|E
