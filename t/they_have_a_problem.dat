25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E
25|$|Drift diving {{occurs when}} the divers allow {{themselves}} to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} in general practitioners' participation in promoting health, {{little is known about}} the attitudes of their patients. Thus we sent a copy of a self administered questionnaire (the Health Survey Questionnaire) to 3452 patients aged 17 - 70 who were registered with two practices in north west London. Questions about attitudes to and perceptions of general practitioners' interest in weight, smoking, drinking, and fitness problems were included. The patients were also asked whether they thought that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in any of these areas. The response rate was 72 %. Of those who responded, the proportions who thought that their general practitioners should be interested ranged from 72 % in the case of fitness to 83 % for weight, but only 38 % thought that general practitioners had in fact been interested in fitness and only 48 % thought so about weight. Forty one per cent of the respondents thought that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fitness <b>problem,</b> 42 % <b>a</b> weight <b>problem,</b> and 59 % of the smokers thought that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> smoking <b>problem.</b> Four per cent of respondents stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> drinking <b>problem.</b> Of those patients who said that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> the proportions who thought that their general practitioners had seemed interested ranged from 43 % for fitness to 69 % for smoking. The findings of this study suggest that greater participation by general practitioners in health promotion would be well received by most patients and that currently there may be considerable discrepancies between patients' expectations and their perception of their general practitioner's interest in these areas of preventive medicine...|$|R

Brocklebank told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Ivan tells the men that if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> they should take it out on him, not his boyfriend. This is the first time Ivan [...] "actually vocalises it" [...] and he is shocked because [...] "he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before". Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not ready to come out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E

50|$|Acceptance: With {{substance}} abusers, admitting {{the existence}} of a problem is different from accepting the problem. When a substance abuser admits that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> this is more likely to occur in the bargaining stage. Accepting that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> is when you realise that you have a problem and start the process to resolve the issue.|$|E
