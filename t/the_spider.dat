5|$|In 1985, {{after losing}} and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was {{scheduled}} to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as <b>The</b> <b>Spider.</b> During the match, <b>The</b> <b>Spider</b> broke from the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's shoulders to the mat. The referee—who was in on the plan—delivered a swift three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack <b>the</b> <b>Spider,</b> unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise.|$|E
5|$|The Linyphiidae {{generally}} make horizontal but uneven sheets, with tangles {{of stopping}} threads above. Insects {{that hit the}} stopping threads fall onto the sheet or are shaken onto it by <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> and are held by sticky threads on the sheet until <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> can attack from below.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of extant spider species are included in this group. The exceptions belong to the infraorder Mygalomorphae, which includes tarantulas, trapdoor spiders and several families of funnel-web <b>spiders,</b> and <b>the</b> suborder Mesothelae, which includes about 100 species living in Asia. The Araneomorphae include <b>the</b> orb-weaver <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> cobweb <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> crab <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> jumping <b>spiders,</b> <b>the</b> wolf <b>spiders,</b> and <b>the</b> large huntsman <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> half-pipe, <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> are {{captured}} and Dash signals Johnny, who blows <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> up. Professor Marks, {{who had been}} opposed to killing <b>the</b> <b>spiders,</b> charges at Dash and tries to kill him. Marks falls {{down the side of}} the half-pipe to <b>the</b> last <b>spider,</b> which kills him as Baker shoots the beast.|$|R
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E
5|$|Characters and {{elements}} from the series have inspired scientific names of several organisms, including the dinosaur Dracorex hogwartsia, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> Eriovixia gryffindori, the wasp Ampulex dementor, and the crab Harryplax severus.|$|E

5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse spider. In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's MythBusters, it was shown that host Adam Savage survived a bite from <b>the</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|E
5|$|For moulting, all Portias spin a {{horizontal}} web whose diameter is {{about twice the}} spider's body length and is suspended only 1 to 4millimetres below a leaf. <b>The</b> <b>spider</b> lies head down, and often slides down 20 to 30millimetres during moulting. Portias spin a similar temporary web for resting.|$|E
5|$|In African mythology, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> is personified as a {{creation}} deity Anansi, {{and as a}} trickster character in African traditional folklore. There are many variations of the name including Kwaku Ananse of the Ashanti in West Africa(his original name) and anglicized as Aunt Nancy (or Sister Nancy) in the West Indies and some {{other parts of the}} Americas.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> was {{associated}} with the goddess Neith in her aspect as spinner and weaver of destiny, this link continuing later through the Babylonian Ishtar and the Greek Arachne, who was later equated as the Roman goddess Minerva.|$|E
5|$|Many horror {{films have}} {{featured}} <b>the</b> <b>spider,</b> including 1955's Tarantula, exploiting America's fear of atomic radiation during the nuclear arms race, the 1975 low-budget cult film The Giant Spider Invasion, and Kingdom of the Spiders, a 1977 film starring William Shatner, depicting {{the consequence of}} hungry spiders deprived of their natural food supply due to pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Spiders are {{depicted}} in Indigenous Australian art, in rock and bark paintings, and for clan totems. Spiders in their webs {{are associated with}} a sacred rock in central Arnhem Land on the Burnungku clan estate of the Rembarrnga/Kyne people. Their totem design is connected with a major regional ceremony, providing a connection with neighboring clans also having spider totems in their rituals. Nareau, the Lord Spider, created the universe, according to the traditional Cosmology of Oceania's Kiribati islanders of the Tungaru archipelago (Gilbert Islands); similarly, Areop-Enap ("Old Spider") plays an important part in the creation myth of the traditional Nauru islanders of Micronesia. In the Philippines, there is a Visayan folk tale version of <b>The</b> <b>Spider</b> and the Fly which explains why <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> hates the fly.|$|E

50|$|Even if <b>the</b> tiger <b>spider</b> {{is famous}} for preying on <b>the</b> recluse <b>spider,</b> University of Chile's {{studies have shown that}} only 50% of {{encounters}} between the two kinds of spider result in a fight between them, out of which only 75% result in <b>the</b> tiger <b>spider</b> actually killing <b>the</b> recluse <b>spider.</b> <b>The</b> title of natural predator of <b>the</b> recluse <b>spider</b> is therefore open to doubt.|$|R

5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering their web and plucking its silk threads until <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which spiders treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E
5|$|Spiders {{have been}} present for many decades both in film and on television, {{predominantly}} in the horror genre. Those who suffer from arachnophobia, an acute fear of spiders, become particularly horrified. <b>The</b> <b>spider</b> web {{is used as a}} motif to adorn dark passageways, depicting the recesses of the unknown.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two weapons {{new to the}} Metroid series: the tri-splitting Spazer Laser Beam, and the Plasma Beam, which {{passes through}} enemies when shot. Samus can only equip one beam at a time; however, she can switch between them by returning to where they are first found. Metroid II features the Space Jump, a new suit enhancement that allows Samus to jump infinitely and access otherwise unreachable areas. The game also sees the return of Samus' Morph Ball, a mode in which she curls up into a ball to travel through small tunnels. In addition, the game {{is the first in}} the series to feature <b>the</b> <b>Spider</b> Ball and Spring Ball. <b>The</b> <b>Spider</b> Ball allows Samus to climb most walls or ceilings, giving her freedom to explore both the surfaces and ceilings of caverns, and the Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while curled up into a ball in the Morph Ball form.|$|E
25|$|Predators {{of adult}} Ae. albopictus in Malaysia include various spider species. Up to 90% of <b>the</b> {{gathered}} <b>spiders</b> from rubber plantations and a cemetery fed upon Asian tiger mosquitoes. Whether <b>the</b> <b>spiders</b> {{would have an}} effect on the mosquito population is still unclear. Tiger mosquitoes were abundantly present despite the existence of <b>the</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R

5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders can move {{downwards}} faster than upwards. If {{there is an}} obvious direction in which <b>the</b> <b>spider</b> can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spider</b> Heteropoda davidbowie {{is named}} in his honour and, {{following}} his death on 10 January, Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden {{announced that the}} first animal born in 2016 - a blue penguin chick - would be named Bowie after the late singer.|$|E
5|$|The third sequel Spider-Man: 1602 {{centers on}} the {{continuing}} adventures of <b>the</b> <b>Spider</b> and features reinterpretations of Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, and Mary Jane Watson. Also appearing are the Beast, Janet and Henry Pym, the Kingpin (reimaged as a pirate named King's Pin), Bullseye (reimaged as an assassin and first mate of the King's Pin), and Steve Rogers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> ornate <b>spider</b> monkey (Ateles geoffroyi ornatus), is a {{subspecies}} of Geoffroy's spider monkey, {{a type of}} New World monkey, from Central America, {{native to}} Costa Rica and Panama.
