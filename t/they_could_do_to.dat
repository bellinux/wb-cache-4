5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there was nothing more <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prevent it.|$|E
5|$|That {{same day}} British {{forces in the}} Mediterranean carried out Churchill's orders by attacking Ottoman {{shipping}} off of the port of İzmir. That night at an Ottoman Cabinet meeting, the Grand Vizier's anti-war faction was forced to accept that the Empire was at war, {{and that there was}} little <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> avoid conflict. The Russians declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914. Admiral Andrei Eberhardt immediately ordered Russia's fleet to retaliate against the Ottomans for the raid. On 4 November, a Russian task force bombarded Zonguldak.|$|E

60|$|It did. They {{started with}} {{breaking}} a cup. That {{was the first}} thing they did. They <b>did</b> that just <b>to</b> show you what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>to</b> get you interested.|$|R
5|$|On November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen {{to destroy}} a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal {{officers}} and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers had done all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter.|$|E
5|$|While the British {{remained}} firmly against separate Rhodesian {{representation in}} Lisbon, {{there was little}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> stop it. Ross was nominally put on extended leave, but not withdrawn. Deciding that {{he could no longer}} wait for Bottomley to fulfil his promise to visit Rhodesia during October, Smith resolved to instead meet with Wilson personally in London, and arranged to travel on 3 October, arriving the next day. While Smith prepared to travel, Britain continued its frantic efforts to carry international anti-Rhodesian sentiment, among other things urging each NATO member government not to deal with Reedman. In London, Britons who sympathised with Smith came out to support him in large numbers, surprising both the British and the Rhodesians. The two Prime Ministers' talks were largely unproductive, and little common ground was found before Smith flew home on 12 October.|$|E
5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E
60|$|To {{be fair to}} Kaiser Bill {{the other}} pups were not much better. Trailer and Big Foot were young still, and about all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> run and howl.|$|R
50|$|Curiously though, the Florentine {{reserves}} under Ischia stood {{their ground}} against Hawkwood's terrible onslaught. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> {{turn the tide}} of battle since the Hawkwood's men were all heavily armed, whilst the peasants were not.|$|R
60|$|Antigonus Gonatas was now {{quite the}} most {{powerful}} person left in Macedon or Greece, and though Sparta and Athens {{tried to get the}} help of Egypt against him, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> shake off his power.|$|R
25|$|The organising {{committee}} paid {{special attention}} to the after effects of the games on London, and what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make sure the games left a lasting impression on London and the world. The LOCOG planned out the uses of important stadiums and transportation systems after the games, as well as the social factors of the 2012 legacy.|$|E
25|$|After a {{controversial}} race in Hockenheim, 2010 {{lead to the}} ban on team orders being dropped. When Ferrari asked Felipe Massa to move over to allow their No.1 driver; Fernando Alonso into {{the lead of the}} race and take the win - they were fined $100,000. The FIA decided that the rule was too vague, and there was nothing <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> enforce it.|$|E
25|$|The {{workplace}} regulations {{also brought}} in {{a new form of}} enforcement of the legislation. Under the Fire Precautions Act, Section 10 gave the fire brigade the power to close a premises if there was serious danger from fire; however, there was very little <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> bring a premises up to standard. Section 4 of the Fire Precautions Act did give some limited powers to issue a 'Notice of Steps' to be taken to correct any defects.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since I {{would not}} have their {{assistance}} {{to get hold of}} the Chink and recover my property, the least <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> send me their servant. It was Jones who said that, and Ricardo backed up the idea.|$|R
5000|$|The avvisi were {{blamed for}} causing {{disputes}} by church officials and writers. However, institutions that condemned avvisi found <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> quell the hand-written newsletters {{and began to}} use them to their own benefit, even with bans still in place.|$|R

25|$|The spell, {{intended}} to last only seconds and function {{only within the}} new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal gameplay, as players did what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), it lasted until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally controlled the spread.|$|E
25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned Forest Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> save it, a development Profous had been hoping for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{decided to}} stretch the envelope", Falk said. [...] "Instead of calling up the {{companies}} and asking them how much they would pay Michael Jordan, we called them up {{and asked them to}} make a presentation and explain what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> promote him. Needless to say, this got a lot of quizzical replies." [...] Unbeknownst to Falk and Jordan, Nike had decided to target Jordan as their player of the future. [...] Jordan himself was initially reticent; throughout college he had worn Converse because of the company's endorsement deal with Tar Heels coach Dean Smith, and off the court, he wore Adidas. [...] Jordan had never worn or even seen a Nike shoe before the company contacted him.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> make {{themselves}} comfortable, {{and so had}} to simply grin and bear it, which they did with the best grace possible. They were afraid to remain under the trees for fear of getting struck by some falling branch.|$|R

60|$|George was in {{good hands}} now, and since <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> aid him, Ralph beckoned to Bob to leave the room, for he was anxious to learn what was {{contained}} in the paper, and wished that some one should share the secret with him.|$|R
2500|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of [...] "eleventh hour resistors" [...] {{towards the end of}} the war, as in other countries. The Islanders had been bypassed by the war, they were tired and very hungry during the winter of 1944-5, they knew there was little <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help the war effort, so patiently awaited the liberation. Each arrival of the SS Vega gave brief opportunities to celebrate. During April 1945 British flags started to appear, and the public was warned not to aggravate the Germans. The true feelings of Islanders burst out into the open on 9 May 1945 when they were ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Pirates!' he cried. The others {{came closer}} to him. A strange smile was playing about his face, and Wendy {{saw it and}} shuddered.

60|$|Bob was by {{no means}} easy in his mind when he left Mr. Hillman and George to begin his rounds of the outposts; but he was {{determined}} that, since all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> hold possession, no one not legally entitled to it should gain admittance to the place.|$|R
