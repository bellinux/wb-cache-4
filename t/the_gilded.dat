30|$|<b>The</b> <b>gilding</b> {{created by}} {{traditional}} methods was fragile [33, 34]. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>gilding</b> {{should not be}} frequently cleaned. Additionally, excessive heat and light should be avoided, and extreme care should be taken when installing light and heat sources near <b>the</b> <b>gilding</b> surfaces to avoid creating localised areas of damage. All of these effects {{have contributed to the}} different alterations that were observed in the studied medallions.|$|R

5|$|A {{handful of}} {{rooms in the}} modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design {{originates}} from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal of some of <b>the</b> <b>gilded</b> features on the pilasters. Anthony Salvin's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi. The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
40|$|The artistic {{versatility}} of <b>the</b> <b>gilding</b> {{masters of}} <b>the</b> baroque period in Lisbon is fully documented {{on the work}} contracts and accounting books of the many brotherhoods, religious orders and other commissioners. As professionals like woodcarvers, masons and tile makers, <b>the</b> <b>gilding</b> masters were elected by the contractors to compose artistic programs that {{had to deal with}} the baroque notion of bel composto. Sometimes commissions reported to <b>the</b> <b>gilding</b> of <b>the</b> woodcarved altarpieces, the painting of areas of the altar that were meant to imitate other materials, like stone and painting ceilings and other areas. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>gilding</b> of <b>the</b> woodcarved altars, these professionals were often asked to "encarnar" and "estofar" the major images of the Virgin, Christ, saints, angels and putti and some of them also executed oil paintings for the main altars and other places of the churches, like the naves or vestries of the temples...|$|R

5|$|In 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, {{and was a}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> Age New York {{literary}} {{scene for}} the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, news reached New York that Congress {{had voted}} for {{independence}} four days earlier. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons {{of the city}} to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they tore down <b>the</b> <b>gilded</b> lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain. In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, and mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, {{and the rest of the}} statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.|$|E
5|$|The Bone Wars, {{also known}} as the Great Dinosaur Rush, was a period of intense and ruthlessly {{competitive}} fossil hunting and discovery during <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> Age of American history, marked by a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to outdo the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and the destruction of bones. Each scientist also sought to ruin his rival's reputation and cut off his funding, using attacks in scientific publications.|$|E

5|$|After {{a trip to}} Singapore and Java, in the East Indies (present day Indonesia) in 1875, King Rama V {{brought back}} with him two Englishmen, the {{architect}} John Clunich and his helper Henry C. Rose to design and construct the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall. Construction began on the 7 May 1876. At first the King wanted an entirely European structure with domes. However {{at the insistence of}} Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag), his Chief Minister, the King decided to add <b>the</b> <b>gilded</b> spires and Thai roofs. In 1878 the King personally supervised the raising of the final central spire of the building. The throne hall was completed in 1882, on the centenary of the House of Chakri and the Grand Palace. Thus the new throne hall was given the name Phra Thinang Chakri, meaning literally 'the seat of the Chakris'.|$|E
5|$|As {{the postwar}} years yielded to <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> Age, Troy's {{prosperity}} continued. The wealth created by its industries built {{some of the}} city's most notable Victorian buildings. Frederick Clarke Withers designed First Street's Rice Building in 1871, a five-story flatiron-shaped building representative of his Victorian Gothic style. The Cannon Building got a contemporary mansard roof after two fires. Cummings' 1870 Congregation Berith Sholom Temple on Third Street is among the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States, the oldest Reform synagogue in New York, {{and one of the}} most significant religious buildings in the district from this period. In 1875, George B. Post won a competition to build a new home for the Troy Savings Bank, with an upstairs auditorium. While his building was in the Renaissance Revival style of the time, its forms and decorations anticipated his later work in the Beaux-Arts vein.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition. It {{was unable to}} carry the {{increasing}} volume of traffic caused by the growth of London and the increasing popularity of the automobile; between 1914 and 1929 use of the bridge almost doubled from 6,500 to 12,600 vehicles per day. In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work loose, and in 1922 <b>the</b> <b>gilded</b> finials on the towers {{had to be removed}} because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E

5|$|Grant was {{president}} during <b>the</b> <b>Gilded</b> Age, {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E
5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across <b>the</b> <b>gilded</b> surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are handwritten and one is printed. The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters washed in gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during winter time. In the past, these monks had demanded that <b>the</b> <b>gilded</b> image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E
