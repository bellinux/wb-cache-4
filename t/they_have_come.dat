5|$|In 1889, Huxley wrote:Therefore, {{although}} it be, as I believe, demonstrable {{that we have}} no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.|$|E
5|$|Bolton Wanderers {{have not}} won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them {{overcome}} Manchester United in the FA Cup final {{in front of}} a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The closest <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the League Cup, first in 1995 and again in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E

It would be over six years before they ever improved on this position, when they took second place at Barnsley Central in 2011.|$|R
60|$|Freddie {{glanced at}} the {{deputation}} without interest. His mind was occupied with other matters. He supposed <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to inquire after his ankle and he was mildly thankful that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> in a body instead of one by one. The deputation grouped itself about the bed and shuffled its feet. There was an atmosphere of awkwardness.|$|R
5|$|The {{club was}} formed as Christ Church Football Club in 1874, and adopted its current name in 1877. Founder {{members of the}} Football League in 1888, Bolton have spent {{the highest number of}} seasons of any club in the top flight without winning the title (the 2011–12 season was their 73rd, non-consecutive, year in the top flight). The closest <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to the title is third in the First Division on three {{occasions}} (1891–92, 1920–21 and 1924–25). As of 2015, the club has spent more seasons in the top division than any other club outside the current Premier League.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, {{adaptive}} immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of evidence <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E

25|$|Electric {{toothbrushes}} were developed, {{and initially}} recommended {{for people with}} strength or dexterity problems in their hands, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> into widespread general use. The effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and gingivitis is superior for reducing plaque and gingivitis to that of conventional manual toothbrushes.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{many people}} have {{experienced}} spectacular allergic reactions when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> into contact with both live and dead tick products. Having a tick simply walk over a person's hand produces in some people an intense discomfort and itching – what particular components of the tick body cause these reactions is unknown, {{but it could be}} a water-soluble component that is excreted through the cuticular canals.|$|E

60|$|It {{was upon}} the whole a very {{distinguished}} party, for {{independently of the}} lesser theatrical lights who clustered on this occasion round Mr Snittle Timberry, there was a literary gentleman present who had dramatised in his time two hundred and forty-seven novels as fast as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> out--some of them faster than <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> out--and who WAS a literary gentleman in consequence.|$|R
60|$|The {{officer and}} the others listened with {{interest}} to what Lapp and Dave <b>had</b> to tell. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> across the waterlogged remains of the wrecked batteaux and had been watching sharply for any signs of floating bodies. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> across that of Lieutenant Naster and had buried it but a few hours before. The news that the lieutenant was dead caused Dave to shudder.|$|R
25|$|Gay tourism or LGBT {{tourism is}} a form of niche tourism marketed to gay, lesbian, {{bisexual}} and transgender (LGBT) people. They are usually open about their sexual orientation and gender identity but may be more or less open when traveling; for instance they may be closeted at home or if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> out, may be more discreet in areas known for violence against LGBT people.|$|E
25|$|In Greco-Roman thought, {{the concept}} of metempsychosis {{disappeared}} {{with the rise of}} Early Christianity, reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of salvation of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers, especially Origen, still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> down to us speak explicitly against it.|$|E
25|$|About {{half the}} {{residents}} of the town are Jain, 95% belonging to the Digambara, and another half are Brahmin, suthar, lohar, tailor, mochi, kumhar, somupura, valmiki and other casts are here from many years ago. Shwetambar jains are also residing here. The history of temple actually rovolving around Shwetambar jains and Digambar jains. Many bhil and meena villages are surrounding Rishabhdeo, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> every day to Rishbhdeo for prayer, in sects belonging to Bispanthi Narsingpura and Humad communities.|$|E

25|$|Finding the French escort to be {{substantially}} larger than anticipated, {{and that it}} was manoeuvring to intercept them, Forrest called his captains together for a conference aboard his ship. The three captains met on the quarterdeck of Augusta, whereupon Forrest stated 'Well, gentlemen, you see that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> out to engage us.' Suckling replied 'I {{think it would be a}} pity to disappoint them', to which Langdon agreed. Forrest then closed the discussion by saying 'very well, go onboard your ships again', which Langdon and Suckling proceeded to do, the conference having lasted just half a minute.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on {{historical}} figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually {{make their way into}} comics and television, where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{artifacts}} are clay figurines or statues. Archaeologists have identified {{many of these}} as fetishes or totems, which {{are believed to be}} imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them. These Cucuteni-Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as Goddesses, however, this is actually a misnomer from a scientific point of view. There have been so many of these so-called clay Goddesses discovered in Cucuteni-Trypillia sites that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to represent one of the more readily-identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.|$|E

25|$|However, a bear's first {{reaction}} upon detecting a human {{is to run}} away. Fergus lists a few possible causes for this instinctive reaction, each a speculation or theory based more on intuition rather than physical evidence. Some speculate that bears inherit their cautious nature from {{thousands of years ago}} when they had to be wary of larger and more dangerous carnivores. Some believe that bears have come to relate a human presence to firearms, or other weaponry, that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to fear. Still others think that hunters tend to target more aggressive bears, thus leaving only the more shy and timid bears to reproduce, creating a population of bears less hostile than before.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only one}} out of every 100 bodies interred in the {{cemetery}} became naturally mummified, the concentration of this phenomenon has led to theories about how <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> about. Some believe that they are the result of people who had been buried alive, after mistakenly declared dead. These people, according to belief, died of desperation and asphyxiation and as a sign of their pain, convert into mummies. More commonly, it is likely the result of Guanjuato’s altitude or the abundance of minerals in the soil. However, all of the mummified remains were found in the cemetery’s above ground cement crypts, not in underground graves. Researchers believe the phenomenon is due to the warm, dry climate of the area, which dried out the bodies rapidly.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> {{out of nowhere and}} yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

60|$|The dust of {{the raiders}} was still a long {{distance}} away. Mugambi could not know positively that it hid an enemy; but he had spent a lifetime of savage life in savage Africa, and he had seen parties before come thus unheralded. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> in peace and sometimes <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> in war--one could never tell. It was well to be prepared. Mugambi {{did not like the}} haste with which the strangers advanced.|$|R
