The game's events take place sometime before those of Drake's Fortune, though developers have stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> prequel to Drake's Fortune {{but rather a}} separate original story. Nathan Drake was also on the shortlist for being a guest character in Street Fighter x Tekken, however the idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan to suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> receptor, but instead {{is involved in the}} processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> tonal language. Words are stressed {{on the final}} syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, {{since at least the}} seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is {{typically}} a creamy white, {{with a slight}} salmon tinge, {{but it has been}} observed to vary from white to yellow depending on the density, meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> useful means of identification. Individual spores are a buff-white, amyloid (staining blue in Melzer's reagent) and hyaline. In shape, the spores are elliptic, with a moderately well-developed network of ridges, measuring between 8 and 9.5 by 6.5 to 7.5 micrometres(μm). The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of the}} gills) are shaped like narrow spindles, typically measuring between 40 and 75μm long, but sometimes reaching 86μm in length, by 6 and 11μm wide at the widest point. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gills) are leaf or spindle shaped, measuring between 30 and 52μm long by 4 to 7μm wide. The basidia are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring between 36 and 42μm in length by 8 and 12μm wide.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, {{as in the case}} of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E

Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.|$|E

25|$|Some Western sources {{consider}} that visual kei {{refers to a}} music genre, with its sound usually related to glam rock, punk rock and heavy metal. However, second generation visual kei acts play various genres, including those considered by some as unrelated to rock such as electronic, pop, etc. Other sources, including members of the movement themselves, state <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> music genre and that the freedom of expression, fashion and participation in the related subculture is what exemplifies {{the use of the}} term.|$|E
25|$|The {{density of}} Phobos {{has now been}} {{directly}} measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3. Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile. In addition, images obtained by the Viking probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one. Nevertheless, mapping by the Mars Express probe and subsequent volume calculations do suggest the presence of voids and indicate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> solid chunk of rock but a porous body. The porosity of Phobos was calculated to be 30% ± 5%, or a quarter to a third being empty.|$|E

IIPM has responded by stating that it does not issue degrees and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> university. In September 2014 Delhi High Court censured IIPM for misleading students and restrained it from using words like MBA, BBA, management course, and b-school to describe the programs it offers.|$|E
