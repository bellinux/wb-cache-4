5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their <b>transmitting</b> <b>power,</b> allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts {{have been given a}} lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.|$|E

30|$|Each UE’s <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> can be regulated. However, the <b>transmit</b> <b>powers</b> {{have not}} been {{calibrated}} as the experimental setup {{does not allow for}} such a measurement. Nevertheless, we can change the <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of the UEs by switching between predefined <b>power</b> amplifier (PA) <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> settings, which are denoted by values from − 4 dB to − 32 dB. The PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting of − 4 dB addresses the highest <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> possible and equals approximately a total <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of 23 dBm at a bandwidth of 30 PRBs. Since a PA <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> setting ensures a constant <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> density over the complete bandwidth that is allocated, the total UE <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> changes when changing the bandwidth of the UE. In order to decrease the receive power of UE 0 even more than it is possible with the <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> we add a fixed 20 dB attenuator for this UE’s UL transmission (see Fig. 2).|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} a feedback-based <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> and carrier phase {{adjustment}} scheme {{that controls the}} <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> level and carrier phase offset in order to fully exploit the MPR channel capacity.

The second is the optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> and carrier phase adjustment, which computes the optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> level and carrier phase offset, and feeds the information—which includes the optimal <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> levels and carrier phase shifts—back to the transmitters as described in Figure  1.
