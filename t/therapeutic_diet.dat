500|$|The {{original}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> for paediatric epilepsy provides {{just enough}} protein for body growth and repair, and sufficient calories {{to maintain the}} correct weight for age and height. The classic therapeutic ketogenic diet was developed for treatment of paediatric epilepsy in the 1920s and was widely used into the next decade, but its popularity waned {{with the introduction of}} effective anticonvulsant drugs. This classic ketogenic diet contains a 4:1 [...] ratio by weight of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate. This is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables, bread, pasta, grains and sugar, while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts, cream and butter. Most dietary fat is made of molecules called long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). However, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)—made from fatty acids with shorter carbon chains than LCTs—are more ketogenic. A variant of the classic diet known as the MCT ketogenic diet uses a form of coconut oil, which is rich in MCTs, to provide around half the calories. As less overall fat is needed in this variant of the diet, a greater proportion of carbohydrate and protein can be consumed, allowing a greater variety of food choices.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Nutrition is an {{important}} part of recovery for hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional adequacy of meals provided to and consumed by patients prescribed a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet.</b> Methods: Patients (N ¼ 110) prescribed a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> (texture-modified, low-fiber, oral fluid, or food allergy or intolerance diets) for medical or nutritional reasons were recruited from six wards of a tertiary hospital. Complete (24 -h) dietary provisions and intakes were directly observed and analyzed for energy (kJ) and protein (g) content. A chart audit gathered demographic, clinical, and nutrition-related information to calculate each patient’s disease-specific estimated energy and protein requirements. Provisions and intake were considered adequate if they met 75 % of the patient’s estimated requirements. Results: Mean energy and protein provided to patients (5844 2319 kJ, 53 30 g) were signifi- cantly lower than their mean estimated requirements (8786 1641 kJ, 86 18 g). Consequently, mean nutrition intake (4088 2423 kJ, 37 28 g) were significantly lower than estimated requirements. Only 37 % (41) of patients were provided with and 18 % (20) consumed adequate nutrition to meet their estimated requirements. No <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> provided adequate food to meet the energy and protein requirements of all recipients. Patients on oral fluid diets had the highest estimated requirements (9497 1455 kJ, 93 16 g) and the lowest nutrient provision (3497 1388 kJ, 25 19 g) and intake (2156 1394 kJ, 14 14 g). Conclusion: Hospitalized patients prescribed therapeutic diets (particularly fluid-only diets) are at risk for malnutrition.

This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary <b>therapeutic</b> dry <b>diets</b> designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders in 28 cats with a history of chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of vomiting (n[*]=[*] 25), with a smaller number having a history of concurrent diarrhea (n[*]=[*] 2) or diarrhea alone (n[*]=[*] 3). Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea, and if they were panhypoproteinemic, hypoalbuminemic, hypocobalaminemic, or had a Spec fPL ≥ 5. 4 [*]µg/L.

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{the majority of}} therapeutic diets prescribed were based almost exclusively on empirism and aimed at symptomatic treatment of certain diseases. This situation has been changing radically {{in the last few}} decades. Under the influence of increased knowledge in the field of nutrition on the one hand, the greater insight into the patho- physiology of digestion and the rapid extension of the knowledge of metabolic disorders on the other hand, diet therapy is rapidly developing into a scientifically valid and often causal method of treating diseases. In spite of these developments little attention has so far been paid to definition of terms. The terminology used in the naming and prescribing of diets is extremely confusing and there is no adeauate classification of therapeutic diets. Sometimes the diets are named according to their purpose (cholesterol lowering diet, etc.); in other cases the diet carries the names of the disease (diabetes diet, hepatitis diet, etc.) or of the diseased organ (gastric diet, kidney diet, etc.); in still other cases the (deviating) composition determines the designation (low-protein diet, salt- free diet, fruit diet, etc.) or the diet is named after its "inventor" (Sippy-cure, Meulengracht diet, etc.). Quantity specifications too, are often extremely vague (moderate, limited, low, strict, ascending) and in some cases completely incorrect (e. g. salt-free). Even the definition of the term (<b>therapeutic)</b> <b>diet</b> as such is still a subject of wide-spread disagreement. In practice this confusing nomenclature causes every physician and dietitian to form his own idea of a particular <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet,</b> based on his personal insight and experience. The contents af a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> can therefore vary according to the physician or dietitian and hospital concerned. Whether or to what extent these differences actually rest on medical grounds remains unclear. Directly consequent on this an often unnecessarily large diversity of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> meals is prepared, notably in hospitals. Lack of clearity and discrepancies with regard to the procedure and the delimination of physicians' and dietitians' duties can also be traced back to this. The confusing terminology prevents the realization of satisfactory regulations on labelling of foodstuffs (esp. diet products) and compensation for the costs of a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet.</b> The original occasion for the research was an experiment carried out in 1972 - 1973 in two hospitals, in which the production of meals was entirely contracted out to an industry of foodstuffs. This experiment concerned the industrial production of separate, individual mealcomponents, from which the hospital patients, including the dietpatients, could compose their meals as they choose. This necessitated a clear and unambiguous formulation of the medical requirements these <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> meals had to fulifii. Soon, however, the investigation began to lead {{a life of its own}} and was therefore entirely dissociated from the afore mentioned experiment. The research was primarily directed at logical analysing and ordening of therapeutic diets and the procedure followed by physicians and dietitians in prescribing a diet. The main issue was: What is a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet?</b> In this way a clearly consistent and coherent stock of concepts was developed (Chapter 2 and 3) on the basis of which rules regarding the prescription and composition of therapeutic diets were drawn up. Besides the respective duties and responsibilities of physicians and dietitians were delimited and a sound model for paramedical delegation was developed (Chapter 4). It is essential that physicians and dietitians employ uniform units and specifications of foodstuffs in prescribing and composing therapeutic diets. National agreements have been reached on this head, which can also constitute the basis of a simple system of labelling and declaration of nutritional values (Chapter 5). About half of all hospital patients are prescribed a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet.</b> In Chapter 6 an organization model has been developed for catering in hospitals, applying the results of the preceding chapters. A model according to which diet patients, too, can compose a meal as they choose from the supply of foodstuffs and dishes. By rationalization - the title of the research - we mean the formalization (Chapter 4), normalization (Chapter 5) and organization (Chapter 6) of the prescribing and composing of therapeutic diets, both intramurally and extramurally, by way of logical analysis, definition and ordening (Chapter 2 and 3). The investigation is a composition of basic scientific research (analysis, ordening and definition) and applied scientific research (formalization, normalization and organization). It was carried out in close co-operation with those concerned, notably physicians and dietitians. As regards set-up the investigation can best be described as an action-research. Twenty-eight hospitals took part in the last phase of the research: the diffusion and adoption. We have defined a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> as a diet which deviates from a normal diet for medical reasons. By a normal diet we understand an optimal diet; a diet which under physiological conditions contributes towards the best health to be achieved. A normal diet is synonymous with a healthy diet. In this definition Met is the genus proximum. A <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> differs from a normal diet in two respects (differentiae specificae) :- it is a deviating diet- the deviation rests on medical (patho-physioiogical) grounds. Only if both conditions have simultaneously been complied with we can speak of a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> or modified diet. (There is no completely correct English equivalent for the Dutch word "dieet". Instead of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> a better translation would be modified diet). As in theoretical nutrition we define a diet as a set of nutrients. A therapeutic or modified diet is a diet in which the amount of one more nutrients deviates - for medical reasons - from what would be a normal quantity for the patient in question under physiological conditions. Proceeding from this definition the therapeutic (modified) diets have been divided into four categories: 1. nutrient-limited diets: diets in which the quantity of one or more nu trients is less than normal 2. nutrient-enriched diets: diets in which the quantity of one or more nutrients is more than normal 3. nutrient-eliminated (or-free) diets: diets in which one or more nutrients do not occur at all 4. nutrient-substituted diets: diets in which one or more macro-nutrients are replaced by an equivalent set of micro-nutrients. Substitution is always a combination of limitation or elimination and enrichment. If the quantity of only one nutrient diverges from the normal amount we speak of single modified diets. If the quantity of two or more nutrients deviates from the normal we speak of multiple modified diets or combina tion-diets. A multiple modified Met is a combination of two or more single modified diets. This classification constitutes the basis of a clear, unambiguous and consistent method of naming and prescribing therapeutic diets. In order to keep classification and terminology as simple as possible a distinction has been made between the main characteristics of a modified diet and the derived characteristics. By a main characteristic we mean a modification directly proceeding from the clinial picture of the patient in question. A derived characteristic is a characteristic which is a consequence of a main characteristic and as such is related only indirectly to the patient's disease. A <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> is named - exclusively - after its main characteristic(s). A diet-prescription is correct and complete if it states:a. the main characteristic(s) of a diet; i. e. the name;b. the degree in which the quantity ties of nutrients should deviate from the normal: i. e. the quantities of nutrients permitted or required per 24 hours. (Energy and proteins are indicated preferably in quantities per kg body weight and fats and carbohydrates in per cent of energy). Drawing up such a diet-prescription is part of the duties and responsibili ties of the physician. To promote uniformity and clarity in the method of prescribing (not: the contents) we have developed a modelform on which physicians can, in a simple manner, record the diet-prescription. This diet-prescriptionform at the same time serves as a means of delegation, when patients are referred to a dietitian by the physician. Theoretical nutrition and dietetics are concerned with diet as a set of nutrients. Applied nutrition and dietetics concern diet as a set of foodstuffs. Foodstuffs are (consumable) products containing one or more nutrients. The diet prescription specifies the limiting conditions with which the diet as a set of foodstuffs should comply. Theoretically the problem of composing a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> can be completely solved if the nutritional values of all foodstuffs are known, in particular the content of nutrients relevant to that <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet.</b> In that respect there is no essential difference between composing normal and therapeutic (modified) diets. In both cases the foodstuffs should be selected in such a way that the daily diet complies with the required content of nutrients, on the understanding that in the case of therapeutic diets the quantity of one or more nutrients should be more or less than the normal quantity. Most modified diets too leave a lot of room for combination and variation. But in practice dietitians follow another procedure, taking into account the eating habits (the meal- and menu-pattern) of the patient in question. The patient's customary diet is correced and adapted to the diet prescription bya. prohibiting (in nutrient-limited and -eliminated diets) or requiring (in nutrient-enriched and -substituted diets) the use of particular kinds of foodstuffs per component of the menu:and/or byb. prescribing the use of a maximum quantity (in nutrient-limited diets) or minumum quantity (in nutrient-enriched diets) of particular kinds of foodstuffs per component of the menu. By quantities we understand the number of consumption-units, i. e. the number of slices, spoonfuls, cups, etc. The determining factor with respect to the kind of foodstuff is the quantity of one ore more nutrient(s) the food stuff contains per consumption unit. Similar foodstuffs are foodstuffs containing approximately, i. e. within certain limits, the same amount of a particular, relevant nutrient. The instructions drawn up by a dietitian in this way for a specific patient are called: dietetic-advice. Dietetic-advice is the translation in terms of foodstuffs of the diet- prescription, expressed in terms of nutrients. Dietetic-advice is also the nature of a prescription with regard to the patient, but it is attuned to the requirements and eating habits of the individual patient. Dietetic-advice can be continually adapted even when the prescription remains the same, and its contents can be entirely different for two different patients, even though the diet prescription is identical in both cases. To promote uniformity and clarity with respect to the dietetic advice the foodstuffs are divided into 14 menu groups, on the basis of the meal- and menu-pattern customary in the Netherlands. Each group corresponds with a fixed component of a meal. All foodstuffs belonging to a particular menu group have the same function in the composing of a meal or daily diet. In addition all foodstuffs have been divided into (at most) five kinds per nutrient: nutrient-free, nutrient-limited, nutrient-average, high-nutrient and nutrient-extreme. The classification-matrix, obtained in this way, serves as the basis for drawing up by far the greater proportion of all dietetic advices. With the dietitians and catering managers of the 28 hospitals taking part in our investigation agreements were made about:a. the size of the composition units of the most frequently occurring food stuffs (i. e. the number of grams),b. the limits (i. e. the amount of nutrients per consumption unit) within which foodstuffs are of the same kind (e. g. low-, high-, etc.) That is what we called: normalization. All practical problems, with respect to the prescribing, advising and composing of therapeutic diets, are all indirectly caused wholly or to a considerable extent by the fact that so far little attention has been paid to definition and terminology. Problems accordingly, which have all become wholly solvable thanks to the research. Nevertheless the investigation is first and foremost a basic scientific research. Definition is the basis of every science. The terminology and classification, of therapeutic diets which we have developed serve as a paradigm; a terminological model, for structuring a professional language by means of which implicit skill can be transformed into explicit - and thus verifiable and transmissible - knowledge. A paradigm which, at the same time, serves as a hypothesis for discerning gaps in existing scientific dietetic knowledge. The definition of a therapeutic modified diets constitutes the foundation of the entire research.

30|$|A {{total of}} 100 adults were {{randomly}} selected {{to participate in the}} validation study from the SLDCS and stratified based on ethnicity and area of residence. Ten clusters were selected to represent urban and rural areas, and main ethnicities and each had ten participants. Participants adhering to a prescribed <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> or on a weight reduction diet were excluded from the study. Of the 100 adults initially selected, 18 individuals failed to complete the 7 DWR. A further five were excluded before statistical analyses were undertaken as dietary records were NOT representative of habitual intake with very low (< 800  kcal/day) and very high reported average food intake (> 4000  kcal/day; Jayawardena et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|Severe acute {{malnutrition}} is the world-leading {{cause of}} children under-five's death. Recent metagenomics studies {{have established a}} link between gut microbiota and severe acute malnutrition, describing an immaturity with a striking depletion in oxygen sensitive prokaryotes. Amoxicillin and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> cure {{most of the children}} with severe acute malnutrition but an irreversible disruption of the gut microbiota is suspected in the refractory and most severe cases. In these cases, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> may be unable to reverse the microbiota alteration leading to persistent impaired development or death. In addition, as enteric sepsis is a major cause of death in this context, identification of missing gut microbes to be tested as probiotics (live bacteria that confer a benefit to the host) to restore rapidly the healthy gut microbiota and prevent the gut pathogenic invasion is of foremost importance. In this study, stool samples of malnourished patients with kwashiorkor and healthy children were collected from Niger and Senegal and analyzed by culturomics and metagenomics. We found a globally decreased diversity, a decrease in the hitherto unknown diversity (new species isolation), a depletion in oxygen sensitive prokaryotes including Methanobrevibacter smithii and an enrichment in potentially pathogenic Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Streptococcus gallolyticus. A complex of 12 species identified only in healthy children using culturomics and metagenomics were identified as probiotics candidates, providing a possible, defined, reproducible, safe, and convenient alternative to fecal transplantation to restore a healthy gut microbiota in malnourished children. Microbiotherapy based on selected strains has the potential to improve the current treatment of severe acute malnutrition and prevent relapse and death by reestablishing a healthy gut microbiota...|$|E

The large {{majority}} ofelderly subjects have one or more diagnosed diseases, drug consumption is high, etc, and it is unlikely that specific dietary standards for such a group could be developed or would be useful. More importantly, I argue that the RDA do not and cannot do most of the things which dietary standards ought to do, and their use generates considerable misinformation.

40|$|Regurgitation is {{a common}} manifestation in infants below the age of 1 y, and is a {{frequent}} reason for counselling of general practitioners and paediatricians. Current recommended therapeutic management starts with parental reassurance and dietary measures, followed by prokinetics. In this paper, the efficacy, safety and nutritional implications of the dietary treatment of regurgitation are evaluated, Industrially prepared thickened feeds may contain cereals of fibres; some have a low lipid content and are casein-predominant. Milk-thickened agents can also be added to regular infant feeding. Formulae claimed as 'anti-regurgitation formulae', or positioned as such, {{should be considered as}} medical foods or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diets,</b> and only be available on medical prescription. It is proposed to limit the 'anti- regurgitation' (AR) label to those diets which have been proven clinically effective on regurgitation and which are nutritionally safe.

40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} ketosis were first reported in 1921 by Geyelin and Wilder. The therapeutic ketogenic diet for epilepsy {{was achieved by}} significantly reducing caloric fractions supplied by carbohydrates while increasing those supplied by lipids, thus inducing free fatty acid mobilization and beta oxidation to ketone bodies. Although earlier dietary formulations with animal fats proved unacceptable to many patients, the introduction of medium-chain triglyceride or corn oil as the lipid source in the diet has made the diet more acceptable. Ketosis induced with the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> produces metabolic effects similar to those described in ketotic diabetic patients. It follows that alterations of immune function seen in diabetes mellitus might also occur with other causes of ketosis. When severe, recurrent, Staphylococcus aureus skin infections developed {{in one of our}} patients treated with the ketogenic diet, we undertook an immunologic evaluation and found significant neutrophil dysfunction, which improved when the ketogenic diet was discontinued. Because of this observation, we examined neutrophil function in other patients receiving the ketogenic diet...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMalnutrition is {{the leading}} cause of death {{worldwide}} in children under the age of five, and is the focus of the first World Health Organization (WHO) Millennium Development Goal. Breastfeeding, food and water security are major protective factors against malnutrition and critical factors in the maturation of healthy gut microbiota, characterized by a transient bifidobacterial bloom before a global rise in anaerobes. Early depletion in gut Bifidobacterium longum, a typical maternal probiotic, known to inhibit pathogens, represents the first step in gut microbiota alteration associated with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Later, the absence of the Healthy Mature Anaerobic Gut Microbiota (HMAGM) leads to deficient energy harvest, vitamin biosynthesis and immune protection, and is associated with diarrhea, malabsorption and systemic invasion by microbial pathogens. A <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diet</b> and infection treatment may be unable to restore bifidobacteria and HMAGM. Besides refeeding and antibiotics, future trials including non-toxic missing microbes and nutrients necessary to restore bifidobacteria and HMAGM, including prebiotics and antioxidants, are warranted in children with severe or refractory disease.

However, {{there is no evidence}} to support the view that dietitians should focus their services primarily on patients consuming therapetic diets. Furthermore, health care teams may be uncertain which patient needs dietitian services. The aim of this study was to improve the dietetics referral system in Concord Hospital (CH), a metropolitan teaching hospital in Sydney. A nutrition screening tool called the Nutrition Screening Questionnaire (NSQ) was devised by the researcher and piloted by nursing staff working in urology (surgical) and general medical units for male patients (n= 100) as part of their admission procedures.

There was {{a strong correlation between}} blood selenium concentration and age in children in group 1 up to 10 years of age. Blood selenium concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly lower in the patients who were receiving diets containing reduced amounts of natural protein, and the differences were more than would be expected for age. When the concentrations of selenium in blood from groups 1 and 2 were compared with glutathione peroxidase activity, a strong association was found when blood selenium concentrations were below 1. 26 mumol/l. Reduction in glutathione peroxidase activity may be harmful in the long term, and the addition of selenium to <b>therapeutic</b> <b>diets</b> is recommended...|$|R
