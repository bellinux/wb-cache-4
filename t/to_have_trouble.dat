5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to a tree and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
25|$|Magellan is a {{plausible}} liar who never seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> sneaking in to closed crime scenes, and Klaus is a flamboyant performer with a sinister stage persona {{who is really}} a dull-witted, insensitive womaniser. In some instances, his magic tricks go comically wrong.|$|E

25|$|Trisomy 9, {{believed}} to be the 4th most common trisomy has many long lived affected individuals but only in a form other than a full trisomy, such as Trisomy 9p syndrome or Mosaic trisomy 9. They often function quite well, but tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with speech.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} first season {{when the team}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> {{adjusting}} to his style (having had 22 years of Reynolds' approach, that is not astonishing), Coleman surprised many by leading the Bombers to the premiership in 1962. The team performed brilliantly, losing only two games for the year and crushing Carlton in the Grand Final.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 2009, a Toledo, Ohio man {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> breathing {{after the}} train {{came back into}} the station. He was taken to Bethesda North Hospital, where he died. He had a pre-existing heart condition and was still recovering from a severe flu and a respiratory infection {{at the time of his}} ride.|$|E

25|$|He {{is known}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> {{handling}} {{new technology and}} is frequently confused when operating electronics (such as remote controls and DVD players). He does not usually use computers (although he did use one for an episode of Live during summer 2008, demonstrating how to find homes online) and did not own a cell phone until September 10, 2008. It is often noted, however, that Philbin does not completely reject the technology; he simply has Joy make calls and send e-mails for him.|$|E
25|$|He was {{considered}} by some observers <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> against quality spin, especially against Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh, who dismissed Ponting on 13 occasions in international cricket. Ponting {{had a tendency to}} rock onto the front foot and thrust his wrists at spinning deliveries, resulting in many catches close to the wicket. Ponting rarely employed the sweep shot against spin, something considered unusual for a top-order batsman. Instead, he looked to use his feet to come down the wicket to spinners, or play off the back foot through the off-side.|$|E
25|$|Vaughn {{landed at}} Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base under {{the pretext of}} needing to refuel the aircraft. After landing, Vaughn {{walked back to the}} cabin to speak with the hijacker again. Binh, highly agitated, {{threatened}} to detonate his bomb unless the aircraft immediately departed for Hanoi. Claiming <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> understanding Binh's speech, Vaughn encouraged Binh to lean closer. When he did so, Vaughn restrained Binh in a choke hold and he and two passengers knocked the package from Binh's hand and pinned him to the floor. Vaughn signalled the retired police officer, who shot Binh five times, killing him. Vaughn then carried Binh's body to the rear exit of the aircraft and threw it onto the tarmac.|$|E

25|$|The sixth {{match was}} a Dog Collar match between Roddy Piper and Greg Valentine. The match started back and forth, with Valentine {{targeting}} Piper's injured left ear. Piper gained the advantage {{with the use}} of the chain. Valentine fought back and choked Piper with the chain. Valentine targeted Piper's left ear, causing him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> standing. The match went back and forth until Valentine performed an elbow strike from the turnbuckles and an elbow drop. Valentine climbed the turnbuckles again, but Piper pulled him down. After delivering punches with the chain, Piper pinned Valentine with the chain wrapped around his legs. After the match, Valentine attacked Piper and again choked him with the chain.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} shown that {{children}} who are on the Autism spectrum or have learning disabilities, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or related neurological diseases can benefit from the use of melatonin. This is because they often have trouble sleeping due to their disorders. For example, children with ADHD tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> falling asleep because of their hyperactivity and, as a result, tend to be tired during most of the day. Another cause of insomnia in children with ADHD is the use of stimulants used to treat their disorder. Children who have ADHD then, {{as well as the other}} disorders mentioned, may be given melatonin before bedtime in order to help them sleep.|$|E
25|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorders (FASDs) are a {{group of}} conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected are more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.|$|E

500|$|Out at sea on 15 January 1942, March-Phillipps {{established}} a routine of watches and placed guards on the 29 prisoners they had taken. During the evening they started <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with the tugs' engines and the tow ropes to the captured vessels. The next day Vulcan reached the {{location for the}} rendezvous and was [...] "captured" [...] at sea by HMS Violet. Nuneaton, suffering from engine trouble, managed to contact the Nigerian collier Ilorin by semaphore, which in turn contacted Lagos, and a ship was dispatched to tow them into port.|$|E

500|$|As the Americans withdrew, many Iraqis and Americans {{questioned}} {{the ability of}} the Iraqi security forces, especially the police, to protect the province. Others expressed skepticism over whether Iran would dominate Iraq and whether the Iraqi government would be able to provide security. One angry Iraqi described the American legacy as [...] "total destruction... you just came in, destroyed, and left." [...] Discussing the American withdrawal, a journalist in Fallujah predicted that the Government of Iraq would continue <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with Anbar Province, saying, [...] "Anbar was where instability began in Iraq. It was where stability returned. And it is where instability could start again." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Reid's piece {{appeared}} in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is [...] "one {{of the most}} peculiar stories of the year", he cautioned readers. [...] "Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash {{to go up in}} flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this." ...|$|E

After recovering from what {{was reported to be}} a chest infection, he returned to the team on 28 December, having missed four matches, and marked his return with his side's only goal in a 3–1 home defeat to Stockport County. Reading dropped to 12th place on 6 January 1975, and were only three points above the re-election places; however, by the time they took on Workington at home on 3 February they had risen to 10th. Reading won 3–0, with Friday scoring the third goal with a spectacular header: [...] "Diving full length barely a foot off the ground, Friday risked life and limb to head home a truly memorable goal", wrote the Evening Post match reporter. [...] "True to form, he had to spoil things for himself by getting booked three minutes later".|$|E
