5|$|In late May 2011, Sukhoi {{delivered}} the first Su-35S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry {{to prepare the}} aircraft for operational service. Before {{the start of the}} tests, the aircraft's Su-35's avionics and integrated defence systems were reportedly not up to the standard of American aircraft. The first of two stages of the trials commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights as the air force tested the type's <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> which were assessed {{by the end of that}} year to have generally complied with requirements. Of the batch of six production aircraft that were handed over in December 2012, five flew to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky where the aircraft would, in February 2013, start the second stage of the trials. This stage, which was scheduled to last eighteen months, would focus on the Su-35's weapons and manoeuvrability in combat.|$|E
5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} tendering to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial loudspeakers. Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> and altered resonance patterns. The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974.|$|E

His hard-working playing style was regarded by critics as creative in attacking, assisting many goals as well as scoring himself, as opposed to just [...] "goal poaching". Because of his <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> Del Piero usually played as a supporting-striker, which was his preferred role, although he was a tactically versatile forward, with good movement, who was capable of playing anywhere along the front line. He was also occasionally deployed between the midfield and the strikers as a playmaking attacking midfielder, known in Italy as the trequartista position, due to his vision, passing range, ball control, dribbling ability (in particular in one on one situations) and creativity, although he often stated that this was not his preferred position. Del Piero was also employed occasionally as a winger throughout his career, in particular during his time under Sacchi with the Italy national football team, due to his tendency to drift onto the wings, defensive work-rate, and his crossing accuracy, as well as his ability with both feet.|$|E

2500|$|Gerhards and Schäfer {{say they}} have found [...] "only minimal {{evidence}} to support the idea that the internet is a better communication space as compared to print media". [...] "In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur". [...] The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. [...] "Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on <b>technical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of websites". [...] For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines' algorithms. [...] "Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions". Another tactic that supports this view is astroturfing. The Guardian columnist George Manbiot said that Astroturfing software, [...] "has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy".|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to question the interpretation of the usually-found positive correlation between firm-specific pay inequalities and productivity. We estimate from French employer-employee matched data this correlation and confirm that it is positive, even after accounting for fixed unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity using instrumental variables. This result is consistent with the idea that wage inequality is one of the tools that are available to stimulate workers productivity. However, in such a framework, pay inequality is an optimization variable controlled by the firm, and should therefore appear as endogenous. This is not the case: tests show that variations in pay inequality are exogenous, i. e. they are imposed to the firm in a way that is uncorrelated to other unobserved determinants of productivity. We therefore adapt the standard model of incentive theory to make it compatible with this exogeneity property, along the lines of Lazear (1989). The model that we develop is a model where the choice of a higher or lower degree of pay inequality is fully constrained by an exogenous <b>technical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the firm, i. e. the varying importance of collective and individual effort in its production function. In such a context, the degree of pay inequality is interpreted as an indirect measure of this <b>technical</b> <b>characteristic.</b> We confirm this interpretation by examining the relationship between pay inequality and organizational characteristics of firms measured by the REPONSE survey.
