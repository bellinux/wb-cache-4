5|$|After Parry-Jones's death Scott lived {{quietly for}} a while in the West Country. In January 1974 he met Tim Keigwin, Thorpe's Conservative {{opponent}} in North Devon, and gave his version of his relationship with Thorpe. Keigwin was advised by the Conservative leadership that the material should not be used. Scott also confided in his doctor, Ronald Gleadle, who was treating him for depression. He had shown Gleadle his dossier of documents; the doctor, without Scott's knowledge or consent, sold the papers to Holmes, who had assumed the role of Thorpe's protector after Bessell settled permanently in California in January 1974. Holmes paid £2,500 for the documents, which were promptly burned in the home of Thorpe's solicitor. A further cache of papers was discovered in November 1974, by builders renovating a London office formerly used by Bessell. They found a briefcase containing letters and photographs that apparently compromised Thorpe, among them Scott's 1965 letter to Ursula Thorpe. Undecided what to do with their find, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to the Sunday Mirror newspaper. Sidney Jacobson, the paper's deputy chairman, decided not to publish the material and passed the briefcase and its content to Thorpe. Copies of the documents were, however, kept in the newspaper's files.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} the oldest {{settlement}} {{at the site of}} modern Acre were found at the tell (archaeological mound) known as Tel Akko in Hebrew and Tell el-Fukhar in Arabic, and date to the Early Bronze Age I (c. 3500-3050 BCE); however, this farming community endured only for a couple of centuries, after which the site was abandoned, possibly after being inundated by the rising sea waters, only to be resettled as an urban centre during the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000-1550 BCE). Acre was inhabited from then on continuously, although being subject to conquest and destruction several times, most recently in 1291 when the Mamluks razed the city once <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> from the Crusaders; in the 14th and into the 15th centuries it was not more than a large village. Acre is therefore counted among the oldest continuously inhabited sites in the region.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{it was thought that}} only Smith had seen the manuscript. However, in 2003, Guy Stroumsa {{reported}} that he and a group of other scholars had seen it in 1976. During a visit to Mar Saba, Stroumsa, along with the late Hebrew University professors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, Greek Orthodox Archimandrite Meliton, and a Mar Saba monk, relocated the document where Smith had left it. Stroumsa, Meliton, and company determined that the manuscript might be safer in Jerusalem than in Mar Saba. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> back with them, and Meliton subsequently brought it to the Patriarchate library. The group looked into having the ink tested but the only entity in the area with such technology was the Jerusalem police. Meliton did not want to leave the manuscript with the police, so no test was taken. Stroumsa published his account upon learning that he was the last living Western academic to have seen the letter.|$|E

[...] Despite the musical's success in Melbourne, Bennetto {{did not have any}} plans for Keating! {{after the end of the}} comedy festival. However, producer Catherine Woodfield (Bennetto's partner and Trades Hall publican) insisted they develop it further. [...] Between 2005 and 2006 <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> on tour across Australia, including a week of shows in the Sydney Opera House, a return season at Melbourne's Trades Hall, a two-week season at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, a week of shows at the Brisbane Powerhouse and two nights in Darwin.|$|E
500|$|New York Dolls {{was mixed}} {{in less than}} half a day. Rundgren felt the band seemed distracted and disinterested at that point, so he tried unsuccessfully to ban them from the mixing session. For the final mix, he {{minimized}} the sound of Nolan's drumming. In retrospect, Rundgren said the quality of the mix was poor because the band had hurried and questioned him while mixing the record: [...] "It's too easy for it to become a free-for-all, with every musician only hearing their own part and not the whole. They all had other places to be, so rather than split, they rushed the thing and if that wasn't enough <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to the crappy mastering lab that Mercury had put them in." [...] Thunders famously complained to a journalist that Rundgren [...] "fucked up the mix" [...] on New York Dolls, adding to stories that the two had clashed during the album's recording. Both Johansen and Scoppa later said they did not see any conflict between the two and that Thunders' typically foolish behavior was misinterpreted. Johansen later praised Rundgren for how he enhanced and equalized each instrument, giving listeners the impression that [...] " [...] in a room and there's a band playing", while Sylvain said his mix accurately captured how the band sounded live.|$|E
500|$|Underbelly began airing in New Zealand on TV3 on Sunday at 9:30pm, but {{the network}} put the [...] series on hiatus after three episodes {{because it was}} [...] "not {{performing}} as expected in the time slot". Due to a public outcry, TV3 reversed their decision 48hours later, saying it was [...] "bowing to the pressure of angry fans". TV3 reinstated the series in its old timeslot, but rescheduled it to 11:15pm on Tuesday evenings just weeks later. TV3 senior publicist Nicole Wood said the show had failed to win new viewers in the Sunday slot, {{and even though they}} were [...] "inundated with fans" [...] when <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> off air, it [...] "still didn't rate" [...] on its second showing. The series was brought back to primetime in July 2009, after the sequel series performed well in New Zealand. Beginning with episode 1, the series is currently playing every Thursday at 9:30pm. In April 2008, the Nine Network signed an international distribution deal with Fox International Channels and Portman Film & Television. The series will be broadcast in Scandinavia, Canada, France, the UK, Italy (Rai 4), Balkans, Korea, Pan-Asia, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and Germany. Gyngell said, [...] "to say we are pleased is an understatement– we are delighted that the series will gain international audiences and global recognition". Scottish commercial broadcaster STV have signed up to broadcast the series. Series 3 is now broadcasting after the good reception of the first two series.|$|E

I still cannot listen to it, because everything I wanted for that record, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> away." [...] Jim Morrison, whom Nico later called [...] " [...] soul brother", {{encouraged her to}} write her own songs; this was [...] "a key breakthrough for [...] ". They were together in California in July and August 1967, often driving into the desert and experimenting with peyote. Morrison, who encouraged Nico to write down her dreams, read Mary Shelley, William Blake and Samuel Taylor Coleridge to her. He recorded his chemical visions and dreams, using the material for his songs as he imagined the opium-addicted Coleridge had worked. In 1986 Nico said, [...] "He taught me to write songs. I never thought that I could... He really inspired me a lot. It was like looking in a mirror then." [...] She began writing her own material and performing it to an intimate audience at Steve Paul's club, the Scene. Nico composed her music on a harmonium bought, according to Richard Witts, from a San Francisco hippie; manager Danny Fields recalled, [...] "I think Leonard Cohen may have given it to her, or {{had something to do}} with her getting it." [...] With that instrument, [...] "she discovered not only her own artistic voice but a whole new realm of sound." [...] The droning pump organ became her trademark.|$|E
500|$|When Roddenberry pitched Star Trek to MGM, it was warmly received, but no {{offer was}} made. He {{then went to}} Desilu Productions, but rather than being offered a one-script deal, he {{was hired as a}} {{producer}} and allowed to work on his own projects. His first was a half-hour pilot called Police Story (not {{to be confused with the}} anthology series created by Joseph Wambaugh), which was not picked up by the networks. Having not sold a pilot in five years, Desilu was having financial difficulties; its only success was I Love Lucy. Roddenberry took the Star Trek idea to Oscar Katz, head of programming, and the duo immediately started work on a plan to sell the series to the networks. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to CBS, which ultimately passed on it. The duo later learned that CBS had been eager to find out about Star Trek because it had a science fiction series in development—Lost in Space. Roddenberry and Katz next took the idea to Mort Werner at NBC, this time downplaying the science fiction elements and highlighting the links to Gunsmoke and Wagon Train. The network funded three story ideas, and selected [...] "The Menagerie", which was later known as [...] "", to be made into a pilot. (The other two later became episodes of the series.) While most of the money for the pilot came from NBC, the remaining costs were covered by Desilu. Roddenberry hired Dorothy Fontana, better known as D. C. Fontana, as his assistant. They had worked together previously on The Lieutenant, and she had eight script credits to her name.|$|E

[...] Canning said that the other stories were [...] "also very fun", and having been a critic to Jane Krakowski's Jenna, Canning said that her appearance in [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was [...] "effectively funny without overdoing her self-centeredness." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it a 9.1 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote {{that this was a}} [...] "very funny episode, boosted by the ingenious casting of Alan Alda" [...] as Jack's biological father. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised 30 Rock for delivering [...] "comically" [...] with this episode, and observing there were good elements in it. Rabin opined that the casting of Alda as Jack's father was [...] "inspired", and gave [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] an A− grade rating. Entertainment Weekly contributor Aly Semigran was complimentary towards the episode, and appreciated the guest appearances from Alda and Steve Buscemi. Bruce Fretts for TV Guide Magazine said that [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was [...] "strong", and cited that it had [...] "quotable inside-TV digs... an instant chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda... and an infectious rendition of 'It Takes Two' by Liz and Pete." [...] Mike Moody of AOL's TV Squad hoped that [...] "someone on the show figure out" [...] {{what to do with the}} Jenna character, and suggested that she have a love interest [...] "that makes her mature or... makes her move away" [...] because Jenna's [...] "vacuous, selfish aging diva routine has gotten old already." [...] Moody, however, said that the best part of Tracy's story was the karate showdown between Donald and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz).|$|E
