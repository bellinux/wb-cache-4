The {{aim of this}} paper is to determine the factors that influences <b>the</b> expect <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> this unique group. Expected well-being is an important determinant of both the decision to migrate and the choice of a country of destination. Knowledge about this determinant therefore informs refugee policies. The results show that only a few of the factors found in the literature explaining <b>the</b> expected <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> voluntary migrants also explain <b>the</b> expected <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> forced migrants. However, a number of factors found in the literature that explain <b>the</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> and <b>well-being</b> in general <b>of</b> refugees and asylum-seekers also went towards explaining <b>the</b> expected <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> this group. These factors include: government assistance, culture, the time spent in South Africa, economic factors, crime, refugee status, reasons for leaving the home countries and the number of people staying in a house in the receiving country. The findings of this study emphasise the differences between forced and voluntary migrants and highlight the factors that influence <b>the</b> expected <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> forced migrants.

Social Network Sites (SNSs) allow users to create online profiles and content, establish connections, share content, develop interactions with their connections and consume content provided by their network. The {{rapid growth in}} the number of users of SNSs makes it important to examine their impact on users and their potential to improve psychological well-being. A major limitation of most previous studies was that they relied on healthy students as participants. Little research attention has been paid to the ability of SNSs to promote <b>the</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> other cohorts of SNS users. People affected by cancer are using SNSs such as Facebook for informational and emotional exchange with people with the same health concern. This research examined the impact of SNSs use on <b>the</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> users of the Ovarian Cancer Australia (OCA) Facebook. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research sought to answer the question: In what ways and to what extent does SNS use impact <b>the</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> cancer-affected people?Semi-structured interviews with users of the OCA Facebook were used to assess how and in what ways SNSs use impacts <b>the</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> cancer-affected people. A theoretical model was proposed to develop a better understanding of the relationship. Analysis of data collected through a subsequent quantitative survey confirmed the theoretical model and empirically revealed the extent to which SNSs use impacts <b>the</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> cancer-affected people. Analysis showed that the use of OCA Facebook enhances social support, improves the experience of social connectedness, develops social presence and learning – and ultimately, improves psychological well-being. This study contributes to a better understanding of the ways that SNSs use is associated with psychological well-being among cancer-affected people. Our theoretical model improves understanding of the factors that mediate the positive impact of Facebook use on <b>the</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> cancer-affected people.

40|$|Aims and objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{observational}} scale to measure <b>the</b> social <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> nursing home residents, by assessing not only the social behaviour of the resident towards others, but also the behaviour of others towards the resident. Background. Traditionally, aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> nursing home residents are assessed according to the social activities and interactions where they engage. Although these are important indicators <b>of</b> social <b>well-being,</b> other important indicators may include the positive social behaviour of others towards the resident (e. g. confirming the resident's behaviour or showing affection). Design. A cross-sectional descriptive survey design. Method. From the perspective of human social needs, items relating to fulfilment of the needs for affection, behavioural confirmation and status were formulated and tested. This took place in three nursing homes in the Netherlands that provide somatic and psycho-geriatric care. Results. The study (sample n = 306) yielded a short and reliable scale, <b>the</b> Social <b>Well-being</b> <b>Of</b> Nursing home residents-scale, with separate sub-scales (three items each) for fulfilment of the three social needs. Conclusions. These first results indicate that overall social well-being and its sub-dimensions can be measured with this new observational scale, although its validity needs to be confirmed. Including the social behaviour of others towards the resident may have provided a more comprehensive measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> nursing home residents. Relevance to clinical practice. This measure may help to underscore the importance of the social behaviour of others (e. g. caregivers) for <b>the</b> overall social <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> residents and with that assist care-providers in nursing homes to improve <b>the</b> social <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residents...|$|R

40|$|Background: Because of the {{problems}} measuring subjective well-being in people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities, there are no studies to date which explore the factors contributing to <b>the</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> in these groups. We wanted to explore the client and service characteristics contributing to <b>the</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> persons with severe and profound intellectual disabilities, asmeasured by the MIPQ (Ross & Oliver, 2003). Materials and methods: The MIPQ was completed for 360 persons with severe or profound intellectual disabilities {{by a member of}} the direct support staff. They also provided us with information on client, service and informant characteristics. Results: We found that <b>the</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> persons with profound intellectual disabilities was lower than <b>the</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> people with mild, moderate or severe intellectual disabilities or people without disabilities. Client and informant characteristics but no service characteristics were found to have an influence on <b>the</b> subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> people with severe and profound intellectual disabilities. Conclusion: As it is important for policy making to identify residence service and staff factors related to subjective <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> persons with severe and profound intellectual disabilities, further research should try to identify these factors, taking in account the client characteristics that are found to be related to subjective well-being in this study. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles for <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of}} life rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramopakhyana (the {{narrative}} of Rama in the epic Mahabharata), Sita informs Hanuman that Trijata brought her {{a message from}} Avindhya about <b>the</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> Rama, and that he and Lakshamana will soon come to rescue her from Lanka. Trijata thus assumes the role assigned to Kala in the original Ramayana. The Raghuvamsa, the Setubandha, the Balaramadasa Ramayana, the Kakawin Ramayana and the Seri Rama all replace Sarama with Trijata in the episode where {{the truth of the}} illusory head of Rama is revealed to Sita. The Prasannaraghava has Trijata inform Sita about the burning of Lanka, instead of Sarama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana makes Trijata the saviour of Sita, when she stops Ravana from killing Sita in the Ashoka Vatika; this role was originally assigned to Mandodari. Trijata again saves Sita's life when a vengeful Ravana rushes to slay his captive after his son Indrajit is killed in the war. In the Ramayana, Suparshva – a minister of Ravana – stops him, while other adaptations attribute the act variously to Avindhya or Mandodari.|$|E
