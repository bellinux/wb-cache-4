2500|$|While {{comparable}} to geisha, these women make livings entertaining business men, often spending {{large amounts of}} their work time with them. [...] Hostesses, however, can choose this path, rather than being sold into it, like a brothel girl from the Meiji era. [...] This type of work borders on the sex industry, with women being paid to amuse men who eat and drink at night clubs, salons, taverns, etc. [...] Though the hours are irregular, <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>is</b> very good for women willing to work in this sector, some of whom even aspire to own their own private establishments. [...] Due to the odd nature of this work, though, this type of employment is usually only sought by divorcees, young unmarried Japanese women, or married women in need of quick cash. Hostesses will often play {{the part of a}} mother or housewife for male customers, caring for them, inflating their ego, and flirting with them, offering bits of flattery for tips. [...] Depending {{on the size of the}} bar, night club, etc., there may be a large show to relax the customers; or in smaller establishments, the hostess will spend one-on-one time with her clients, gaining social ties while charging her clients for their attention. [...] Though it can be a good source of quick money for women willing to work odd hours, normally single women with a low education, usually around the high school level, are the primary hostess candidates. [...] They work late into the nights and sleep during the days, so these women are close to opposites of the salarymen they entertain. [...] In the 21st century, this type of industry has drastically evolved. [...] Pictures of kimono clad hostesses or hostesses willing to dress up in costumes for the amusement of customers have become an iconic image for tourists.|$|E

50|$|Mexican laborers {{accepted}} such {{low wages}} because <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>was</b> double {{of what they}} would be paid in Mexico for similar work. The higher wages {{made it difficult for}} railroad employers in Mexico to keep a steady workforce.|$|R

60|$|In every grade named <b>the</b> <b>pay</b> <b>is,</b> I believe, {{higher than}} that given by us, or, as I imagine, by any other nation.

It will of course be understood that {{there is nothing in the}} American army answering to our colonel of a regiment. With us the officer so designated holds a nominal command of high dignity and emolument as a reward for past services.|$|E
