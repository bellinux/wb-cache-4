50|$|Mustard {{agent was}} {{possibly}} developed {{as early as}} 1822 by César-Mansuète Despretz (1798-1863). Despretz described the reaction of sulfur dichloride and ethylene but never made mention of any irritating properties of the reaction product, which makes the claim doubtful. In 1854, another French chemist, Alfred Riche (1829-1908), repeated this procedure {{but he did not}} describe any adverse physiological properties. In 1860, the British scientist Frederick Guthrie synthesized and characterized the mustard agent compound, and he also noted its irritating properties, especially in tasting. In 1860, chemist Albert Niemann, known as a pioneer in cocaine chemistry, repeated the reaction, and recorded blister-forming properties. In 1886, Viktor Meyer published a paper describing a synthesis that produced good yields. He combined 2-chloroethanol with aqueous potassium sulfide, and then treated the resulting <b>thiodiglycol</b> with phosphorus trichloride. The purity of this compound was much higher, and the adverse health effects on exposure much more severe. These symptoms presented themselves in his assistant, and in order to {{rule out the possibility that}} his assistant was suffering from a mental illness (psychosomatic symptoms), Meyer had this compound tested on laboratory rabbits, most of which died. In 1913, the English chemist Hans Thacher Clarke (known for the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction) replaced the phosphorus trichloride with hydrochloric acid in Meyer's formulation while working with Emil Fischer in Berlin. Clarke was hospitalized for two months for burns after one of his flasks broke. According to Meyer, Fischer's report on this accident to the German Chemical Society sent the German Empire on the road to chemical weapons.|$|E

We sought {{to speed up}} staining and tissue clearing to improve compatibility with diagnostic needs without detriment to histology or other assays. Thick sections (2 – 3 mm) of normal human breast tissue and whole mouse mammary glands were stained with alum-carmine, aceto-carmine, Harris's haematoxylin, cresyl violet, neutral red, thionin, 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI), ethidium bromide (EB), or propidium iodide (PI) and cleared in xylene (refractive index ν[*]=[*] 1. 50), benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate (BABB; ν[*]=[*] 1. 59), xylene–BABB (X-BABB), <b>thiodiglycol</b> (2, 2 ′-thiodiethanol, ν[*]=[*] 1. 52) or anethole (ν[*]=[*] 1. 56). Tissue was then paraffin embedded for IHC for ER, PR, E-cadherin, CD 31 or cytokeratin 7. Haematoxylin and alum-carmine are excellent non-fluorescent subgross stains giving strong nuclear staining and minimal background. DAPI and EB permeate thick sections poorly but PI penetrates well, with a high signal-to-noise ratio after clearing in BABB or X-BABB. Other clearing agents were less effective, including <b>thiodiglycol.</b> Anethole's unpleasant odour precluded further evaluation. All evaluated clearing agents preserved comparable immunoreactivity for all markers. PI is a promising stain for subgross breast studies, compatible with BABB clearing.

40|$|We {{include in}} this review an {{assessment}} of the formation, environmental fate, and mammalian and ecotoxicity of CW agent degradation products relevant to environmental and occupational health. These parent CW agents include several vesicants: sulfur mustards [undistilled sulfur mustard (H), sulfur mustard (HD), and an HD/agent T mixture (HT) ]; nitrogen mustards [ethylbis(2 -chloroethyl) amine (HN 1), methylbis(2 -chloroethyl) amine (HN 2), tris(2 -chloroethyl) amine (HN 3) ], and Lewisite; four nerve agents (O-ethyl S-[2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl] methylphosphonothioate (VX), tabun (GA), sarin (GB), and soman (GD)); and the blood agent cyanogen chloride. The degradation processes considered here include hydrolysis, microbial degradation, oxidation, and photolysis. We also briefly address decontamination but not combustion processes. Because CW agents are generally not considered very persistent, certain degradation products of significant persistence, even those that are not particularly toxic, may indicate previous CW agent presence or that degradation has occurred. Of those products for which there are data on both environmental fate and toxicity, only a few are both environmentally persistent and highly toxic. Major degradation products estimated to be of significant persistence (weeks to years) include <b>thiodiglycol</b> for HD; Lewisite oxide for Lewisite; and ethyl methyl phosphonic acid, methyl phosphonic acid, and possibly S-(2 -diisopropylaminoethyl) methylphosphonothioic acid (EA 2192) for VX. Methyl phosphonic acid is also the ultimate hydrolysis product of both GB and GD. The GB product, isopropyl methylphosphonic acid, and a closely related contaminant of GB, diisopropyl methylphosphonate, are also persistent. Of all of these compounds, only Lewisite oxide and EA 2192 possess high mammalian toxicity.

40|$|<b>Thiodiglycol</b> (TDG) is {{both the}} {{precursor}} for chemical synthesis of mustard gas and the product of mustard gas hydrolysis. TDG can also react with intermediates of mustard gas degradation to form more toxic and/or persistent aggregates, or reverse the pathway of mustard gas degradation.

The biotransformation of TDG has been demonstrated in three soils not previously exposed to the chemical. TDG biotransformation occurred via the oxidative pathway with an optimum rate at pH 8. 25. In contrast with bacteria isolated from historically contaminated soil, which could degrade TDG individually, a consortium of three bacterial strains isolated from the soil never contaminated by mustard gas was able to grow on TDG in minimal medium and in hydrolysate derived from an historical mustard gas bomb.
