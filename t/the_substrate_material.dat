25|$|Like ink jet {{material}} depositioning, inkjet etching (IJE) deposits precise {{amounts of}} solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>material</b> and induce a structure or pattern. Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLED's {{can be used}} to increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. Inkjet etching {{can be used to}} selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of water based due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.|$|E

Deposition of molybdenum nitride films has been carried out using reactive magnetron sputtering for characterization. The films were characterized in terms of their thickness, hardness and adhesion. The films were reasonably hard but poorly adherent to the steel flats. A wear test rig designed, constructed and commissioned by another research student to carry out impact wear tests was adapted for adhesive wear tests.

40|$|Shelf {{cultivation}} of oyster mushrooms {{is a unique}} Korean production method. This method was adapted by Korean scientists in the early 1980 ’s from button mushroom (Agaricus bisporous) growing on shelves. Button mushroom cultivation can be summarized as follows: Phase I (outdoor fermentation), Phase II (pasteurization and conditioning), Phase III (spawning and incubation), fruiting, harvesting and emptying. The unique characteristics of shelf {{cultivation of}} oyster mushroom in Korea include the fact that <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> is fermented in three steps (pre-fermentation, pasteurization, and post-fermentation) {{rather than on the}} shelf itself. Unlike the pasteurization process that lasts for 2 - 6 hours in most countries, shelf cultivation requires <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> to be pre-fermented outdoors for 2 - 3 days, then pasteurized at 60 - 65 ℃ for 8 - 10 hours, and finally post-fermented at 45 - 55 ℃ for 3 - 4 days. This process requires considerable time and generates significant expenses. In Korea, the main methods of oyster mushroom growing are shelf cultivation, bag cultivation and bottle cultivation. Korean oyster mushroom growers ferment <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> in shelf cultivation while they sterilize <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> in <b>the</b> cases of bag and bottle cultivation.

40|$|Surface {{engineering}} such as surface treatment, coating, {{and surface}} modification are employed to increase surface hardness, minimize adhesion, and hence, to reduce friction and improve resistance to wear. To have optimal tribological performance of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) hard coating to <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>materials,</b> pretreatment of <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> is always advisable to avoid plastic deformation of <b>the</b> <b>substrate,</b> which {{may result in}} eventual coating failure. The surface treatment results in hardening of <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> and increase in load support effect. Many approaches aim to improve the adhesion of the coatings onto <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> and nitriding is {{the one of the}} best suitable options for the same.

The mechanisms of entrainment are very complex that laboratory tests were conducted herein and recorded by a high-speed camera. According to the monitoring videos, <b>the</b> <b>substrate</b> <b>materials</b> spray intensively as soon as they are impacted, and then are continually scoured by the debris avalanche. Under the drag of the debris avalanche, a thin layer of bed materials are activated to move, and the thickness of this layer decrease along the accumulation section. Therefore, based on these observations, conclusion can be drawn that the entrainment mechanisms of the debris avalanches in our experiments include impact erosion and basal abrasion. The impact erosion of bed materials is seen to be the predominant mode of entrainment. The amount of entrained materials and maximum erosion depth increases with increasing avalanche mass. However, the erosion depth increases nonlinearly with decreasing substrate thickness.|$|R
