5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire <b>to</b> <b>offend.</b> Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} also {{released}} in the United States, by the New York branch of Méliès's company. During the summer of 1905, Klaw & Erlanger showed it at the Aerial Gardens, on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre. In the American release, the scenes were slightly rearranged: {{the first and second}} scenes were switched in order, as were the sixth and seventh. In addition, because of a renumbering, ten tableaux were advertised instead of the French catalogue's twelve, although no scenes were removed. (The two prints of the film surviving in the Méliès family's archive, the Cinémathèque Méliès, use the French ordering of the scenes.) Another discrepancy between the French and American catalogues occurs for political reasons: the American catalog specifies that the protagonist is King Leopold, but the French one keeps the identity anonymous, so as not <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> Belgian audiences. Similarly, the Alps in the film are named as such in the American catalog but are unnamed in the French one.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between anger, violence and offending {{is not well}} understood; there is debate in the current literature regarding {{the nature of this}} relationship. This issue is of importance because of the widespread use of anger management programmes as a means <b>to</b> reduce anger-mediated <b>offending.</b> This study specifically examined the role of anger in offending behaviour for patients with coexisting problems with anger and psychosis. Grounded theory was used to analyse patients’ file data from an Anger Management and Emotion Regulation programme in a Medium Secure Unit. Grounded theory analysis allowed for a theory of <b>offending</b> <b>to</b> be generated, showing what concepts contribute <b>to</b> <b>offending</b> and thereby determining the role anger plays in offending in mentally disordered patients. Anger, mental illness, substance misuse and social issues were recognised as contributing factors <b>to</b> <b>offending</b> behaviour. This provides justification for managing anger in order to prevent reoffending...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the results of a {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of studies relating measures of cognitive and affective empathy <b>to</b> <b>offending.</b> It was possible to calculate a common measure of effect size (the standardized mean difference) in 35 studies, 21 of cognitive empathy and 14 of affective empathy. Low cognitive empathy was strongly related <b>to</b> <b>offending,</b> while low affective empathy was weakly related <b>to</b> <b>offending.</b> The Hogan Empathy Scale and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy produced stronger relationships with offending than the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The relationship between low empathy and offending was relatively strong for violent offenders, but relatively weak for sex offenders. This relationship was stronger for younger people than for older people. The relationship between low empathy and offending disappeared after controlling for intelligence and SES. More research is needed to investigate the causal links between low SES, low intelligence, low empathy, and offending. Better measures of empathy are needed, and empathy and <b>offending</b> need <b>to</b> be measured using self-reports in prospective longitudinal studies...|$|R

5|$|The victors {{also found}} a golden crown among the booty. It was reputed {{to be from the}} time of the fifteenth-century Majapahit empire, during which there were reports of the use of a golden crown. The crown was handed to Captain Tack of the VOC, who insisted on {{requiring}} 1,000 Rds. before giving it to the king. This behaviour seemed <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> the king and might have contributed to Tack's death at the Mataram court in 1686. On 27 November, Hurdt presented the crown to the king, who proceeded to wear it. In an act of cultural misunderstanding, the VOC fired musket and cannon salutes, thinking the event was a coronation in the European sense. In reality, crowns did not have ceremonial importance in Javanese royal protocol. This episode attracted much attention among later historians. Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf opined that the king would later consider this event as a symbol of the European's condescension and that they were instrumental to the king's legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was threefold: to examine (1) the {{relation}} between both cognitive and affective empathy and prosocial behavior; (2) the relation between both cognitive and affective empathy and offending; and (3) the role of cognitive distortions in the relation between cognitive empathy, affective empathy and offending in a sample of adolescent girls with lower SES and education (N = 264). Results showed that both cognitive and affective empathy were positively related to prosocial behavior. Furthermore, cognitive empathy was positively related <b>to</b> <b>offending,</b> whereas affective empathy was not related <b>to</b> <b>offending.</b> Finally, no support was found for our hypothesis that cognitive distortions play a moderating role in the relation between empathy and offending...|$|R

40|$|Severe punishments have {{historically}} been the bedrock of criminal deterrence, but criminologists have long documented that such threats are often ineffective. Instead, {{it has been the}} certainty of sanctions that has been most emphasized and that has garnered empirical support.

Using data from a sample of young adults, the authors find mixed support for "boundary-crossing": Although combinations of objective certainty and severity did not necessarily result in substantive differences in perceptions of certainty and severity, an individual's own perceived certainty and severity related <b>to</b> <b>offending</b> differently depending on the information provided to them about the objective certainty and severity of punishment.

40|$|There is {{current and}} ongoing concern {{regarding}} the potential criminalisation of looked after young people. This {{concern has been}} based on recent research across England and Wales which has identified that young people in care {{are more likely to be}} criminalised than their non-looked after peers (The Howard League for Penal Reform, 2016), with retrospective examinations of individuals in young offenders institutions and prisons finding they are disproportionately more likely to have been care experienced (Summerfield, 2011; Carnie and Broderick, 2015; Laming, 2016). In Scotland, less data is available and limited research attention has been paid to the responses by residential childcare workers <b>to</b> <b>offending</b> behaviour. <b>To</b> address these issues, this study aimed to: gather more data about police contact for offending by young people in children’s houses; to explore how practitioners make, and are supported to make, the decision to involve the police in incidents; and to survey what formal policies are in place within each local authority to aid decision making. This was achieved through the collation of ‘police contact data’ for young people placed in local authority run children’s houses over a period of six months; completion of an online survey by house managers asking them to describe the policy and/or practice guidance available to staff in relation <b>to</b> <b>offending</b> behaviour and police contact; and interviews with 27 residential workers, across two Scottish local authorities.
