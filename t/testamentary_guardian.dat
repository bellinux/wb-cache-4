5000|$|Historically, in {{the case}} of a minor, the father was prima facie the proper person to act as next friend; in the father's absence, the <b>testamentary</b> <b>guardian,</b> if any, was next friend; but any person not under {{disability}} could act as next friend so long as he has no interest in the action adverse to that of the minor. A married woman could not historically act as next friend but this practice is no longer current, at least in the United States, where either or both of a minor's parents may act as next friend. (An exception is in divorce cases or other cases affecting child custody; in such cases courts often appoint a guardian or attorney (independent of the parents) to represent the child's interests, which may not be aligned with either parent's interests.) ...|$|E
40|$|Designed {{as closely}} related to patria potestas, {{guardianship}} was formally understood as an aspect of potestas and a right exercised {{in the interest of}} the protected person until she or he reached puberty. Starting from the Principate, the initial approach to guardianship and to the role of the guardian starts to change. Guardianship potestas tended to shift into a guardianship similar to a charge (munus). Imperial policy then tended to harmonize the three types of guardianship following the model of the guardianship by magisterial appointment, in other words the idea was to coerce the guardian and in particular the <b>testamentary</b> <b>guardian</b> into making difficult for him to avoid the burden, accepting it and managing it efficiently. The purpose of this paper is not to analyse Marcus Aurelius’ generalisation (followed through by successive emperors) of the system of excuses, extended it to all types of guardianship, and forcing guardians to accept the office. This contribution rather focuses on the search for the correct balance between the wards’ interests and the guardians’ capacity to carry out his mandate effectively and efficiently. This is what we can deduct from a study of the rich casuistic dealing with the excuse grounds and from the shift of guardianship towards the category of civilian charges...|$|E

Consent to her marriage was given by John Osborn and John Atkinson as <b>testamentary</b> <b>guardians,</b> though she lived with Samuel Richardson (1684-1761) and was pictured {{with him and his}} family by Francis Hayman.|$|R
40|$|Many legal historians see pre- 1839 English {{child custody}} law as {{consisting}} of near-absolute paternal rights. These historians {{believe that the}} weakening of fathers 2 ̆ 7 rights began with the 1839 Custody of Infants Act, which created certain maternal custody rights. Other historians have noted that paternal custody was qualified even before 1839 by the Court of Chancerys application {{of the doctrine of}} parens patriae. This Note tells a different story and argues that the origin of incursions into the so-called 2 ̆ 2 empire of the father 2 ̆ 2 was the 1660 Tenures Abolition Act, a statute that ironically seemed designed to strengthen fathers 2 ̆ 7 rights. The Tenures Abolition Act granted fathers the right to appoint guardians to their children by will. According to Blackstone, the effect of the Act was to extend the father 2 ̆ 7 s empire 2 ̆ 2 even after his death. 2 ̆ 2 But by involving courts in child custody [...] even as enforcers of fathers 2 ̆ 7 rights [...] the Tenures Abolition Act created a tradition ofjudicial intervention that would eventually undermine those rights. This Note traces the development from 1660 to 1839 whereby court supervision of <b>testamentary</b> <b>guardians</b> led to court supervision offathers themselves, transforming the 2 ̆ 2 empire of the father 2 ̆ 2 into the empire of the judge...|$|R
